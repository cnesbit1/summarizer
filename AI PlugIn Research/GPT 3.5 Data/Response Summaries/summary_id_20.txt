Original Response: 
To distinguish between crossing over events that do not change linked genes and those that do, you need to analyze the resulting genetic combinations in the offspring.
Here’s how you can determine the difference:


1.
**Parental (Non-Recombinant) Chromosomes**: Chromosomes that retain the original combination of alleles from the parents.
2.
**Recombinant Chromosomes**: Chromosomes that have undergone crossing over and have new combinations of alleles.
1.
**Examine the Phenotypes of Offspring**:
   - **Non-Recombinant Offspring**: These offspring show phenotypes that match the parental types.
This indicates that no crossing over or crossing over that did not affect the linked genes occurred.
- **Recombinant Offspring**: These offspring show new phenotypes that are different from the parental types.
This indicates that crossing over occurred and affected the linked genes.
2.
**Calculate Recombination Frequency**:
   - **Recombination Frequency**: This is the percentage of recombinant offspring out of the total offspring.
It gives an indication of how often crossing over occurs between linked genes.
- **Formula**: \[ \text{Recombination Frequency} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Recombinant Offspring}}{\text{Total Number of Offspring}} \right) \times 100 \]
   - A low recombination frequency suggests that the genes are closely linked and crossing over between them is rare.
- A high recombination frequency suggests that crossing over between the genes is more common, which means they are farther apart on the chromosome.
3.
**Use Genetic Markers**:
   - **Genetic Markers**: These are specific sequences of DNA that can be used to track the presence of particular alleles.
By analyzing the presence or absence of these markers, you can determine whether crossing over has occurred.
- **Parental Markers**: Identify the genetic markers associated with the parental alleles.
- **Recombinant Markers**: Identify the genetic markers that indicate new combinations of alleles resulting from crossing over.
- Parent 1: AB/ab (linked genes on the same chromosome)
- Parent 2: ab/ab (homozygous recessive)

- **Parental Types**: AB/ab (non-recombinant), ab/ab (non-recombinant)
- **Recombinant Types**: Ab/ab (recombinant), aB/ab (recombinant)

1.
**Count the Offspring**:
   - If you observe a higher number of offspring with AB/ab and ab/ab phenotypes, this suggests that crossing over did not change the linked genes.
- If you observe a significant number of offspring with Ab/ab and aB/ab phenotypes, this indicates that crossing over has occurred and affected the linked genes.
2.
**Determine the Frequency**:
   - Suppose you have 100 offspring: 80 are parental types (40 AB/ab, 40 ab/ab) and 20 are recombinant types (10 Ab/ab, 10 aB/ab).
- Recombination frequency = (20/100) × 100 = 20%


- **No Change in Linked Genes**: If most offspring are of the parental type and recombination frequency is low, crossing over did not significantly affect the linked genes.
- **Change in Linked Genes**: If a substantial proportion of offspring are recombinant and recombination frequency is moderate to high, crossing over did affect the linked genes.
By analyzing the phenotypes and genotypes of the offspring and calculating the recombination frequency, you can determine whether crossing over has changed the linked genes.

Summary: 
This indicates that crossing over occurred and affected the linked genes.
This indicates that no crossing over or crossing over that did not affect the linked genes occurred.
**Recombinant Chromosomes**: Chromosomes that have undergone crossing over and have new combinations of alleles.
It gives an indication of how often crossing over occurs between linked genes.
