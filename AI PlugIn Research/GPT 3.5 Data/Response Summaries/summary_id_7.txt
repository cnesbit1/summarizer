Original Response: 
You're right to ask for clarification.
Let's revisit the space complexity analysis more carefully.
In the provided backtracking solution, the space complexity is primarily determined by the storage of the combinations in the `all_sums` list.
1.
Each valid combination found during the traversal is stored in the `all_sums` list.
2.
The number of valid combinations can vary depending on the input and can be as many as \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is the number of candidates in the worst case (each candidate can either be chosen or not chosen).
3.
Therefore, the space complexity is \( O(2^m) \), where \( m \) is the number of candidates.
I apologize for the oversight and appreciate the opportunity to clarify.
Thank you for your patience!
