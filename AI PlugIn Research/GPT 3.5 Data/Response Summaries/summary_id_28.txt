Original Response: 
Absolutely, you've captured the essence of Rushdie's postmodernist approach in "The Perforated Sheet."
By presenting multiple perspectives and employing magical realism, Rushdie challenges the notion of a singular truth and questions established narratives, whether they be colonial, nationalistic, or religious.
Instead, he invites readers to consider the complexity and ambiguity of reality, suggesting that truth is subjective and can be interpreted in various ways.
This emphasis on diverse perspectives and the blurring of boundaries between reality and fantasy contribute to a rich and nuanced exploration of truth and authority in the novel.
