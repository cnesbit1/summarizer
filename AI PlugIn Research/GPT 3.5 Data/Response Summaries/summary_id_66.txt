Original Response: 
In "Midaq Alley," Naguib Mahfouz employs fragmentation as a literary technique to reflect the disjointed and chaotic nature of urban life and the intricate web of relationships within the alley.
Fragmentation is evident in the narrative structure, where the story unfolds through fragmented episodes and vignettes, each offering glimpses into the lives of the diverse characters inhabiting the alley.
The narrative switches between different perspectives and subplots, creating a mosaic of interconnected stories that capture the multifaceted reality of the alley.
Moreover, the characters themselves embody fragmentation, as they grapple with fragmented identities, desires, and aspirations shaped by their social and economic circumstances.
This fragmentation mirrors the broader socio-political context of Egypt during the time period, marked by upheaval and uncertainty.
Through fragmentation, Mahfouz portrays the complexity and intricacy of life in Midaq Alley, inviting readers to navigate the fragmented landscape of human experience and relationships.
