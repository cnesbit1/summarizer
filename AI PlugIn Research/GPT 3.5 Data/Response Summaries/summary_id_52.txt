Original Response: 
Historically, Yoko Ogawa's "The Housekeeper and the Professor" was published in 2003 in Japan and later translated into English in 2009.
While it was not written during the early 20th century when the modernist literary movement was at its peak, it exhibits many characteristics that align with modernist literature.
These characteristics include the exploration of subjectivity, fragmented narrative structure, focus on everyday life, and thematic concerns with identity and connection.
Therefore, while the novel was not produced during the historical period traditionally associated with modernism, it reflects and engages with many of the same literary ideas and techniques that emerged during that time.
