Original Response: 
In the case of the provided backtracking solution for the combination sum problem, the time and space complexity are indeed closely related, but they are not necessarily identical.
1.
**Time Complexity**: The time complexity is determined by the number of valid combinations of candidates that sum up to the target value.
In the worst case, where all combinations are valid, the time complexity is exponential, \(O(2^m)\), where \(m\) is the number of candidates.
2.
**Space Complexity**: The space complexity, on the other hand, is determined by the storage required to hold all the valid combinations found during the traversal.
This also can be exponential in the worst case, \(O(2^m)\), where \(m\) is the number of candidates.
While both the time and space complexity exhibit exponential growth in terms of the number of candidates, they are not identical.
Time complexity refers to the number of operations performed, while space complexity refers to the amount of memory used during the execution of the algorithm.
So while they are related in this case, especially due to the recursive nature of the algorithm and the storage of all valid combinations, they are not necessarily identical.

Summary: 
This also can be exponential in the worst case, \(O(2^m)\), where \(m\) is the number of candidates.
