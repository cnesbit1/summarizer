Original Response: 
In "The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Yoko Ogawa, while there are instances where the narrative delves into the characters' thoughts and perceptions, the use of a genuine stream of consciousness technique is limited.
The novel primarily employs interior monologue rather than a pure stream of consciousness style.
The narrative often provides insights into the characters' inner worlds, allowing readers to understand their emotions, memories, and reflections.
However, these insights are typically presented in a more structured and controlled manner, resembling interior monologue rather than the unfiltered and chaotic flow of thoughts characteristic of stream of consciousness.
That said, there are moments in the novel where the narrative adopts a more free-flowing and introspective style, allowing glimpses into the characters' minds in a manner reminiscent of stream of consciousness.
These moments tend to occur during moments of intense emotion or deep reflection, providing readers with a more intimate understanding of the characters' inner workings.
While not pure stream of consciousness, these passages contribute to the overall richness of the narrative and the exploration of the characters' psyches.

Summary: 
The novel primarily employs interior monologue rather than a pure stream of consciousness style.
