Original Response: 


Genes that are located close to each other on the same chromosome are referred to as linked genes.
These genes tend to be inherited together because the likelihood of a recombination event (crossing over) occurring between them is relatively low.
This linkage can interfere with Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during the formation of gametes.
Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment applies to genes that are located on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome, where the segregation of one gene's alleles is not influenced by the segregation of another gene's alleles.
However, linked genes do not assort independently because their proximity on the same chromosome means they are often inherited together, leading to a deviation from the expected Mendelian ratios.
The inheritance pattern of linked genes does not disprove Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment because this law primarily applies to genes on different chromosomes or genes that are far apart on the same chromosome.
Mendel's experiments were conducted using traits that are controlled by genes located on different chromosomes or sufficiently far apart on the same chromosome, where independent assortment holds true.
The discovery of gene linkage added complexity to genetic inheritance but did not negate the principles Mendel observed.
Crossing over is a process that occurs during prophase I of meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of genetic material.
This process can "unlink" genes that are located on the same chromosome by physically exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes.
When crossing over occurs between linked genes, it can create new combinations of alleles, leading to genetic recombination.
1.
**Homologous Pairing**: Homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I of meiosis.
2.
**Synapsis and Chiasma Formation**: Chromatids from homologous chromosomes form a synaptonemal complex and exchange segments at points called chiasmata.
3.
**Recombination**: The exchange of genetic material between chromatids results in recombinant chromosomes, which have a mix of alleles from both parents.
4.
**Separation**: The homologous chromosomes separate into different gametes, carrying new combinations of linked genes.
- **Before Crossing Over**: Linked genes tend to be inherited together, resulting in a lower frequency of recombinant phenotypes.
- **After Crossing Over**: Recombination increases the genetic variation by producing new allele combinations, which can appear as if the genes assort independently, despite being linked.
- **Linked genes**: Tend to be inherited together due to their proximity on the same chromosome.
- **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment**: Applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
- **Crossing over**: During meiosis can unlink genes by exchanging segments of homologous chromosomes, leading to genetic recombination.
- **Recombination**: Results in new allele combinations, making inheritance patterns appear more independent even for linked genes.
By understanding these processes, we see that while linked genes may interfere with the independent assortment, crossing over provides a mechanism that introduces variability and adheres to the broader principles of genetic inheritance described by Mendel.

Summary: 


Genes that are located close to each other on the same chromosome are referred to as linked genes.
- **Linked genes**: Tend to be inherited together due to their proximity on the same chromosome.
- **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment**: Applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
