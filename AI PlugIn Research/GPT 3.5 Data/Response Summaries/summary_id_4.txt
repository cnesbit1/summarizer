Original Response: 
This code implements the combination sum problem using backtracking.
The problem asks to find all unique combinations of candidates that sum up to the target value.
Here's how the solution works:

1.
The `backtracker` function is a recursive function that explores all possible combinations of candidates to reach the target sum.
2.
It takes three parameters:
   - `start`: This parameter is used to ensure that we don't reuse elements that have already been considered.
It helps in avoiding duplicate combinations.
- `sum_path`: This parameter keeps track of the current combination being explored.
- `target`: This parameter keeps track of the remaining sum that needs to be achieved.
3.
Inside the `backtracker` function:
   - If the `target` becomes 0, it means we have found a valid combination that sums up to the target.
In this case, we append the current combination (`sum_path`) to the `all_sums` list.
- If the `target` becomes negative, it means the current combination has exceeded the target sum, so we backtrack and return.
- Otherwise, we iterate over the candidates starting from the `start` index and recursively call the `backtracker` function with updated parameters:
     - `start` remains the same to allow reuse of the same element.
- `sum_path + [candidates[i]]` adds the current candidate to the current combination being explored.
- `target - candidates[i]` updates the remaining target sum after considering the current candidate.
4.
After exploring all possible combinations, the `all_sums` list contains all valid combinations, which is then returned.
This approach effectively explores all possible combinations without duplicates, thanks to the backtracking mechanism and the use of the `start` parameter to avoid revisiting elements.

Summary: 
It helps in avoiding duplicate combinations.
- `sum_path`: This parameter keeps track of the current combination being explored.
