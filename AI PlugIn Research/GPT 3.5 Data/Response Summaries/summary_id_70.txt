Original Response: 
"Midaq Alley" employs fragmentation through various narrative techniques.
Firstly, the story incorporates abrupt shifts, swiftly moving from one character's perspective to another without smooth transitions.
For instance, in one scene, the focus abruptly shifts from Kirsha's thoughts to Salim Alwan's concerns about his business, creating a jarring transition (Chapter 4).
This technique disrupts the narrative flow and contributes to a sense of disjunction and fragmentation.
Additionally, the narrative employs discontinuous time, with frequent flashbacks and flash-forwards that disrupt the chronological order of events.
For example, in Chapter 6, there is a flashback to Hamida's childhood, followed by a return to the present timeline.
These temporal shifts fragment the storyline and challenge the reader's sense of coherence.
The use of multiple points of view also adds to the fragmented nature of the narrative.
Characters like Kirsha, Hamida, and Abbas narrate their experiences and viewpoints, offering disjointed glimpses into their lives.
In Chapter 7, for instance, the narrative switches between different characters' perspectives, creating a mosaic of voices and viewpoints.
Furthermore, the story features parallel plotlines that intersect and diverge, depicting the interconnected yet fragmented lives of the alley's inhabitants.
For example, the storyline of Hamida's romantic pursuits intersects with Abbas's aspirations, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings (Chapter 10).
Lastly, sudden scene changes occur throughout the narrative, with scenes ending abruptly or transitioning suddenly to different locations or characters.
In Chapter 12, for instance, the scene shifts abruptly from Hamida's confrontation with Abbas to Dr. Booshy's clinic.
These transitions serve to emphasize the fragmented reality of urban life and human relationships portrayed in "Midaq Alley."

Summary: 
"Midaq Alley" employs fragmentation through various narrative techniques.
This technique disrupts the narrative flow and contributes to a sense of disjunction and fragmentation.
