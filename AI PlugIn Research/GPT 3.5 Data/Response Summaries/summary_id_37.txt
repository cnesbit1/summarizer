Original Response: 
Interior monologue and stream of consciousness are both narrative techniques used to convey a character's thoughts, feelings, and perceptions.
However, they differ in their presentation and execution:

1.
**Interior Monologue**:
   - **Definition**: Interior monologue refers to the direct presentation of a character's thoughts in a structured and coherent manner.
It often takes the form of uninterrupted paragraphs or passages that reflect the character's inner dialogue.
- **Characteristics**:
     - Typically presented in grammatically correct sentences and paragraphs.
- Reflects a more organized and controlled flow of thoughts.
- Often used to provide insight into a character's motivations, reflections, and decision-making process.
- **Example**: "As I sat by the window, watching the rain cascade down the glass, my mind wandered to memories of childhood.
I remembered the sound of laughter, the warmth of family gatherings, and the innocence of youth.
It was a bittersweet nostalgia, tinged with longing and regret."
2.
**Stream of Consciousness**:
   - **Definition**: Stream of consciousness is a narrative technique that attempts to replicate the continuous flow of thoughts, impressions, and sensations passing through a character's mind.
It aims to capture the chaotic and unfiltered nature of human thought.
- **Characteristics**:
     - Often lacks punctuation, sentence structure, or logical organization, resembling a stream of thoughts without interruption.
- May include fragmented phrases, associations, and sensory impressions.
- Mimics the spontaneous and nonlinear nature of human consciousness.
- **Example**: "Raindrops on the window.
Childhood memories.
Laughter.
Family.
Regret?
No, longing.
Longing for what?
Warmth.
Innocence.
Lost in the past.
Can't go back.
Must move forward.
Rain keeps falling.
Tears on the glass.
Inside and out.
Where am I?"
In summary, interior monologue presents a character's thoughts in a structured and coherent manner, while stream of consciousness seeks to replicate the unfiltered and continuous flow of thoughts as they occur in the mind.

Summary: 
- Reflects a more organized and controlled flow of thoughts.
- **Example**: "Raindrops on the window.
- Mimics the spontaneous and nonlinear nature of human consciousness.
It was a bittersweet nostalgia, tinged with longing and regret."
