Original Response: 
Yes, the definition provided is correct, but let's ensure it's clear and comprehensive.
Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism that have the same structure, length, and gene sequence.
Each pair consists of one chromosome inherited from the organism's mother and one from the father.
These chromosomes carry the same genes at corresponding loci (positions), but they may carry different alleles for those genes.
For example, if a gene for eye color is located at a specific locus on a chromosome, the corresponding homologous chromosome will also have a gene for eye color at the same locus, though one may carry the allele for brown eyes and the other for blue eyes.
- **Same Structure**: Homologous chromosomes are similar in size and shape.
- **Same Genes**: They carry the same genes in the same order.
- **Different Alleles**: While they carry the same genes, the specific versions (alleles) of those genes may differ.
- **Inheritance**: One homologous chromosome is inherited from each parent.
If you need further clarification or have more questions, please let me know!

Summary: 
- **Same Genes**: They carry the same genes in the same order.
