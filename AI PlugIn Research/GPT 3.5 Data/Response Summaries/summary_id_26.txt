"The Perforated Sheet" by Salman Rushdie exhibits several characteristics of postmodernist literature:

1.
**Metafictional Elements**: The story includes self-reflexive elements where the narrator acknowledges the act of storytelling.
For example, the narrator directly addresses the reader and comments on the process of writing the narrative.
2.

This fragmentation mirrors the fragmented nature of contemporary experience and challenges traditional narrative conventions.

For instance, the story incorporates elements of magical realism alongside realistic depictions of everyday life.

By presenting multiple perspectives and challenging dominant ideologies, Rushdie undermines fixed notions of identity and history.
