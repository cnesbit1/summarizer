Original Response: 
postmodernist literary techniques used in Salman Rushdie's "The Perforated Sheet," particularly the incorporation of magical realism.
This narrative style blends fantastical elements with reality seamlessly, creating a unique and surreal atmosphere.
In the passage you provided, Rushdie employs magical realism to depict the anticipation surrounding Saleem Sinai's birth.
The idea that Saleem's arrival is prophesied, celebrated in newspapers, and ratified by politicians adds an element of the fantastical to his birth, elevating it to a status akin to that of a messianic figure like Jesus Christ.
This juxtaposition of the extraordinary with the mundane is characteristic of magical realism, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.
Similarly, Tai's response to Doctor Aziz's question about his age also showcases magical realism.
Tai's claim to have witnessed the birth of mountains and the death of emperors positions him outside the realm of ordinary human experience.
Yet, instead of being questioned or dismissed, Tai's fantastical age is accepted without question, adding to the surreal nature of the narrative.
Overall, Rushdie's use of magical realism in "The Perforated Sheet" serves to enhance the thematic depth of the story and offers readers a unique lens through which to explore complex themes such as identity, history, and tradition.

Summary: 
Similarly, Tai's response to Doctor Aziz's question about his age also showcases magical realism.
