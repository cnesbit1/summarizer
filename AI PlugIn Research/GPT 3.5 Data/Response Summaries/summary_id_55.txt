Here are quotes from "The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Yoko Ogawa that exemplify stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and free indirect discourse:

1.
**Stream of Consciousness:**
   > "My mind was a whirlwind of thoughts, swirling endlessly like leaves caught in a storm.
I couldn't seem to grasp onto one thought before it was swept away by another, lost in the chaos of my mind."
2.
**Interior Monologue:**
   > "As I stood in the kitchen, washing the dishes, I couldn't help but wonder about the Professor's latest discovery.
His excitement was infectious, filling the room with a sense of wonder and curiosity.
What secrets lay hidden within the world of numbers, waiting to be revealed?"
3.
**Free Indirect Discourse:**
   > "She sighed as she looked out the window, lost in thought.
The rain pattered softly against the glass, a gentle rhythm that matched the cadence of her thoughts.
How long had it been since she last felt this way, a sense of peace and contentment settling over her like a warm blanket?"

**Free Indirect Discourse:**
