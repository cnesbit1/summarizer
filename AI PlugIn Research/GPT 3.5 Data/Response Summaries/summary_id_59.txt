Original Response: 
"Midaq Alley" by Naguib Mahfouz incorporates several postmodernist literary techniques, including:

1.
Fragmentation: The narrative structure of "Midaq Alley" is fragmented, with the story being told through a series of interconnected vignettes or episodes, each focusing on different characters and their lives in the alley.
This fragmentation mirrors the fragmented nature of urban life and society.
2.
Metafiction: Mahfouz employs metafictional elements by drawing attention to the act of storytelling itself.
Characters in the novel often engage in storytelling or gossiping about each other, blurring the lines between reality and fiction within the narrative.
3.
Intertextuality: The novel contains references to various cultural, historical, and literary texts, which enrich the layers of meaning within the story.
These intertextual references invite readers to make connections between "Midaq Alley" and other texts, thereby expanding the interpretation of the novel.
4.
Irony: Mahfouz uses irony to highlight the contradictions and complexities of life in Midaq Alley.
The characters' aspirations and desires often lead to unexpected consequences, and the gap between their expectations and reality is underscored through ironic situations and dialogue.
5.
Parody: The novel parodies certain social conventions and norms prevalent in Egyptian society, particularly those related to gender roles, class distinctions, and religious beliefs.
This parody serves as a critique of societal norms and values.
Overall, "Midaq Alley" employs these postmodernist literary techniques to offer a multifaceted portrayal of life in a Cairo alley, challenging traditional narrative structures and inviting readers to engage with complex themes of identity, community, and social change.

Summary: 
This fragmentation mirrors the fragmented nature of urban life and society.
This parody serves as a critique of societal norms and values.
