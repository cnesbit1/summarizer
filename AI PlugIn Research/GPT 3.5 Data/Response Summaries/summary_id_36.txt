Original Response: 
Certainly, here are more examples of modernist literary techniques used in "The Housekeeper and the Professor":

1.
**Interior Monologue**: "As I prepared the Professor's meals, my mind would often wander to the past – memories of my childhood, my family, and the dreams I once had.
It was as if the act of cooking became a meditation, a way to escape the confines of the present and journey into the depths of my own psyche."
2.
**Fragmentation**: "The Professor's thoughts were like fragments of a shattered mirror, scattered across the landscape of his mind.
It was my job to piece them together, to make sense of the disjointed puzzle that was his memory.
But sometimes, no matter how hard I tried, there were pieces missing – lost forever to the ravages of time."
3.
**Juxtaposition**: "In the quiet of the evening, I would sit with the Professor at the kitchen table, surrounded by books and papers filled with equations and theories.
Outside, the world was alive with the sounds of nature – birds chirping, leaves rustling in the wind.
It was a juxtaposition of two worlds – the intellectual realm of academia and the simple beauty of everyday life."
4.
**Symbolism**: "The Professor's old, worn-out baseball cap was a symbol of his past – a reminder of the person he once was, before his memory began to fade.
It was a tangible link to a time long gone, a relic of a bygone era that held a special place in his heart."
5.
**Temporal Dislocation**: "As I listened to the Professor recount stories from his youth, it was as if time itself had become dislocated – past, present, and future merging into one seamless continuum.
It was a surreal experience, witnessing history unfold before my eyes, blurring the boundaries between memory and reality."
These techniques contribute to the novel's rich and complex narrative, offering insights into the characters' inner worlds and the themes of memory, identity, and human connection.

Summary: 
It was my job to piece them together, to make sense of the disjointed puzzle that was his memory.
