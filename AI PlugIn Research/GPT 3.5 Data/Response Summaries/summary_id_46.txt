Despite these obstacles, they discover profound connections through their shared passions for baseball and mathematics.
Through their interactions, they find moments of joy and understanding that transcend their individual struggles.
This exploration of human connection as a source of truth aligns with the modernist idea that truth is subjective and multifaceted, and that it can be found in the complexities of human experience rather than in traditional sources of authority or knowledge.
The relationships forged between the Professor, the Housekeeper, and Root demonstrate the transformative power of connection, offering new perspectives on identity, memory, and the pursuit of meaning in an uncertain world.
