Original Response: 
In this excerpt from Salman Rushdie's "Midnight's Children," several elements of magical realism are woven into the narrative:

1.
**Tai's shikara:** Tai's boat, adorned with flowered-patterned curtains and canopy, along with cushions and incense, becomes a symbol of the fusion of the ordinary and the magical.
The boat itself is a mundane object, used for transportation, but its embellishments and the atmosphere it creates evoke a sense of enchantment.
2.
**Tai's storytelling:** Tai's storytelling is described as "magical talk," with words flowing from him like "fools' money," creating a sense of wonder and imagination.
His stories span from the remote Himalayas of the past to present details, blending history and mythology with the everyday.
3.
**Tai's age and experiences:** Tai's claim of having seen mountains being born and witnessing historical figures like Christ visiting Kashmir adds a layer of mysticism to his character.
His assertions, although fantastical, are presented matter-of-factly, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy.
4.
**The interaction between Doctor Aziz and Tai:** The exchange between Doctor Aziz and Tai, particularly Tai's cryptic response about his age and his experiences with historical figures, adds an element of mystery and magic to their relationship.
Tai's enigmatic nature and his ability to weave tales contribute to the magical realism of the scene.
Overall, this passage illustrates how magical realism permeates the everyday lives of the characters, intertwining the mundane with the extraordinary and blurring the boundaries between reality and imagination.

Summary: 
Tai's enigmatic nature and his ability to weave tales contribute to the magical realism of the scene.
