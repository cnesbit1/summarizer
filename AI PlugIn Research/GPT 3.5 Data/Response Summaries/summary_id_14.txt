Original Response: 
Linked genes are genes located close to each other on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together because they are less likely to be separated during meiosis.
This linkage can interfere with Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment, which states that alleles of different genes assort independently of one another during gamete formation.
Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment assumes that genes are located on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome.
This law holds true when genes are unlinked, meaning their inheritance is not influenced by their proximity to each other.
However, linked genes do not assort independently because they are physically close on the same chromosome and tend to be inherited together.
As a result, the expected ratios of offspring phenotypes can deviate from those predicted by independent assortment.
The inheritance pattern of linked genes does not disprove Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment because this law applies to genes located on different chromosomes or genes that are far apart on the same chromosome.
Mendel's experiments were primarily based on traits controlled by genes located on different chromosomes, where independent assortment holds true.
The discovery of linked genes added complexity to genetic inheritance but did not negate the principles Mendel observed.
Crossing over is a process that occurs during prophase I of meiosis, where homologous chromosomes exchange segments of genetic material.
This process can "unlink" genes that are located on the same chromosome by physically exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes.
When crossing over occurs, it can break the linkage between genes and result in new combinations of alleles that are different from those present in the parent organisms.
1.
**Homologous Pairing**: Homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I of meiosis.
2.
**Synapsis and Chiasma Formation**: Chromatids from homologous chromosomes form a synaptonemal complex and exchange segments at points called chiasmata.
3.
**Recombination**: The exchange of genetic material between chromatids results in recombinant chromosomes, which have a mix of alleles from both parents.
4.
**Separation**: The homologous chromosomes separate into different gametes, carrying new combinations of linked genes.
- **Before Crossing Over**: Linked genes tend to be inherited together, resulting in a lower frequency of recombinant phenotypes.
- **After Crossing Over**: Recombination increases the genetic variation by producing new allele combinations, which can appear as if the genes assort independently, despite being linked.
- **Linked genes** tend to be inherited together because of their physical proximity on the same chromosome.
- **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment** applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
- **Crossing over** during meiosis can unlink genes by exchanging segments of homologous chromosomes, leading to new combinations of alleles.
- **Recombination** resulting from crossing over can create genetic diversity and affect inheritance patterns, making them appear more in line with independent assortment despite initial linkage.

Summary: 
- **Linked genes** tend to be inherited together because of their physical proximity on the same chromosome.
- **Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment** applies to genes on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
This process can "unlink" genes that are located on the same chromosome by physically exchanging segments between homologous chromosomes.
