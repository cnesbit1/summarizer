Determining if a disorder is autosomal recessive or X-linked recessive based on a pedigree involves analyzing the inheritance patterns across generations.
Here are the key characteristics to look for in each type of inheritance:


1.
**Affected individuals** often have unaffected parents.
- Both parents of an affected individual are typically carriers (heterozygous) for the recessive allele.
2.
**Equal frequency** in both sexes.
- Both males and females are equally likely to be affected.
3.
**Skipping generations**.
- The disorder can appear to skip generations if carriers do not express the trait.
4.
**Consanguinity** (mating between relatives) might increase the likelihood of the disorder.
- Increased likelihood of two carriers mating and producing affected offspring.
1.
**More males affected** than females.
- Males have only one X chromosome, so a single recessive allele on the X chromosome will result in the disorder.
2.
**Affected males** are usually born to carrier mothers.
- The mother passes the affected X chromosome to her son.
3.
**No male-to-male transmission**.
- Fathers do not pass the X chromosome to their sons; they pass the Y chromosome.
4.
**Affected females** are rare and usually have affected fathers and carrier or affected mothers.
- For a female to be affected, she must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent).
1.
**Identify the affected individuals**.
- Note the pattern of affected individuals across generations.
2.
**Check the sex distribution**.
- If more males are affected than females, and if there are no male-to-male transmissions, suspect X-linked recessive inheritance.
- If the disorder affects both sexes equally, consider autosomal recessive inheritance.
3.
**Analyze parental genotypes**.
- For affected individuals with unaffected parents, consider autosomal recessive inheritance where both parents are carriers.
- For affected males with unaffected parents, consider X-linked recessive inheritance where the mother is a carrier.
4.
**Look for skipping generations**.
- Autosomal recessive disorders often skip generations if carriers do not express the trait.
- X-linked recessive disorders can also skip generations but will show a characteristic pattern of carrier mothers and affected sons.
5.
**Assess family relationships**.
- If consanguinity is present, autosomal recessive disorders are more likely.
- Both males and females affected.
- Affected individuals have unaffected parents (carriers).
- Disorder appears to skip generations.
- More males than females affected.
- Affected males often have carrier mothers.
- No father-to-son transmission.
- Affected females rare and have affected fathers and carrier or affected mothers.
By carefully examining these patterns, you can determine the most likely mode of inheritance for a given disorder in a pedigree.

Summary: 
- Both males and females affected.
**More males affected** than females.
- More males than females affected.
- Affected males often have carrier mothers.
- Affected individuals have unaffected parents (carriers).
- Disorder appears to skip generations.
**Affected individuals** often have unaffected parents.
