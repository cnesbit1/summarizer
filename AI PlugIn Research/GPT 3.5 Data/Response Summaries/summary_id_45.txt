Original Response: 
In "The Housekeeper and the Professor," the Housekeeper's son is a character who is never explicitly named.
He is simply referred to as "Root" by the Professor because the number "root" (or square root) of his shoe size is one of the few numbers the Professor can remember due to his memory impairment.
Root is a young boy who forms a close bond with the Professor through their shared love of mathematics.
Despite the challenges posed by the Professor's memory loss, Root finds a friend and mentor in him, and their relationship becomes an important aspect of the story's exploration of human connection and companionship.
