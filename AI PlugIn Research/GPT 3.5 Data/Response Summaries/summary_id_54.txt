Original Response: 
Modernist literature employs a variety of literary techniques to convey its themes, ideas, and aesthetic principles.
Some of the key literary techniques associated with modernism include:

1.
**Stream of Consciousness:** This technique aims to capture the continuous flow of thoughts, feelings, and associations within a character's mind, often without conventional punctuation or structure.
2.
**Fragmentation:** Modernist works frequently feature fragmented narratives, disjointed or non-linear storytelling, and fragmented or disrupted chronology.
3.
**Interior Monologue:** Similar to stream of consciousness, interior monologue presents the inner thoughts and reflections of a character, often in a more structured or coherent form than stream of consciousness.
4.
**Symbolism:** Modernist writers often use symbols to convey abstract ideas, emotions, or themes, allowing readers to interpret the text on multiple levels.
5.
**Allusion:** Modernist literature frequently makes use of literary, historical, or cultural allusions, referencing other texts, events, or figures to enrich meaning and create intertextual connections.
6.
**Experimental Structure:** Modernist works may experiment with narrative structure, employing unconventional techniques such as collage, juxtaposition, or nonlinear storytelling.
7.
**Dislocation of Time and Space:** Modernist literature often disrupts traditional notions of time and space, presenting fragmented or non-chronological narratives that reflect the disorienting experience of modern life.
8.
**Alienation and Disillusionment:** Many modernist works explore themes of alienation, isolation, and disillusionment, depicting characters struggling to find meaning or connection in a rapidly changing world.
9.
**Metafiction:** Modernist writers sometimes employ metafictional techniques, drawing attention to the artifice of storytelling and blurring the boundaries between fiction and reality.
10.
**Free Indirect Discourse:** This narrative technique allows the author to convey a character's thoughts or feelings indirectly, blending the character's perspective with the narrator's voice.
These techniques collectively contribute to the distinct aesthetic and thematic characteristics of modernist literature, reflecting the movement's emphasis on experimentation, subjectivity, and the complexities of modern experience.
