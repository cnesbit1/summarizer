Original Response: 
"The Housekeeper and the Professor" by Yoko Ogawa exhibits characteristics of both modernist and postmodernist literature, but it aligns more closely with modernism.
While the novel incorporates elements of fragmentation and non-linear narrative, which are often associated with postmodernism, its focus on human relationships, the exploration of memory, and the pursuit of meaning in a seemingly chaotic world are themes more commonly found in modernist literature.
Additionally, the storytelling style in "The Housekeeper and the Professor" is relatively straightforward and lacks the overt self-awareness and metafictional elements often present in postmodernist works.
Overall, while the novel may contain some postmodernist elements, its thematic concerns and narrative style are more indicative of modernist literature.
