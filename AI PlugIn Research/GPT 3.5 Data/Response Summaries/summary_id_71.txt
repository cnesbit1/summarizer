Original Response: 
"Midaq Alley" challenges the notion of objective truth by presenting multiple subjective perspectives and experiences.
Through its fragmented narrative and shifting points of view, the novel suggests that truth is inherently subjective and dependent on individual perception.
Each character in the alley has their own version of reality shaped by personal biases, desires, and experiences.
For example, Kirsha's truth is influenced by his hedonistic lifestyle and disregard for societal norms, while Hamida's truth is shaped by her aspirations for a better life.
Additionally, the novel highlights the relativity of truth through its portrayal of social dynamics and power structures within the alley.
Characters like Abbas and Salim Alwan wield influence and authority, shaping the truth according to their own interests and agendas.
Moreover, the narrative's use of metafiction further blurs the line between reality and fiction, calling into question the very nature of truth in storytelling.
By presenting a fragmented and multifaceted portrayal of life in Midaq Alley, the novel suggests that truth is not a fixed entity but rather a subjective construct influenced by individual perspectives and experiences.

Summary: 
Each character in the alley has their own version of reality shaped by personal biases, desires, and experiences.
