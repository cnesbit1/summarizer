Original Response: 
In the case of an X-linked recessive disorder, an unaffected father cannot have affected children, whether male or female.
This is due to the way X-linked recessive inheritance works:

1.
**Males** have one X chromosome (from their mother) and one Y chromosome (from their father).
2.
**Females** have two X chromosomes, one from each parent.
- **Father's Genotype**: XY (with a normal X chromosome)
- **Mother's Genotype**: 
  - XX (if unaffected and not a carrier)
  - X^aX (if a carrier of the recessive allele)

- **Sons**: 
  - Sons inherit the Y chromosome from the father and one X chromosome from the mother.
- Sons cannot inherit the X chromosome from the father; they inherit their X chromosome from the mother.
- If the mother is a carrier (X^aX), there is a 50% chance that the son will inherit the affected X chromosome (X^aY) and be affected.
- **Daughters**: 
  - Daughters inherit one X chromosome from the father and one X chromosome from the mother.
- Daughters will inherit the normal X chromosome from the father (X).
- If the mother is a carrier (X^aX), there is a 50% chance that the daughter will inherit the affected X chromosome from the mother, making her a carrier (X^aX).
- For a daughter to be affected (X^aX^a), she would need to inherit the affected X chromosome from both parents, which is not possible if the father is unaffected.
- **Sons and Daughters**:
  - All children will inherit the normal X chromosome from the father.
- Sons will inherit a normal X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father, making them unaffected.
- Daughters will inherit a normal X chromosome from both parents, making them unaffected.
- An unaffected father (with a normal X chromosome) **cannot** pass an X-linked recessive disorder to any of his children.
- Affected males must inherit the X-linked recessive allele from their mother.
- Females can only be affected if they inherit two copies of the recessive allele (one from each parent), but an unaffected father cannot provide the affected allele.
Therefore, an unaffected father cannot have affected children of either sex if the disorder is X-linked recessive.

Summary: 
- Daughters will inherit the normal X chromosome from the father (X).
**Females** have two X chromosomes, one from each parent.
