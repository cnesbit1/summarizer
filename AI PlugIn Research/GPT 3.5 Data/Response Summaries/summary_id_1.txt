Original Response: 
The time complexity of the `levelOrder` function is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.
The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
This is because at any given time, the queue can contain at most all the nodes of a particular level in the binary tree, which can be as many as n/2 nodes in the case of a complete binary tree.
Therefore, the space required for the queue is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
