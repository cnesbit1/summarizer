Original Response: 

The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism, referring specifically to the set of alleles it possesses for a particular gene or set of genes.
The genotype determines the potential traits an organism can pass on to its offspring and can influence the organism's phenotype.
For example, in the case of a gene with two alleles, A (dominant) and a (recessive):

- An organism with the genotype AA is homozygous dominant.
- An organism with the genotype aa is homozygous recessive.
- An organism with the genotype Aa is heterozygous.
The genotype, in combination with environmental factors, contributes to the overall phenotype of the organism.
