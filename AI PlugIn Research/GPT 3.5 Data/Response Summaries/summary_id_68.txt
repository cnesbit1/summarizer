Original Response: 
Certainly, here's a revised explanation:

"Midaq Alley" employs fragmentation through various narrative transitions.
Firstly, the story incorporates abrupt shifts, swiftly moving from one character's perspective to another without smooth transitions.
This technique disrupts the narrative flow and contributes to a sense of disjunction and fragmentation.
Additionally, the narrative employs discontinuous time, with frequent flashbacks and flash-forwards that disrupt the chronological order of events, further fragmenting the storyline.
The use of multiple points of view also adds to the fragmented nature of the narrative, as different characters narrate their experiences and viewpoints, offering disjointed glimpses into their lives.
Furthermore, the story features parallel plotlines that intersect and diverge, depicting the interconnected yet fragmented lives of the alley's inhabitants.
Lastly, sudden scene changes occur throughout the narrative, with scenes ending abruptly or transitioning suddenly to different locations or characters.
These transitions serve to emphasize the fragmented reality of urban life and human relationships portrayed in "Midaq Alley."

Summary: 
This technique disrupts the narrative flow and contributes to a sense of disjunction and fragmentation.
