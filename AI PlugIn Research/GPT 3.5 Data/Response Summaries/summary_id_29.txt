Original Response: 
Yoko Ogawa's "The Housekeeper and the Professor" also employs several postmodernist literary techniques:

1.
**Fragmentation:** The narrative is structured in a fragmented manner, mirroring the fragmented memory of the Professor due to his amnesia.
The story unfolds in brief, interconnected episodes that create a mosaic-like narrative.
2.
**Metafiction:** The novel often reflects on the nature of storytelling itself, blurring the line between fiction and reality.
Through the Housekeeper's interactions with the Professor and her efforts to understand his world, the novel comments on the act of storytelling and its role in shaping identity.
3.
**Intertextuality:** Ogawa weaves references to mathematics and baseball throughout the novel, enriching the text with intertextual layers.
These references serve to deepen the thematic exploration of memory, identity, and human connection.
4.
**Temporal Distortion:** The novel plays with time, especially through the Professor's memory loss.
Events from the past and present converge, and the boundaries between memory and reality become blurred.
This temporal distortion highlights the fluidity of memory and its subjective nature.
5.
**Exploration of Subjectivity:** Through the perspectives of the Housekeeper and the Professor, the novel explores the subjective nature of experience and memory.
Each character's perception of reality is unique, reflecting the postmodernist notion that truth is subjective and dependent on individual perspective.
Overall, "The Housekeeper and the Professor" utilizes these postmodernist techniques to create a rich and multilayered narrative that invites readers to contemplate the nature of memory, identity, and human connection.

Summary: 
This temporal distortion highlights the fluidity of memory and its subjective nature.
**Temporal Distortion:** The novel plays with time, especially through the Professor's memory loss.
