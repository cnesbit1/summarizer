Original Response: 
"Midaq Alley" by Naguib Mahfouz is generally considered more modernist in its literary techniques.
It employs techniques such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and fragmented narrative to depict the complex inner lives and experiences of its characters.
The narrative structure also reflects modernist sensibilities, focusing on the individual's subjective perception of reality and exploring themes of alienation, identity, and social change.
While there may be elements of postmodernism in its narrative complexity and metafictional elements, the overall style and approach align more closely with modernist conventions.
