**Kirsha's Internal Turmoil:** As Kirsha wrestles with his inner conflicts and desires, his stream of consciousness reveals his inner turmoil: "A whirlwind of thoughts spun in Kirsha's mind.
He grappled with his fading youth, his unfulfilled dreams, and the ache of unrequited love for his wife.
Was this all life had to offer?
Would he ever find contentment?"
2.
**Hamida's Ambitions and Fantasies:** Hamida's stream of consciousness reflects her aspirations and fantasies of a better life: "In her daydreams, Hamida envisioned herself adorned in luxurious attire, residing in a lavish mansion, admired by all.
She yearned for wealth, prestige, and admiration, fueling her relentless pursuit of success at any cost."
3.
**Abbas's Conflicted Feelings:** Abbas's internal struggle and confusion regarding his feelings for Hamida are depicted through his stream of consciousness: "Confusion clouded Abbas's mind as he grappled with conflicting emotions.
He loved Hamida deeply, yet he harbored doubts about their future together.

These examples offer a more nuanced portrayal of the characters' inner thoughts and emotions, providing deeper insight into their psyches and motivations.
