Original Response: 
Yes, that definition is correct.
An organism is considered homozygous for a gene if it has two identical alleles for that gene.
This means that both alleles at a specific locus on homologous chromosomes are the same.
To elaborate:

- **Homozygous dominant**: An individual has two copies of the dominant allele (e.g., AA).
- **Homozygous recessive**: An individual has two copies of the recessive allele (e.g., aa).
Being homozygous means there is no variation in the alleles for that particular gene, which often leads to the expression of the trait associated with those alleles.
If you have further questions or need more clarification, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
Yes, that definition is correct.
