Original Response: 
Yoko Ogawa's "The Housekeeper and the Professor" exhibits several characteristics that align with the modernist literary movement:

1.
**Exploration of Subjectivity:** The novel delves into the subjective experiences and inner thoughts of its characters, emphasizing their individual perspectives and emotional landscapes.
This focus on subjectivity is a hallmark of modernist literature, which often seeks to depict the complexities of human consciousness.
2.
**Fragmentation of Narrative:** Ogawa employs a fragmented narrative structure, with the story unfolding through a series of interconnected vignettes rather than following a linear plot progression.
This fragmentation disrupts traditional narrative conventions and reflects the modernist tendency to experiment with form and structure.
3.
**Interplay of Memory and Reality:** Memory plays a central role in the novel, blurring the boundaries between past and present.
The Professor's memory loss and the Housekeeper's efforts to navigate his condition highlight the fluidity of memory and its influence on individual identity—a theme commonly explored in modernist literature.
4.
**Focus on Everyday Life:** "The Housekeeper and the Professor" foregrounds the mundane details of everyday life, elevating seemingly ordinary moments into profound reflections on human existence.
This attention to the minutiae of daily experience mirrors the modernist fascination with the "everyday" and the search for meaning within the ordinary.
5.
**Themes of Identity and Connection:** The novel grapples with themes of identity, connection, and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent world—themes that resonate with the existential concerns often addressed in modernist literature.
The characters' quest for understanding and their interactions with one another reflect the modernist preoccupation with the individual's place in society and the universe.
Overall, Yoko Ogawa's "The Housekeeper and the Professor" embodies key characteristics of modernist literature through its exploration of subjectivity, fragmented narrative structure, interplay of memory and reality, focus on everyday life, and thematic concerns with identity and connection.

Summary: 
This fragmentation disrupts traditional narrative conventions and reflects the modernist tendency to experiment with form and structure.
This focus on subjectivity is a hallmark of modernist literature, which often seeks to depict the complexities of human consciousness.
