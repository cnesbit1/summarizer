Here are the definitions of the requested terms in genetics:

A dominant allele is one that expresses its trait even when only one copy is present.
In other words, if an individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele for a particular gene, the dominant allele will mask the effect of the recessive allele, and the trait associated with the dominant allele will be observed in the organism.
A recessive allele is one that expresses its trait only when two copies are present (i.e., in the absence of a dominant allele).
If an individual has one recessive allele and one dominant allele for a particular gene, the trait associated with the recessive allele will not be observed because the dominant allele will mask its effect.
The phenotype refers to the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism, as determined by both its genetic makeup and environmental influences.
Examples of phenotypes include height, eye color, and blood type.
An organism is homozygous for a gene if it has two identical alleles for that gene.
For example, if an individual has two dominant alleles (AA) or two recessive alleles (aa), they are considered homozygous for that gene.
An organism is heterozygous for a gene if it has two different alleles for that gene.
For example, if an individual has one dominant allele and one recessive allele (Aa), they are considered heterozygous for that gene.
Homologous chromosomes are pairs of chromosomes in a diploid organism that have the same structure and carry the same genes, but may carry different alleles.
One chromosome of each pair is inherited from each parent.
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains the necessary information to produce a functional product, typically a protein or RNA molecule.
Genes are the basic units of heredity and are passed from parents to offspring.
Alleles are different versions of a gene that arise through mutation and are found at the same place on a chromosome.
Different alleles can result in variations in the expressed trait.
The principle of independent assortment, proposed by Gregor Mendel, states that alleles for different genes segregate independently of one another during the formation of gametes.
This means the inheritance of one trait is not affected by the inheritance of another, provided the genes are on different chromosomes or far apart on the same chromosome.
The principle of segregation, also proposed by Gregor Mendel, states that during the formation of gametes, the two alleles for a gene separate, or segregate, so that each gamete carries only one allele for each gene.
This ensures that offspring inherit one allele from each parent.

Summary: 
One chromosome of each pair is inherited from each parent.
Different alleles can result in variations in the expressed trait.
An organism is heterozygous for a gene if it has two different alleles for that gene.
