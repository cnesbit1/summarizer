Original Response: 
The typical time complexity of a level order traversal of a binary tree using breadth-first search (BFS) is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
This is because BFS visits each node once.
The typical space complexity of a level order traversal using BFS is O(w), where w is the maximum width of the binary tree, i.e., the number of nodes in the widest level.
In the worst-case scenario, when the binary tree is a complete binary tree, the maximum width would be at the last level, which can have at most (n/2) nodes.
Therefore, the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.
In practice, if the binary tree is highly unbalanced or skewed, the space complexity might approach O(n) even earlier in the traversal process.
However, for a balanced binary tree, the space complexity would be closer to O(n) as the traversal progresses deeper into the tree.

Summary: 
This is because BFS visits each node once.
