It involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, which are pairs of chromosomes that have the same genes at the same loci but may carry different alleles. Here’s how crossing over works to \"unlink\" genes and what this means in terms of genetic inheritance:\n","\n","1. **Synapsis**: During prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair up closely in a process called synapsis.\n","2. **Formation of Chiasmata**: Chromatids of homologous chromosomes touch and exchange segments at points called chiasmata. These points of contact are where the physical exchange of chromosome segments occurs.\n","3. **Exchange of Genetic Material**: Sections of DNA are exchanged between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes. This reciprocal exchange is called homologous recombination or crossing over.\n","\n","- **Before Crossing Over**: Genes that are close to each other on the same chromosome (linked genes) tend to be inherited together because the probability of a crossover occurring between them is low.\n","- **After Crossing Over**: When a crossover event occurs between two linked genes, it can separate (unlink) these genes onto different chromatids, resulting in new combinations of alleles.\n","\n","- **Recombination**: Crossing over creates recombinant chromosomes that carry combinations of alleles not found in either parent. This increases genetic diversity in the offspring.\n","- **Unlinking of Genes**: When genes that were previously linked are separated by crossing over, they behave more like unlinked genes and assort independently, which aligns with Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment for genes on different chromosomes.\n","\n","Alfred Sturtevant, a student of Thomas Morgan, utilized the concept of recombination to create genetic maps:\n","- **Genetic Distance**: The frequency of crossing over between two genes is proportional to the physical distance between them on a chromosome. Genes that are far apart are more likely to be separated by crossing over than genes that are close together.\n","- **Map Units**: The distance between genes is measured in map units or centimorgans (cM). One map unit corresponds to a 1% recombination frequency.\n","\n","- **Linked Genes**: Genes located close to each other on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together.\n","- **Crossing Over**: During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA at chiasmata, which can separate linked genes and create new allele combinations.\n","- **Genetic Recombination**: This process results in recombinant chromosomes, increasing genetic diversity and allowing linked genes to be inherited independently in some cases.\n","\n","- **Linked genes** can become unlinked due to homologous recombination during meiosis, as described by Frans Janssen who observed chiasmata and the physical exchange of chromosome segments.\n","- **Genetic Maps**: Created by Alfred Sturtevant, these maps use recombination frequencies to determine the distances between genes on a chromosome, showing that genes far apart are more likely to undergo recombination.\n","\n","This detailed understanding of crossing over and genetic linkage provides insight into how genetic diversity is generated and how it fits within the broader framework of Mendelian genetics.\n","\n","Reference: [13.1B: Genetic Linkage and Distances - Biology LibreTexts](25)\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1mAssistant Code: 12\n","\u001b[0m\n","To distinguish between crossing over events that do not change linked genes and those that do, you need to analyze the resulting genetic combinations in the offspring.

Firstly, the story incorporates abrupt shifts, swiftly moving from one character's perspective to another without smooth transitions. For instance, in one scene, the focus abruptly shifts from Kirsha's thoughts to Salim Alwan's concerns about his business, creating a jarring transition (Chapter 4). This technique disrupts the narrative flow and contributes to a sense of disjunction and fragmentation.\n","\n","Additionally, the narrative employs discontinuous time, with frequent flashbacks and flash-forwards that disrupt the chronological order of events. For example, in Chapter 6, there is a flashback to Hamida's childhood, followed by a return to the present timeline. These temporal shifts fragment the storyline and challenge the reader's sense of coherence.\n","\n","The use of multiple points of view also adds to the fragmented nature of the narrative. Characters like Kirsha, Hamida, and Abbas narrate their experiences and viewpoints, offering disjointed glimpses into their lives. In Chapter 7, for instance, the narrative switches between different characters' perspectives, creating a mosaic of voices and viewpoints.\n","\n","Furthermore, the story features parallel plotlines that intersect and diverge, depicting the interconnected yet fragmented lives of the alley's inhabitants.

Through its fragmented narrative and shifting points of view, the novel suggests that truth is inherently subjective and dependent on individual perception. Each character in the alley has their own version of reality shaped by personal biases, desires, and experiences. For example, Kirsha's truth is influenced by his hedonistic lifestyle and disregard for societal norms, while Hamida's truth is shaped by her aspirations for a better life. Additionally, the novel highlights the relativity of truth through its portrayal of social dynamics and power structures within the alley. Characters like Abbas and Salim Alwan wield influence and authority, shaping the truth according to their own interests and agendas. Moreover, the narrative's use of metafiction further blurs the line between reality and fiction, calling into question the very nature of truth in storytelling. By presenting a fragmented and multifaceted portrayal of life in Midaq Alley, the novel suggests that truth is not a fixed entity but rather a subjective construct influenced by individual perspectives and experiences.\n","\n","\n","~~~~Pruning Text~~~~\n","\n","\n","\u001b[1mAssistant Code: 1\n","\u001b[0m\n","The typical time complexity of a level order traversal of a binary tree using breadth-first search (BFS) is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
