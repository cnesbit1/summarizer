Merge conflicts can also be challenging to resolve, especially in projects with multiple contributors.
Managing large repositories can also be difficult, as they can become unwieldy and difficult to navigate.
Additionally, Git is a distributed version control system, so users must be careful to properly manage their local and remote repositories.
