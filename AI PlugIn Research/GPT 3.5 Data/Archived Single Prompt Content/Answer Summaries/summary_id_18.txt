Original Response: 
No, not all planets reside inside a solar system.
Planets are celestial bodies that orbit stars, but there are also planets that do not orbit any star directly.
These are known as rogue planets or free-floating planets.
Rogue planets are thought to form in a similar way to other planets, but they are either ejected from their original solar systems due to gravitational interactions or formed without ever being gravitationally bound to a star.
These rogue planets wander through space without orbiting a star and can be challenging to detect directly since they do not emit light of their own and are not illuminated by a nearby star.
While rogue planets are relatively rare compared to planets within solar systems, they represent an intriguing population of objects that can provide insights into planet formation and the dynamics of stellar systems.

Summary: 
These are known as rogue planets or free-floating planets.
