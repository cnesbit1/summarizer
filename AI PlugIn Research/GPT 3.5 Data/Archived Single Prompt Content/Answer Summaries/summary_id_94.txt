Original Response: 
A volcano is a geological landform created by the eruption of magma from beneath the Earth's crust.
Here's how it forms: Magma Formation: Inside the Earth, below the crust, there's a layer called the mantle where rocks are so hot they melt into a molten rock called magma.
Pressure Build-Up: Magma is less dense than solid rock around it, so it rises toward the Earth's surface.
As it moves upward, it can collect in chambers below the surface.
Eruption: When the pressure from the accumulating magma becomes too great, it forces its way upward through vents or fractures in the Earth's crust.
This results in an eruption.
Volcanic Activity: During an eruption, magma, gases, and volcanic ash can be expelled onto the Earth's surface, forming a cone-shaped mountain over time.
This mountain is known as a volcano.
Volcanoes can vary greatly in size and shape depending on the type of magma, the frequency of eruptions, and other geological factors.
They are often found near the edges of tectonic plates or at hotspots within the Earth's crust.

Summary: 
This results in an eruption.
This mountain is known as a volcano.
As it moves upward, it can collect in chambers below the surface.
