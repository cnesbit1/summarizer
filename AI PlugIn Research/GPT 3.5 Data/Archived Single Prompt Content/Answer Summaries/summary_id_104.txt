When doing laundry, the temperature of water you use can impact how well clothes are cleaned and preserved.
Here are general guidelines for water temperatures based on different types of clothes: Hot Water (130°F/54.4°C to 140°F/60°C): Used For: White cotton and linens, heavily soiled items, and germ-killing disinfection.
Considerations: Hot water is effective in removing grease, oils, and tough stains but can cause colors to fade and shrink certain fabrics.
Warm Water (90°F/32.2°C to 110°F/43.3°C): Used For: Synthetic fibers, moderately soiled clothes, and colored garments that require a bit more cleaning power than cold water.
Considerations: Warm water helps dissolve detergents and can prevent shrinking and color fading better than hot water.
Cold Water (Below 80°F/26.7°C): Used For: Delicate fabrics, dark or bright colors, clothes that are not heavily soiled.
Considerations: Cold water is gentler on fabrics, helps prevent shrinking and color bleeding, and is energy-efficient.
It's suitable for most everyday laundry needs.
Always check the care label on your clothing for specific instructions regarding water temperature and other care recommendations.
Additionally, using the appropriate laundry detergent for the water temperature and type of fabric can help achieve optimal cleaning results while preserving your clothes.

Summary: 
It's suitable for most everyday laundry needs.
When doing laundry, the temperature of water you use can impact how well clothes are cleaned and preserved.
