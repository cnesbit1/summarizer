It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies Rules, Inc. (TSR), and is now published by Wizards of the Coast, a subsidiary of Hasbro.
D&D is considered the origin of modern role-playing games and has influenced a wide range of media and popular culture.
Basic Overview: Game Structure: Dungeon Master (DM): The game is led by the Dungeon Master, who creates and narrates the game's story, controls non-player characters (NPCs), and serves as the referee for the rules.
Players: Each player creates a character, known as a player character (PC), which they role-play throughout the game.
Players describe their character's actions and decisions.
Character Creation: Character Sheet: Players use a character sheet to track their character’s abilities, skills, equipment, and other attributes.
Classes and Races: Players choose a race (e.g., human, elf, dwarf) and a class (e.g., wizard, fighter, rogue) for their character, each providing unique abilities and traits.
Attributes: Characters have six core attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
These attributes affect their abilities and skills.
Gameplay: Role-Playing: Players describe their character’s actions, make decisions, and interact with the game world and other characters.
The DM narrates the outcomes of these actions.
Combat: Combat is a significant aspect of D&D, where players engage in battles with monsters and enemies.
Combat involves rolling dice to determine the outcome of attacks and actions.
Dice Rolling: The game uses polyhedral dice (commonly a set of seven dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) to determine the success or failure of actions based on character abilities and skills.
Adventures and Campaigns: Adventures: Pre-written or custom stories created by the DM that provide a structured narrative for the game.
Campaigns: A series of adventures linked together to form an ongoing story, often spanning multiple sessions and involving character progression.
Progression: Experience Points (XP): Characters earn XP by completing quests, defeating enemies, and solving problems.
XP is used to level up, improving abilities and gaining new skills.
Leveling Up: Characters increase in level, gaining new abilities, spells, and enhancements to attributes.
Key Components: Imagination and Storytelling: The core of D&D is the collaborative storytelling experience, where the DM and players create a shared narrative.
Strategic Thinking: Players must think strategically about their actions, both in and out of combat, to solve problems and advance the story.
