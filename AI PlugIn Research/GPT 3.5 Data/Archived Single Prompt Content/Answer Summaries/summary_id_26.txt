Space telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revolutionize our view of the universe by providing a clear and unobstructed view of celestial objects across different wavelengths of light, free from atmospheric distortion.
This allows astronomers to study the universe with unprecedented clarity and precision.
The Hubble Space Telescope, launched in 1990, has made numerous groundbreaking discoveries across various fields of astronomy.
It has helped to refine the age of the universe, observe distant galaxies and supernovae, study the formation of stars and planetary systems, and explore the properties of black holes and dark matter.
Hubble's observations have transformed our understanding of the cosmos and provided valuable data for countless scientific studies.
The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled for launch in 2022, is poised to build on Hubble's legacy and push the boundaries of astronomical research even further.
With its larger primary mirror and advanced infrared instruments, JWST will be capable of studying the earliest galaxies and stars, probing the atmospheres of exoplanets, and investigating the formation of galaxies and planetary systems in unprecedented detail.
It promises to revolutionize our understanding of the early universe and the processes that shaped it.
Overall, space telescopes like Hubble and JWST have enabled numerous scientific breakthroughs and have greatly expanded our knowledge of the cosmos, opening new frontiers in astronomy and astrophysics.

Summary: 
This allows astronomers to study the universe with unprecedented clarity and precision.
It promises to revolutionize our understanding of the early universe and the processes that shaped it.
