In Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), rolling for stats (also known as ability scores) is a crucial step in creating a character.
There are several methods to determine these scores, but the most common method is the "4d6 drop lowest" method.
Hereâ€™s how it works: Common Method: 4d6 Drop Lowest Roll Four Six-Sided Dice (4d6): Roll four six-sided dice.
Drop the Lowest Die: Discard the die with the lowest value.
Sum the Remaining Three Dice: Add up the values of the remaining three dice.
This total is the score for one of your six ability scores.
Repeat: Repeat this process five more times to generate scores for all six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma).
Example Roll 4d6: 5, 6, 2, 3 Drop the lowest: 2 Sum the remaining three: 5 + 6 + 3 = 14 Repeat for each ability score Other Methods Standard Array Use a pre-set array of scores: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.
Assign these scores to your abilities as you choose.
Point Buy Each ability score starts at 8.
You have a pool of points to spend to increase these scores.
Costs vary (e.g., increasing a score from 8 to 14 costs more points than from 8 to 10).
Rolling 3d6 Roll three six-sided dice (3d6) and sum them up for each ability score.
This can result in lower and more varied scores compared to the 4d6 drop lowest method.
Choosing a Method The method used is often determined by the Dungeon Master (DM) or agreed upon by the gaming group.
Each method has its own balance and flavor, from the randomness of rolling dice to the control of point buy.
Assigning Ability Scores After generating the six numbers, assign each to one of the six abilities (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) based on your character concept and class requirements.
Using these methods, players can create unique characters with strengths and weaknesses that add depth and personality to the game.

Summary: 
Assign these scores to your abilities as you choose.
This total is the score for one of your six ability scores.
Point Buy Each ability score starts at 8.
You have a pool of points to spend to increase these scores.
Rolling 3d6 Roll three six-sided dice (3d6) and sum them up for each ability score.
