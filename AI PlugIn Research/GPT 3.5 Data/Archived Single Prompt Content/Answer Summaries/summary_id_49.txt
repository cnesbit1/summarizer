Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, which can vary greatly in severity and presentation from person to person.
Common signs and symptoms of autism typically appear in early childhood and may include: Social Communication Challenges: Difficulty in understanding and using nonverbal communication cues such as gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice.
Delayed or limited use of spoken language, or lack of speech development altogether.
Difficulty initiating and maintaining conversations with others.
Challenges in understanding social norms and expectations in social interactions.
Social Interaction Difficulties: Difficulty forming and maintaining relationships with peers and adults.
Lack of interest in sharing enjoyment, interests, or achievements with others.
Preference for solitary activities and play, rather than engaging in social interactions.
Repetitive Behaviors and Restricted Interests: Engaging in repetitive movements such as rocking, spinning, or hand-flapping.
Insistence on sameness or routines, becoming upset by changes in routines.
Intense focus or preoccupation with specific topics or objects, often to the exclusion of other activities or interests.
Sensory Sensitivities: Sensitivity to sensory stimuli such as lights, sounds, textures, or smells.
Unusual reactions to sensory input, such as indifference to pain or temperature, or heightened sensitivity leading to distress.
Communication Challenges: Difficulty understanding and using language pragmatically, such as taking turns in conversation, understanding jokes, or interpreting sarcasm.
Literal understanding of language, leading to difficulties with figurative language or idioms.
Developmental Delays: Delayed development of motor skills, such as crawling, walking, or coordinated movements.
Delayed or atypical development of play skills, imaginative play, or understanding of social play rules.
It's important to note that individuals with autism spectrum disorder may display a combination of these symptoms to varying degrees.
Some individuals may have exceptional abilities or talents in specific areas, often referred to as "splinter skills" or "savant abilities," such as in music, art, mathematics, or memory.
Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes for individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
If you suspect that a child or someone you know may have autism, seeking a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional or developmental specialist is recommended for accurate diagnosis and appropriate support.
