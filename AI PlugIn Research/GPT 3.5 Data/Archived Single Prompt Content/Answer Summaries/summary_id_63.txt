Original Response: 
The theory of relativity refers to two distinct but related theories formulated by Albert Einstein: Special Theory of Relativity (1905): This theory fundamentally changed our understanding of space and time.
It posits that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other (hence, "relative" motion).
Key principles include: Constancy of the Speed of Light: The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or the observer.
Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer.
This effect becomes significant as objects approach the speed of light.
Length Contraction: Objects moving at high speeds appear contracted along the direction of motion when observed from a stationary position.
General Theory of Relativity (1915): This theory extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational phenomena.
Key concepts include: Curved Spacetime: Mass and energy curve spacetime, and objects move along curved paths (geodesics) dictated by this curvature.
Gravitational Time Dilation: Clocks closer to a massive object tick more slowly than clocks farther away due to the gravitational field.
Gravitational Redshift: Light emitted from a source in a strong gravitational field is redshifted (its wavelength increases) as it climbs out of the gravitational well.
The theory of relativity has been extensively tested and confirmed through various experiments and observations.
It forms the basis for our understanding of the universe on both small (subatomic) and large (cosmological) scales and has profound implications for physics, astronomy, and our overall worldview.

Summary: 
This effect becomes significant as objects approach the speed of light.
Time Dilation: Time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer.
