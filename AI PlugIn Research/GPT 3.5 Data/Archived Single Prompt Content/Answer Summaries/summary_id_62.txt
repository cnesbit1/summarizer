Update Software Regularly: Keep your operating system, browsers, and apps up to date to patch security vulnerabilities.
Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it harder for others to intercept your data.
Be Cautious with Public Wi-Fi: Avoid accessing sensitive information (like banking) over public Wi-Fi.
Use a VPN if you must connect to public networks.
Review Privacy Settings: Regularly check and adjust privacy settings on social media platforms and other online services to control what information is shared.
Limit Sharing Personal Information: Be mindful of what personal information you share online, especially on social media and forums.
