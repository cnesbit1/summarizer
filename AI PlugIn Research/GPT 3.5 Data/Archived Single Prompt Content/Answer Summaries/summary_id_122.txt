Original Response: 
Gorillas exhibit complex social behaviors when it comes to raising and caring for their young.
Hereâ€™s how they typically go about it: Maternal Care: Female gorillas are primarily responsible for caring for their offspring.
They nurse their babies for about three to four years, providing essential nutrition and bonding during this period.
Protection: Mother gorillas protect their young from potential threats, including predators and other gorillas.
They keep their infants close and teach them how to navigate their environment safely.
Socialization: Young gorillas learn social behaviors and skills through observation and interaction within their family groups.
They play with siblings and other young gorillas, developing important social bonds and learning hierarchy within the group.
Teaching: Older siblings, especially sisters, often play a role in caring for and teaching younger siblings.
They may help groom them, play with them, and provide additional protection.
Role of Silverbacks: Adult male gorillas, known as silverbacks, also play a protective role in the group.
While they are not directly involved in infant care, they provide overall group protection and stability, which benefits the young gorillas indirectly.
Weaning: Gorilla infants are weaned gradually over several years.
Initially, they transition from relying solely on their mother's milk to supplementing with solid food as they learn to forage.
This process helps them develop independence gradually.
Overall, gorillas exhibit strong familial bonds and cooperative behaviors within their social groups, which contribute to the successful raising and survival of their offspring in the wild.

Summary: 
Gorillas exhibit complex social behaviors when it comes to raising and caring for their young.
They may help groom them, play with them, and provide additional protection.
Weaning: Gorilla infants are weaned gradually over several years.
This process helps them develop independence gradually.
