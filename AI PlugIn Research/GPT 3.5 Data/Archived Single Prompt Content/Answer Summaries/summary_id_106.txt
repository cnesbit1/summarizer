To avoid shrinking clothes when drying them, here are some best practices you can follow: Read Care Labels: Always check the care labels on your clothing for specific drying instructions.
Some fabrics are more prone to shrinking and require special care.
Air Dry: The safest method to prevent shrinking is to air dry your clothes.
Here's how: Hanging: Hang clothes on a drying rack or clothesline to air dry naturally.
Flat Drying: Lay delicate items flat on a clean towel or mesh rack to dry.
Low Heat Setting: If you prefer to use a dryer, select the lowest heat setting possible.
Here are some tips: Permanent Press Setting: Use the permanent press setting on your dryer, which typically uses lower heat and a cool-down cycle to minimize wrinkles and shrinking.
Avoid High Heat: High heat can cause fabrics to shrink more quickly.
Reserve high heat settings for towels, sheets, and cotton fabrics that can withstand it.
Remove Promptly: Remove clothes from the dryer as soon as they are dry to prevent any residual heat from causing shrinking or wrinkles.
Avoid Overloading: Overloading the dryer can lead to uneven drying and increase the likelihood of clothes shrinking.
Use Dryer Balls or Tennis Balls: Adding dryer balls or tennis balls to the dryer can help fluff and separate clothes, reducing drying time and minimizing shrinkage.
Reshape When Damp: If garments are slightly damp after drying, reshape them gently by stretching or smoothing out wrinkles before air drying completely.
By following these guidelines, you can help preserve the size and shape of your clothes while ensuring they dry effectively and safely.
