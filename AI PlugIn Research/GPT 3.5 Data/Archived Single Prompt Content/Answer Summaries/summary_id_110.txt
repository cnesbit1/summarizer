Tennis scoring can seem a bit complex at first, but it follows a structured system that determines the outcome of each game, set, and match.
Hereâ€™s how the scoring system works in tennis: Scoring in a Game: Points: A game is made up of a series of points.
Points are counted as follows: 0 points: "Love" (pronounced as "zero" in some regions) 1 point: "15" 2 points: "30" 3 points: "40" If both players or teams have won three points each (40-40), it's called "Deuce."
Advantage: To win a game from deuce, a player or team must score two consecutive points.
The first point won after deuce is called "Advantage [player/team]."
If the player or team with advantage wins the next point, they win the game.
If they lose the point, the score returns to deuce.
Game: To win a game, a player or team must win four points and have at least a two-point lead over their opponent.
For example, winning a point from 40-30 would win the game, as would winning both points after deuce.
Scoring in a Set: Sets: Matches are typically best of three sets (for women's matches and early rounds of men's matches) or best of five sets (for men's matches and later rounds of women's matches).
Games in a Set: To win a set, a player or team must win at least six games and have a two-game lead over their opponent.
If the set reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is usually played.
Tiebreaker: Tiebreaker: A tiebreaker is played to decide a set that reaches 6-6.
In a tiebreaker, points are scored as "1," "2," "3," etc., and players or teams alternate serving every two points (the first server serves once, then the second server serves twice, and so on).
Winning a Tiebreaker: To win a tiebreaker, a player or team must reach at least seven points and have a two-point lead over their opponent.
For example, winning a tiebreaker 7-5 or 10-8 would win the set.
Scoring in a Match: Matches: To win a match, a player or team must win the predetermined number of sets (best of three or best of five).
Match Tiebreaker (Super Tiebreaker): In some formats, a match tiebreaker (often called a super tiebreaker or third-set tiebreaker) is played instead of a third set.
This tiebreaker is similar to a regular tiebreaker but played to 10 points with a two-point lead.
Example: If a match is best of three sets and Player A wins the first two sets 6-3, 6-4, they win the match.
If a match is best of five sets and Player B wins the first three sets 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 7-5, they win the match.
Understanding the scoring system in tennis helps players and fans follow the progression of matches and determine the winner based on the rules of points, games, sets, and matches.

Summary: 
If they lose the point, the score returns to deuce.
If the player or team with advantage wins the next point, they win the game.
If the set reaches 6-6, a tiebreaker is usually played.
The first point won after deuce is called "Advantage [player/team]."
For example, winning a tiebreaker 7-5 or 10-8 would win the set.
Tiebreaker: Tiebreaker: A tiebreaker is played to decide a set that reaches 6-6.
