Original Response: 
Pyroclastic flows, lava flows, and ash clouds are different phenomena associated with volcanic eruptions, each with distinct characteristics and impacts: Pyroclastic Flows: Definition: Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving currents of hot gas, ash, and volcanic rock fragments that travel down the slopes of a volcano at extremely high speeds, often exceeding 100 km/h (60 mph).
Composition: They consist of a dense mixture of volcanic material, including ash, pumice, and hot gases (such as sulfur dioxide).
Formation: Pyroclastic flows typically form during explosive volcanic eruptions when large amounts of gas and volcanic material are ejected from the volcano's vent.
The collapse of eruption columns or the explosive fragmentation of lava domes can generate pyroclastic flows.
Destructive Power: Pyroclastic flows can devastate everything in their path, incinerating vegetation, buildings, and infrastructure.
They are one of the most lethal volcanic hazards due to their high temperatures (up to 1,000째C or 1,800째F) and speed.
Lava Flows: Definition: Lava flows are streams of molten rock (lava) that move across the Earth's surface during volcanic eruptions.
Composition: Lava is typically composed of molten silicate minerals, primarily basaltic or andesitic in composition.
Types: Lava flows can vary in viscosity (fluidity) and speed.
Some lava flows move slowly, allowing people to escape, while others can move rapidly, posing significant hazards.
Impact: Lava flows can destroy vegetation, buildings, and infrastructure in their path, altering landscapes and habitats.
They can also create new landforms, such as lava plateaus and volcanic cones.
Ash Clouds: Definition: Ash clouds consist of fine particles of volcanic ash and rock fragments that are ejected into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.
Composition: Ash particles are typically less than 2 mm (0.08 inches) in diameter and can remain suspended in the atmosphere for days to weeks, depending on wind patterns.
Distribution: Ash clouds can spread over large areas, carried by wind currents, and can affect air travel by posing hazards to aircraft engines and visibility.
Impact: Ashfall from volcanic eruptions can contaminate water supplies, disrupt agriculture, and pose health risks due to respiratory problems and eye irritation.
Heavy ashfall can collapse roofs and cause structural damage to buildings.
These phenomena highlight the diverse and potentially hazardous impacts of volcanic eruptions on landscapes, ecosystems, and human communities.
Monitoring and understanding these volcanic hazards are essential for mitigating risks and ensuring the safety and resilience of populations living near volcanically active areas.

Summary: 
Types: Lava flows can vary in viscosity (fluidity) and speed.
