Understanding the differences between natural sugars and added sugars is important for making informed dietary choices.
Hereâ€™s an overview of each type: Natural Sugars: Occurrence: Natural sugars occur naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.
Types: Fructose: Found in fruits, honey, and some vegetables.
Glucose: Present in fruits, vegetables, and honey; it's a primary source of energy for the body.
Lactose: Found in milk and dairy products.
Nutritional Context: Natural sugars are typically accompanied by other nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which contribute to overall nutritional value.
For example, fruits contain fiber that slows down sugar absorption, reducing its impact on blood sugar levels compared to refined sugars.
Health Considerations: Consuming natural sugars as part of whole foods is generally considered healthier than consuming added sugars.
Whole fruits, for instance, provide essential nutrients and fiber, which contribute to satiety and overall health benefits.
Added Sugars: Definition: Added sugars are sugars and syrups added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation.
Sources: High-Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS), Sucrose (table sugar), Honey, Agave Nectar, and other sweeteners are examples of added sugars.
Added sugars are found in processed foods such as candies, baked goods, sugary drinks, and desserts.
Nutritional Context: Added sugars provide calories but typically lack essential nutrients like fiber, vitamins, and minerals.
They contribute to the sweetness of foods and beverages but do not offer the same nutritional benefits as natural sugars found in whole foods.
Health Considerations: Excessive consumption of added sugars has been linked to various health issues, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and dental cavities.
The American Heart Association recommends limiting added sugar intake to no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams) per day for women and 9 teaspoons (38 grams) per day for men.
Differentiating Between Natural and Added Sugars: Label Reading: Check food labels for ingredients like sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, agave nectar, and others to identify added sugars.
Whole Foods: Choose whole foods that contain natural sugars, such as fruits, vegetables, and dairy products, which provide essential nutrients and fiber.
Moderation: Enjoy natural sugars from whole foods in moderation as part of a balanced diet.
Limit consumption of foods and beverages high in added sugars to promote overall health and well-being.
By being aware of the sources and effects of natural and added sugars, you can make healthier choices that support your nutritional needs and wellness goals.

Summary: 
Types: Fructose: Found in fruits, honey, and some vegetables.
Lactose: Found in milk and dairy products.
Added Sugars: Definition: Added sugars are sugars and syrups added to foods and beverages during processing or preparation.
Whole fruits, for instance, provide essential nutrients and fiber, which contribute to satiety and overall health benefits.
Understanding the differences between natural sugars and added sugars is important for making informed dietary choices.
Glucose: Present in fruits, vegetables, and honey; it's a primary source of energy for the body.
