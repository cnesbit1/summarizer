Original Response: 
A volcano erupts due to the buildup of pressure from molten rock (magma) beneath the Earth's surface.
Several factors contribute to the eruption process: Magma Formation and Ascent: Magma forms in the Earth's mantle due to the melting of rock caused by heat and pressure.
As magma is less dense than surrounding solid rock, it rises toward the Earth's surface through cracks and fractures.
Gas Content: Magma contains dissolved gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.
As magma rises, the decrease in pressure causes these gases to exsolve (come out of solution) and accumulate, increasing pressure within the magma chamber.
Crystallization and Differentiation: As magma ascends, it can cool and crystallize, which changes its composition and viscosity.
More viscous magma tends to trap gases more effectively, leading to explosive eruptions.
Pressure Build-Up: The accumulation of magma beneath the surface creates pressure on the overlying rock.
When this pressure becomes too great, it can fracture the rock, allowing magma to erupt explosively or effusively (in the form of lava flows).
External Triggers: External factors such as tectonic activity (like plate movements), earthquakes, or human-induced activities (such as drilling or mining) can also trigger volcanic eruptions by altering the pressure conditions within magma chambers or causing structural changes.
When the pressure from the ascending magma exceeds the strength of the surrounding rocks, an eruption occurs, expelling magma, gases, ash, and volcanic rocks onto the Earth's surface or into the atmosphere.
The type of eruption (explosive or effusive) depends on factors like magma composition, gas content, and the presence of water or other volatiles.

Summary: 
Pressure Build-Up: The accumulation of magma beneath the surface creates pressure on the overlying rock.
