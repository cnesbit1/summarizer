had a single problem with my switches.\n","I appreciate the ability to do this.\n","It works great as is.\n","Unmanaged/\"smart\" so I can just plug and go.\n","I used it as a regular switch and it functioned well on all ports.\n","I replaced an older smaller Netgear switch.\n","I have been using Netgear unmanaged switches for many years.\n","It's also a pretty nice switch.\n","I mounted this in a media cabinet.\n","Netgear 24 Port  Switch @ a great price.\n","This switch is another great NetGear product.\n","This is a basic 5-port network switch.\n","I say this because it hangs off your router.\n","I love the USB charging!\n","The lights worked, but I couldn't get through.\n","This switch does not require an IP address of its own.\n","I like that I can log into the switch itself and not have any installed software.\n","For the price these switches work great.\n","Use:\n","I work with a lot of small offices.\n","Exactly what I would expect from Netgear.\n","4) Connect the power supply to the NETGEAR switch and plug it in.\n","Previously I had reviewed the NETGEAR GC110 Managed Switch.\n","So, if that is important to you, then this might be the switch for you.\n","It has some features and a price that makes it more than just a dumb switch.\n","So in the most part I would use this as just a plug-and-play switch.\n","There is much to like about the NETGEAR GS908 switch.\n","This is the first switch I have used that has software that can control some of its features.\n","The switch seems to be larger for the cable management feature.\n","If you need more than 8 ports, it's also great switch.\n","So I ran the test.\n","(This is a review of the 8-port unmanaged switch).\n","I did not perform any performance measurements.\n","It was easy to mount and setup.\n","This one is no exception.\n","The switch hardware:\n","It's a pretty heavy switch.\n","Based on my experience with Netgear, I do not expect to have any issues with this switch.\n","Netgear makes great stuff and this switch is no exception.\n","It has a few more features, but loses the USB ports.\n","Like most switches, it is easy to connect and set up, and it works great.\n","It was easy to mount and all the ports are working fine.\n","I did try the netgear software and it found my switch just fine.\n","It is only USB charging.\n","I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years.\n","I think it's a great switch for a conference room table.\n","It will not connect usb to computers.\n","To those who are new to switches they are the easiest device to use.\n","This switch looks incredible, and has some advanced features.\n","I also applaud Netgears lifetime warranty.\n","I've used their products for years and am happy with this switch.\n","I also like that it came in white.\n","As I tested, I plugged it in and it worked great.\n","Wow, what a solidly built switch.\n","It is working well and it is very easy to set up and use.\n","I like that it has no fan in it as it is quiet in my office.\n","The fact that all the ports are to the rear is very nice.\n","I also like that the casing for this switch is metal rather than plastic.\n","The GC110 switch has a metal (likely aluminum) case.\n","I have one of the older generation and it works well.\n","Something I find a very desirable feature.\n","I don't have any issues with it, and I would suggest it.\n","I have a wired and wireless network in my home like most people.\n","For home and gaming use, this switch is really nice.\n","I like it and I rated it at 5 stars.\n","You can't go wrong with this switch.\n","The ability to turn ports off... prob.\n","It is like one of those power strips for your internet.\n","This is the way to go.\n","I have had multiple nether switches over the years and they have all performed flawlessly.\n","It also has a Kensington lock port.\n","It comes with Windows software, which I have not used so far.\n","I also renamed all the ports, with names such as AppleTV.\n","The switch hardware:\n","Unlike the 16 port, this is a light plastic switch.\n","The slots for the ethernet cables are too narrow.\n","There is even a switch to turn off the port lights if you wish.\n","I currently installed the switch in the another room that I have been using a 10/100 switch.\n","(It can not be rack mounted, however.)\n","I like the new click mounting plate system.\n","This one is good for the money.\n","Also, the GC110 is a managed switch while the GS908 is an unmanaged switch.\n","This is a rock solid, heavy metal switch from Netgear.\n","\n","Abstractor Using extPercent\n","\n","\n","Final Result, using 269 words:\n","\n","This review is for the NETGEAR GS308 Switch.\n","It is the first switch I have seen that is more

this have to do with this Netgear Gigabit Switch?\n","The Netgear Gigabit Switch can take it.\n","But this switch is very expensive.\n","Concusion:\n","It's a nice switch.\n","This is exactly what I needed.\n","This 8 port switch is no exception.\n","I could not recommend it more.\n","I like the usb charging ports.\n","This is really where this switch shines.\n","I know it will hold up.\n","So I find no fault with this switch at all.\n","I used it to hard wire all my devices.\n","This review is for the NETGEAR GS308 Switch.\n","the first switch I have seen that is more than just function.\n","Features: Switch to turn LED off and on.\n","I have never had a single problem with my switches.\n","I appreciate the ability to do this.\n","It works great as is.\n","Unmanaged/\"smart\" so I can just plug and go.\n","I used it as a regular switch and it functioned well on all ports.\n","I replaced an older smaller Netgear switch.\n","I have been using Netgear unmanaged switches for many years.\n","It's also a pretty nice switch.\n","I mounted this in a media cabinet.\n","Netgear 24 Port  Switch @ a great price.\n","This switch is another great

this as just a plug-and-play switch.\n","There is much to like about the NETGEAR GS908 switch.\n","This is the first switch I have used that has software that can control some of its features.\n","The switch seems to be larger for the cable management feature.\n","If you need more than 8 ports, it's also great switch.\n","So I ran the test.\n","(This is a review of the 8-port unmanaged

experience with Netgear, I do not expect to have any issues with this switch.\n","Netgear makes great stuff and this switch is no exception.\n","It has a few more features, but loses the USB ports.\n","Like most switches, it is easy to connect and set up, and it works great.\n","It was easy to mount and all the ports are working fine.\n","I did try the netgear software and it found my switch just fine.\n","It is only USB charging.\n","I had moved away from Netgear switches in recent years.\n","I think it's a great switch for a conference room table.\n","It will not connect usb to computers.\n","To those who are new to switches they are the easiest device to use.\n","This switch looks incredible, and has some advanced features.\n","I also applaud Netgears lifetime warranty.\n","I've used their products for years and am happy with this switch.\n","I also like that it came in white.\n","As I tested, I plugged it in and it worked great.\n","Wow, what a solidly built switch.\n","It is working well and it is very easy to set up and use.\n","I like that it has no fan in it as it is quiet in my office.\n","The fact that all the ports are to the rear is very nice.\n","I also like that the casing for this switch is metal rather than plastic.\n","The GC110 switch has a metal (likely aluminum) case.\n","I have one of the older generation and it works well.\n","Something I find a very desirable feature.\n","I don't have any issues with it, and I would suggest it.\n","I have a wired and wireless network in my home like most people.\n","For home and gaming use, this switch is really nice.\n","I like it and I rated it at 5 stars.\n","You can't go wrong with this switch.\n","The ability to turn ports off... prob.\n","It is like one of those power strips for your internet.\n","This is the way to go.\n","I have had multiple nether switches over the years and they have all performed flawlessly.\n","It also has a Kensington lock port.\n","It comes with Windows software, which I have not used so far.\n","I also renamed all the ports, with names such as AppleTV.\n","The switch hardware:\n","Unlike the 16 port, this is a light plastic switch.\n","The slots for the ethernet cables are too narrow.\n","There is even a switch to turn off the port lights if you wish.\n","I currently installed the switch in the another room that I have been using a 10/100 switch.\n","(It can not be rack mounted, however.)\n","I like the new click mounting plate system.\n","This one is good for the money.\n","Also, the GC110 is a managed switch while
