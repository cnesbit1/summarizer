I like how portable it is.
I need to get out and use it more.
I bought this for a gift.
This is a nice fishing set.
It is a good combo.
I was impressed with the quality for the price!
The reel is loud but it works.
I really enjoyed this product.
so i still have the rod i guess?
I like the included carrying bag for the rod.
Rod is hard, so big fish can be caught.
Will update as I get more use out of it.
The reel seems to be okay.
The rod is a piece of junk.
I did not encounter any issues while inspecting and using this fishing rod.
I wanted to put some time in with this rod and reel combo.
This pole is nice and compact.
Great one to have, this is my favorite fishing rod and reel I ever had!
This review is for the LineRike fishing pole.
I felt for the price it was a good value.
I bought two, both were broken.
I got this for Fatherâ€™s Day and it is a very nice rod.
First cast the reel broke.
Easy setup and casts and reels well.
Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.
I don't know much about fishing, but seems good to me.
Good buy for your money.
I wouldn't mind getting one for myself.
I spent more time untangling the line than I did fishing with it.
No fishing pole the rest of the time.
It s nice little setup.
I will buy another just not this brand.
Reel looks very high quality.
Light weight and easy to use.
