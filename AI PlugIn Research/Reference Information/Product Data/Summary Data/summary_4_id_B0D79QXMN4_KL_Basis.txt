the bike is good for the price.
The bike was all there and very easy to assemble.
Bike trails here I come!!!
Also, the bike seat is very hard.
In all, it's a great bike!
I am not getting assemble tools.
I did buy a different seat for it.
I did raise the seat a bit .
All in all a nice riding bike.
Payed more than Walmart bike.
Now I have to return it?
This bike is great quality.
It’s a great bike but the seat is uncomfortable.
It was easy to assemble.
The bike is fairly nice for the price.
I'll be buying a bike seat cushion for it.
But again, bike seat is pretty tall.
Its a good bike for price but not easy to assemble.
I may as well buy a new bike.
Otherwise its a great bike in budget.
Got this bike for my teen son.
Got this bike for 14-year-old son.
Every part of this bike is cheap.
This bike is a no-brainer at this price.
Hard to assemble but he loved it.
It was very well assembled.
Nice bike, but not happy about the scratches.
This bike is very nice, I am 5'6" and it's perfect .
It was a great buy.
This bike arrived with a broken bike seat.
I just got back from a pain ride due to seat!
I'm not too happy with the front brake.
The tires are the right size for suburban biking.
That’s why I can’t assemble it properly.
The only issue I had was that the instructions were hard to understand.
The bike is very easy to assemble, even for a bike newbie like me.
