It took a full grown man me to slam down on the front forks shocks to free them up. Por manufacturing junk internal parts cheap Chinese junck!.

The general comfort and feel of the bike isn't great. The seat is not all that great, the handlebar grips are a little small, and you tend to feel every little bump and vibration despite having a ""front suspension."" I also had trouble with gears skipping and even the local bike mechanic could only improve it a little. Then there's the brakes, they are not very reliable. Even after tightening them, they lose performance over just a few miles. The worst part was that, I'm guessing due to the cheap material, one pedal actually ruined the socket. When I looked, the pedal bolt was fine, but the socket was completely wrecked. The pedal came off a couple of miles from home and I had to walk back.

Ok I’m up for a challenge, maybe I missed a step in assembly and walked the bike back to evaluate. Once back I confirmed no steps were missed and got the bike going and still persisted to have chain issues. The final straw was turning and pedaling or lack there of.

Not a big deal, but annoying for a brand new item. We read all of the instructions and it still took a day and a half to completely get it ready to ride. The front brakes were installed crooked so they rubbed the tire, and the cables had to be taken apart to get the brakes to function correctly. The cable going to one of the handlebars wasn't even attached so one of our friends had to take it apart to fix that. If we didn't have a large selection of tools and handy friends, we would have never gotten this thing safe to ride for our son. Crappy quality and would not recommend.","Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2021","Color: Red<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Size: 24-inch","Verified Purchase","3 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

While there they pointed out that both tire rims were bad, the back inner tube wasn’t holding air and the chain mechanism on the back tire is bent! Poor quality and who ever put it together didn’t know what they doing!
