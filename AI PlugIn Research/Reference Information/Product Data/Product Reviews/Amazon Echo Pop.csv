The color matches my cabinet pretty well.  I liked how easy they were to set up and even pair together.  Other versions of these gave me a little more hassle to set up as a pair, but not these! The sound is really good given their size and configuration.  I'm really impressed, plus they're compact.  Just wish the cords had an option to be longer or order a longer version.  Seems like they really had these in mind for a kitchen setup as the cords wouldn't really work even for a standard floor outlet setup.  I'm just lucky that my tool cabinet has a power strip built in, so the cord is just long enough to work for what I wanted.<br>Given the size and the cost, especially on sale, these are a great value for the money.  Plus if you have Alexa in other parts of your house, they seem to have figured out the setup to integrate into an existing system.  And if these will be your first, they are really easy to get going.","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024","Color: Midnight Teal<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","19 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

We now have an Alexa for each bedroom that is connected to the bedroom lights for easy voice activated on and off features. Makes lighting the darkness very easy and user friendly. The device does an excellent job at recognizing different levels of voices and knows very well which device you are talking to. This Alexa Pop also has pretty decent speaker abilities for playing music.

"R3DT0XP2KQQV51","Geodenizen","https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEVYRJ22RJEKNGP2TAQIBRNU5CPA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8","4","","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DT0XP2KQQV51/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09ZXJDSL5","B09ZXJDSL5","The Amazon Echo Pop was my first experience with an Alexa device, and I could kick myself for not buying 2 of these at the sale price of just under $23. At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.<br><br>Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said “Alexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.” It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn’t necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn’t going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.<br><br>That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can’t function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn’t have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.<br><br>Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren’t exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.<br><br>I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.<br><br>One other issue is with the alarm level. I can’t seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it’s time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.<br><br>Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as “Peaceful Current Radio,” or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.<br><br>Update:<br>I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can’t match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I’m considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.<br><br>Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can’t find that in my Apple music library.<br><br>I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:<br>Peaceful current Radio<br>New Standard WNYC<br>IPR Studio 1<br>KTUX FM<br>KSRY FM<br>WJIB FM<br>Café Del Mar Radio<br>Americana Boogey Radio<br>Aloha Joe<br>Quiet Village Radio<br>WSBZ FM<br>Smooth Jazz 101<br>WABE Classical<br><br>Just ask Alexa to play any of these, and get ready for a treat.","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","Color: Glacier White<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","56 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

It was super easy to set up with the Alexa app since I have another, it only took 2 minutes to set up. I haven't had any issues so far. We use this one in the bedroom for alarms, music, and to turn off the smart lights in the house when going to bed. I like that this one doesn't have a camera or the screens that's constantly showing amazon ads, our other one is basically a shopping billboard so we shoved it into a storm trooper helmet and named her Kevin... who needs the screens anyway? With the screen, I guess you can do the family photo display, but it still is at least 60% ads instead of a digital photo display like I was promised. They advertise the screened Echos with things like 'oh you can watch cooking videos and the news and do a family photo screen saver"" but that is what I have a phone for, if I need to watch something I'm more likely to use a TV or a laptop or even an iPad or my phone, the Echo is a last resort that will never happen. My phone has an easier interface, and its own AI assistant. Theyre also like ""you can video chat your amazon contacts"" but amazon is not social media, I'm not gonna collect amazon contacts and video chat them, and have yall head or facetime,,, or a phone?? Like no thank you, the screen on these things is just annoying and not aesthetically pleasing with all the weird ads that it didn't used to have, I never even see the screensaver with the time showing in forever and can't change the settings because amazon wants it to be a billboard. I really liked the screen when it used to be the time and I could use it as a clock, but no longer, that was the only thing I liked on the screen. Get the Pop instead, it's cheaper and wildly better. All the extra features they offer you for other models are a scam and you'll never use them, the Pop is great. I wish they'd bring back the panda face version, that one was cute.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2024","Color: Glacier White<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","12 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

Bought it absolutely occasionally while browsing the Amazon. I was actually looking for some kind of gift ideas for my almost 9 years old daughter (she was always so excited to visit our friends and neighbors and talk to Alexa lol). And the $19 offer popped up in my screen for this little device (refurbished). I decided to give it a try. In the next day or two a $14 offer for a brand new one popped up and of course I bought it right away. My daughter’s birthday is in few days but I couldn’t wait myself to try it so I decided to give this present to her yesterday saying she will have tons of gifts on her actual birthday date anyway. You should’ve seen her happy face! It’s just unbelievable! Did not have much time to set it up yesterday, was afraid if something goes wrong I could become confused and just forget this idea of having Alexa at home which will make my daughter to feel upset. So started today. Now I see I should’ve started it yesterday. Gosh, whole initial setup took less than 5 minutes including unpacking and pairing with the app. Alexa momentarily was ready to listen. As you can see on my video I just asked some simple questions to perform the test. And despite my accent (english is not my native language) I’ve got very clear answers. Amazing! Of course and as always while buying something I’ve got through some negative reviews. A number of people say the sound quality is below their expectations. Really? Do you really expect a 12 inches Bose quality sound for $14? In my honest opinion for such a compact speaker the sound quality is a way above the average. It doesn’t just sound great for such a compact size but it also very loud and clear. I measured the device - it’s only 4 inches in diameter and I’m pretty sure the actual speaker itself is even smaller (but can’t confirm because it’s not visible from outside). Some people say they can’t get it to work at all, numerous say it’s doesn’t do anything right unless you buy something, some find another negative reasons. I do not know and have no clue what they are talking about. It works seamlessly!  For now, as a beginner, I love all the features it offers, for example I don’t have to look for a button to turn the alarm off, I just touched it somewhere and alarm stopped (couple of minutes later I realized it was a snooze mode so I actually asked Alexa to stop the alarm (just the alarm clock itself could cost me more than this speaker by the way)). Really love a whisper feature. If you whisper Alexa will whisper back - wow!  Isn’t it great if everyone else is sleeping in your house, for example?! Real time news, weather, music, reminders, alarms and many many more to discover. I feel like we have a new family member and some genius companion at home lol. I’m truly admired and amazed by all this new  technologies. Special thanks to designers for a different color choice. I would choose black or white, my wife - purple, but my daughters favorite color is green so she got a right one. Now I am finishing to write this long review and start integrating all my smart cameras and devices with our new companion - was always wondering all those devices saying “Compatible with Alexa” on a box. So it’s time to try! Of course if something goes wrong I will update my review here and maybe join the group of negative reviewers but something tells me it’s not going to happen. Usually my first impression stays with me forever. But we will see. For now this little companion honestly deserves its 5 stars. Hope someone will find my review helpful.","Reviewed in the United States on May 28, 2024","Color: Midnight Teal<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","60 people found this helpful","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/feee06b2-e983-48e0-ab98-4ef3f391e23c/default.vertical.jobtemplate.mp4.480.mp4","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71P-1TmFbvL._SY256._SY256.jpg","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V+4eRg4eL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fr0LO0HxL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wGIwuezvL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715iZWyRHYL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iGgstrahL._SY88.jpg""]","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V+4eRg4eL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fr0LO0HxL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61wGIwuezvL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715iZWyRHYL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iGgstrahL.jpg""]"

I haven't explored probably 80% of what this thing can do, and I likely will not (see the instrusive comment above.)

I then left feedback directly through my Alexa echo that was just about as nasty.  A support rep reached out by phone the next day as a result and then sent me an email with instructions how to resolve problem below.  I should have just asked for help before losing it lol.  But thin skin these days like a lot of us dealing with issues in world right now.  Anyway problem is fixed and wanted to give a big shout out to the support team for their quick help and having to deal with me! 😌<br><br>Orig Feedback<br>At some point I had about 50 different devices associated with insteon.  That company went out of business and then came back but logins don't work anymore etc...  I made the unfortunate mistake sometime back of linking Alexa to insteon.  Alexa is too stupid to completely unlink from the app on their end.  I can delete one by one each of the 50 devices but every time I want to add a new device it auto discovers all of them again.  And then tells me to fully unlink I need to also go to the manufacturer site which is not possible.  Without being able to go back to the manufacturer insteon and complete the unlinking from there side they will never go away.  This is making the experience, the management of devices, and the display of devices a big sloppy mess for my end.  Used to be a website associated with Alexa but that's also gone.  And clearly the app is only there for the most basic scenarios.  So if you want to avoid my mistake it's simple don't buy Alexa.  It's one of those situations where it works great until it absolutely takes a nosedive and doesn't for ever more.  Probably has a lot to do with layoffs and lack of investments in this area which I heard is going the wrong direction AKA downhill for Alexa.  I guess if people want it to turn on their Philips colored light in their bedroom more power to you.  But if you want to use it as a more serious home automation tool ,whole house, then understand this type of limitation is devastating.  Even my Google devices can be permanently unlinked without me having to go back to the manufacturer.  But I've come to hate Google for similar reasons because they also are de-investing and now I have to deal with other problems including saying hey Google multiple times before it actually responds.  So disappointed in these companies and this field of work.  They both promised so much for the next decade and have woefully undelivered on those promises.  Guess I will wait until a more AI capable unit becomes affordable because they are out there but not yet mainstream enough.  Good luck everyone.","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2024","Color: Charcoal<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","17 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

ROME ... BUCHAREST ... and as long as the atmosphere and the authorities cooperated, you could always find something to listen to. After immigrating to the US he recreated that experience with a shortwave radio and then a succession of internet radios, but now his gear is breaking or being bricked at just the point in his life when he can't seek out repairs or workarounds.

This is my first experience with a smart speaker too and I'm a little perplexed that the voice commands are less AI-y than one might have expected. I think you need to utter a precise phrase in order to bring in a radio station. For example, ""Alexa, play Australian Broadcasting Corporation Classical"" won't work; it has to be ""Alexa, play ABC Classic One"" or ""Alexa, play ABC Classic Two.""  And listening to the CBC involved verbally navigating a hierarchy that I can't quite remember now, but it makes the difference between pulling in a local on-air station or a national internet station. This may have something to do with ""Alexa skills,"" which I haven't fully comprehended yet. Is, for example, CBC a ""skill"" and the CBC's various feeds fall beneath this skill? And if so, what is the correct way to activate them?<br><br>So, I have some learning to do, but in the meantime the Pop has been a smashing success in bringing music back into my father's house.","Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2024","Color: Charcoal<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","11 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I decided to try it since it was offered for only $17.99 and if my wi-fi reached my garage from my house, it was worth the gamble. (The price is now about $40) I was very surprised at just how great the sound was from such a small speaker. I have the original ""hockey puck"" Echo Dot in my kitchen that I use exclusively for my Amazon microwave oven and the Amazon wall clock but knowing just how terrible the sound is from that, I figured the Pop can't be worse. I also did not want to use one of my two original Echo Plus speakers (the tall ones they no longer offer, I wish Amazon would stop discontinuing items so frequently) nor did I want to pay for another Echo Studio since it is a garage with no heat or A/C (I am in Florida). The Pop does not sound as great as my Echo Studio but it is better than the original Echo Plus units that do sound very nice. It was well worth the very inexpensive price. I placed it on my tool box. The only drawback is it needs to be plugged in. A rechargeable internal battery would have convinced me to give it 5 stars. I also chose the lavender color since I did want it to be easily noticeable wherever I placed it (I am tired of black and white electronics). The Pop itself has a flat spot on the bottom that works just fine to place it anywhere. It also understands my commands easily with a mic that can be switched off using a button on the top. At the current price of $40 I would probably hesitate on the purchase. However, you will be satisfied at the performance of these whether you paid what I did or at the current price.","Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2024","Color: Lavender Bloom<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Configuration: Device only","Verified Purchase","74 people found this helpful","","","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f4UKroFYL._SY88.jpg""]","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81f4UKroFYL.jpg""]"
