This is by far the best inexpensive vac I have ever used and far outperforms more expensive ones. The extra bonus for me is how easy it is to clean the dirt chamber. Keeping that clean reduces blow back tremendously. So, unless you are looking for a HEPA vac, this is the way to go. The only downside is that it is corded vs. battery operated, but that is a small price to pay at this price point.","Reviewed in the United States on July 5, 2024","","Verified Purchase","One person found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

Also, after a few uses, the canister lock started malfunctioning, meaning when I removed the canister to dump it, it opened and instead, all the dirt went on my feet and floor.

But it's very light, it's easy for me to use having back problems. It is more narrow but is perfect for fitting in small areas like in a bathroom. What the coolest feature is you don't have to adjust the level. You can go from Bear floor to carpet and not even have to adjust anything in the suction is amazing. You do have to stop more frequent to empty cuz everything about this vacuum is smaller and more compact. But living in a quad level it's extremely easy to just lift and carry it from one level to another with no problems whatsoever. I do however treat it a little more delicately cuz I do feel like it's kind of cheaply made. But we'll see how long it lasts you sure can't beat it for the price. I would highly recommend this whether you lived in an apartment or a large home I really feel this is going to make cleaning so much easier for me and on my back. We'll see how long it lasts but even with that said if it only lasted a few years it's still worth it. I will continue to just be gentle with it and not bump into things and not tug on it oh and one other thing it does have an extremely long cord which is very nice.","Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2024","","Verified Purchase","22 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

Held my breath, spent some money, and a few days later it arrived in a box that seemed FAR too light. After doing the rudimentary cord disentanglement and snapping the aux accessories I probably won't use into place, I picked it up. No way could this work. It was far too light.<br><br>Tried it out the next day. If I were going to have a conversation about vacuuming with the Dyson it would go something like this:<br><br>Me: Hey, the floors are disastrous. I'd really like to vacuum today.<br>Dyson: Ok, as long as Mercury isn't in retrograde and the sun is in the seventh house of Aquarius, and the moon is 2.2 degrees north of Saturn in the final quadrant of the elliptical house, and my astrology is beneficial for today, and you had a protein shake, and you didn't use your humidifier last night because I hate that ghastly thing, and your niece in North Carolina is skipping rope while you hit the power switch...maybe.<br><br>Now with this impossibly small and light Bissell:<br>Me: I want to vacuum my floors please; they're a horrible mess.<br>Bissell: I WANNA SUCK UP SOME DIRT AND LOTS OF CAT HAIRRRRR!!<br><br>One pass through my bedroom was enough to fill the poor machine but I emptied it and sallied forth. I had to use chopsticks to get the masses of hair and dirt out from around the filter so rather poor design there but I cleaned it and kept going. Ran like a champ, sucked like a champ, on both carpet and laminate floors it did great. I was pleasantly surprised and really excited to let the dust settle and run it again, and again, and again. Now I don't like in an allergic death trap (I have horrible respiratory allergies and allergy-induced asthma) quite so much anymore.<br><br>Sucks great, works great, filter could be better but if that's all I have to complain about, I'm calling this a win. Especially since I switched from my $500 Dyson POS to this little thing. I love it.<br><br>PS my Dyson story...So I had a $500 Dyson  (upright Animal Multifloor 2) for many years and maybe used it 20 times in all. Something would always go wrong. The power would cut out, it would blow out every fuse in the place, the suction was non-existent in the hose or on the floor or both. I cut everything off the roll bar, followed their tutorials for cleaning, deep cleaned the sucker...nothing worked. The hose was not blocked, the thing should have been just fine, it just wouldn't work. Three hours after I'd first called, I cut off the gentleman at Dyson who had told me my machine was out of warranty and was trying to persuade me to take it somewhere local to be fixed (so I could pay more for a vacuum for which I'd already plunked a hefty sum down) and told him I would not only never spend another penny on Dyson products, I would be doing everything I could to actively discourage everyone I knew from doing so. He was very nice and my beef isn't with him.

I rent an 800 square foot apartment with about 500 square feet of short/low pile brown carpet. I did not want to put a lot of money in a vacuum because I will be leaving it when I leave here next year. The attachments are cheaply made but this is an inexpensive vacuum.

This vacuum makes vacuuming so much easier and picks up hair, lint, dust and dirt not  visible to the eye. It does an amazing job and cuts the vacuuming time down due to its incredible sucking power. I was simply amazed at its cleaning ability and how much the clean view canister collected. It was easy to assemble and comes with a decent size cord far longer than most former vacuums I have had. This vacuum has made vacuuming rugs and floors so much easier and less time consuming. It has a weighted bottom for stability and sturdiness. This one is definitely a keeper.

The handle snaps in and it is plastic which feels a bit flimsy so we will see how it holds up in time BUT it has great suction. It has a short hose but the handle comes off and can be attached to the hose. I don't need a long hose so it wasn't a concern to me. I vacuumed yesterday and so I thought I'd vacuum again to see the difference in ability and I picked up WAY too much dirt off of a ""clean"" floor with this new vacuum. I also love that the company donates to pets. So far I'm very pleased with my purchase and I would buy it again.","Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2024","","Verified Purchase","7 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

PLEASE DO NOT change the the power of the suction as this is one of the best vacuums I have purchased in very long time that have such powerful suction, but I would really caution consumers to not use on loosely woven, fluffy, mohair, etc. type carpets as it will destroy it.","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2024","","Verified Purchase","3 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"
