No issues with connectivity and it’s picking up motion, person, and bell perfectly. Extremely easy to set up in the App and navigate settings etc. For mounting, As a renter, I purchased the door mount and it looks and works great! Super secure! I’ve been using the Ring doorbell for a month now and although I selected outside the recommended settings for recording length (1 minute vs. 30 seconds), i still have 73% battery life. Only 27% used in 30 days. At this rate, i expect my battery will last another 3 months before i need to charge. However, when i do, I also went ahead and bought an extra battery pack as not to lose any monitoring time. Also bought a yard sign  Very pleased with all my Ring purchases thus far and would highly recommend!

I can only assume that the hype is from being an early entry into this space because after using a myriad of home automation products, I have not been impressed by this Ring doorbell in the slightest.<br><br>-----------------------<br>1. Terrible documentation<br><br>The box contains a tiny leaflet with no information about installing the thing, just info on expediting your personal information into their system. The only hardware reference is a picture of the hardware included, with no part counts to verify that you got what you were supposed to or descriptions to explain what the fasteners in each of the four paper envelopes should be used for. Zero info for actually using the mounting hardware. There is additional info in the setup process in the mobile app; not good info and super annoying to pick details out but technically there. This is apparently not a product for grown-ups who learned to read actual words.<br><br>2. Bad hardware.<br><br>The package only contains two machine screws to connect to doorbell to the mounting plate. It's bad enough that the unit only has four holes for attaching to the mounting plate, leaving a gap at the top since no fasteners are used to hold the top half of the unit. It's far worse when one of the two middle holes gets stripped, leaving a razor-thin margin between mostly attached and dangling even if there was a third screw to add to the fun.<br><br>By the way, when I say ""envelope, I mean there are four tiny envelopes labeled A through D for the hardware. Not sealed envelopes, just folded over and tucked, so maybe there was supposed to be more in here but they fell out while being packed, since some fasteners fell out when I removed the envelopes from the box but before I untucked any flaps. No indication on the envelopes as to what each should be used for, just a letter, so you'll just have to figure it out based upon clues from whatever sources that you can find and any prior experience that you have with similar parts.<br><br>The screws are metal, the mounting plate is plastic, and the threads are tiny. Mounting the doorbell to the mounting plate securely is a very delicate balancing between having a secure hold and stripping the threads, even when fingertipping the little Torx driver that they include. I barely got resistance on one before it began spinning freely, leading to the aforementioned stripping; one of only four mounting holes now useless. By very, very slowly turning the screws in two of the remaining holes, I was able to get them to hold without stripping. They seem tight enough but I don't dare snug them down any more.<br><br>The mounting plate is angled to left or right depending on how it gets placed, but all documentation and video I found online, given complete lack of included docs, are either for flat plates or an add-on plate that angles vertically rather than horizontally. Fortunately not difficult to figure out but I spent far more time than necessary trying to figure out if it was supposed to be that way or if they screwed up what went into the box. I'm still not sure since the hardware picture only covers the fasteners but the plate works so letting it be.<br><br>The heads on the screws for the concrete anchors are about the same size as the mounting plate slot, so screws slide right through the slots when tightened, leaving the plate behind. No washers provided so it's just the screw head to hold. I drilled holes in the mount next to the slots so that the tiny heads on the screws would have something to hold after every screw popped right through the slot while hand-tightening. Note that the drywall anchor screw heads are larger so all of the people mounting doorbells to drywall for some reason should get a decent hold at least.<br><br>3. Insecure.<br><br>Physically, this thing is trivial to pull from the wall and take, although I don't expect most people would since the devices do get registered. But if someone decided that it would be funny to rip the device off of the wall and throw it into the street, that would kill 3-4 seconds of their day and $150 of your wallet. The battery takes about two seconds to remove; there is a small screw hole to secure it, although no screw included unless you're expected to use one of the battery and only one to hold the unit to the mounting plate. So by default, they make for a very easy way for the unscrupulous to get extra batteries for their own doorbell.<br><br>As far as software, it really goes out of it's way to farm out your personal information. Before you can even get to useful technical info, they're prompting for personal details to shove into their servers and inevitably leak out to the world, at least whatever info they aren't simply selling. And you have to expose some personal info just to get basic functionality since using the doorbell attached to your house and viewing the video through that camera on your house requires going through Ring via the Internet unless you pony up a lot more money.<br><br>There is no local storage. To get a simulation of local storage, you have to buy a completely different piece of hardware AND subscribe to an additional service. Keeping with the theme of the Ring app being more of a marketing tool than a tool to help manage your home.<br><br>They push a feature called Neighbors that tries to get you to expose more info to the people with the easiest access to your home under the guise of improving security. Admittedly, Ring is probably more concerned with targeting people in secured enclaves who don't actually need any sort of extra security but want something to deal with people at the door. But it does get marketed to everyone so something to be very aware of for the rest of the human race.<br><br>If you think that calling the app a marketing tool is an exaggeration, the main app page has an ad for another Ring product that takes up more space than the preview of the last pic taken by the camera and the managing icons above that preview. Above that, the top bar of the screen exists just to push the Neighbors function.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Not to say that it's all bad. The camera view doesn't reach the ground in front of the doorbell so not great for spotting packages stuck in front of the door, but image quality is solid otherwise. I'd say that the image quality is comparable to my ~$25 Wyze cameras. The rechargeable batteries are handy to manage with built-in micro-USB ports and quick-release buttons for quick swaps.<br><br>If the unit was available standalone and had an alternative to using it other than by feeding yet another avenue for identity theft then I could see them being a very handy part of a home automation setup. But it isn't standalone and does require farming out your info just to get very basic functionality.<br><br>In conclusion, I'd only recommend the Ring doorbell to someone whom I wanted to severely annoy and potentially rob, unless they were sufficiently handy and tech saavy to secure it despite the best efforts of Ring, in which case I'd just tell them to spend less money on something better. It's a shame because the basic doorbell/camera unit seems pretty good but everything around it is trash.","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","22 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

This is my amended review after speaking with Ring customer support.<br>Our doorbell is working better than ever, thanks to Ring customer support. Very helpful. Walked me thru some steps I wasn't aware of concerning settings. Also learned that part of the reason our doorbell wasn't picking up motion is because of where I have it mounted. These doorbells work better when they are at around 4 ft from the ground. Mine is over 6 ft due to a set of steps leading up to our back door. Settings were adjusted and I have ordered a wedge to go behind the doorbell. Ring customer support really came thru. We will be purchasing more Ring devices. Thanks Ring!!!!<br><br>(Our Ring doorbell has begun to operate on a ""now or then"" basis. Some days I get a notification when there is motion at the doorbell, someday I don't. The doorbell is located less than 10 ft from our wifi router, so signal strength isn't an issue. We have other wifi cameras 5x the distance from the router, and they work fine. Today, someone went to our back door and took something... the Ring doorbell never activated, recorded, notified... but the wifi camera 50ft away picked up motion. I will not recommend Ring to anyone.)","Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","6 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I set the motion and package sensitivity to the highest setting, turned on HDR, color night vision, auto recording length, and snapshot every 5 minutes. Motion zone is for people and packages only, with other motion turned off.  It is also close to my router so the wifi signal is very strong. So far, the battery is still at 35% after two months.<br><br>WHAT I LIKE:<br>-Battery can be replaced so you can put in new battery while charging the other.<br>-Clear head to toe capture of person. (My doorbell is in a well lit area at night so the infrared only works during a power outage.)<br><br>WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:<br>-No alarm.<br>-Motion warning is disabled. I guess they only allow that feature on “select wired and plug-in doorbells and cams.”<br>-There is about a half-second lag in the speaker and microphone.<br>-Motion detection is a bit slow and often captures people when they are almost at my front door. So if someone is moving really fast, you only capture them as they are leaving the area. I suppose I could turn on “other motion” but I don’t want it to be triggered by animals or moving plants/trees.<br><br>Overall, I am happy with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","7 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I decided to wait until the battery needed to be charged before writing a review.  Today is April 10, 2024 and the unit is still working and I've not had to charge it.  To me, that's GREAT BATTERY LIFE!  I usually have about 6 to 10 motion notifications a day. (I cause most of those myself).  My unit is mounted on the front of my garage and it functions as a security camera rather than as a doorbell.<br><br>I didn't take the monthly plan and therefore, I only get a message that there's motion detected at the doorbell.  However, if I immediately check the doorbell history there will be a photo of what caused the motion.  Occasionally, I see the neighbor's cat crossing in front of my garage about 15 feet out.  It picks me up in front of my truck about 20 to 21 feet away.  Now and then, a deer rounds the corner of my garage, and it picks it up too.  It doesn't hold the images very long but you can see what's there if you look right away.  I don't have any trouble identifying what's out there.  Since I don't pay the monthly fee, for me that's not too bad!<br><br>The doorbell unit is located more than 110 feet from my computer system and cell phone inside my home.

I live in an apartment complex that has security cameras, but only on the front side of all the buildings, which is....well whatever. We have a package thief. Plus, since our apartment is on the back (no cameras) side of the building, it just doesn't feel safe to come in and out alone sometimes, especially at night. Our apartment is upstairs, but our private entry is downstairs.  Anywho, so far, so good with the camera. The app was easy to install and I didn't have any issues with setup. I've gone through all of the categories in the settings and everything is pretty self-explanatory and easy to understand. I have it set to send me a notification on my phone and on my Echo Show when there is a person at the door. I already have a doorbell, so I'm not using that feature. My favorite part so far is my kids' reactions lol I have a 10 year old and a 16 year old and when they each got home from school yesterday, it was cute watching them make faces at the camera. I have a feeling it'll be a daily thing for awhile lol The other thing I love is the ""live"" feature. When my oldest got home, he'd forgotten his key, so I was able to talk to him from inside our apartment and let him know it was unlocked. I have a feeling that this will be one of my favorite features because I've just had ankle surgery recently, so getting up and down the stairs is a hassle. This will make it easier to ""answer the door"" without actually having to hop on one foot all the way down and back up.

I highly recommend Ring Doorbell and all Ring products, especially the battery operated devices for outdoors if you live somewhere that you cannot hard wire your devices.<br><br>I was able to easily remove the previous device I had mounted with super strength outdoor double sided mounting tape (a little extra elbow grease and a scraper to remove the residual tape) and mount this new device with the mount that is made for wireless mounting (the first Gen doorbell and mount  I had wasn’t designed to be mounted with tape but I made it work for my purposes and I was elated that Ring now has a mount specifically designed for the exact purpose I needed!)<br><br>I can’t recommend Ring products enough. They are reliable, easy to use, have great customer service, and are very durable. I purchase a plan from Ring to be able to store all of the recordings from my different devices and I absolutely love the Ring app for managing the devices all in one place. I’m aware there are many different products available now, and some are cheaper, but Ring works and you get what you pay for! 5 stars from a loyal multi-Ring doorbell and cam owner!","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","16 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

The doorbell works fine, as a doorbell that sounds over my various alexa enabled devices. Very good since I have them around the house and wherever we are we know when the doorbell is pressed.<br><br>2. The battery has to be recharged every few weeks. I had hoped for a couple of months.<br><br>3,. The big disappointments were the captured videos and the movement detection.  The device comes with a one month subscription to an Amazon security service.  So, for the first month, the movement detection worked fine as did the video capture function.  Once the subscription was over, movement detection became unreliable, and leaves and birds and cars on the street 5 feet away. Similarly, without the subscription, the system does not capture videos.  IT will only show live video.  So, if a bell push or movement causes an alert to you, and you are delayed getting to your video screen, and the person has going away, you have no way of knowing who had been at the door or if the alert was due to a moving leaf.<br><br>There is no good reason for the lack of video capture, since most people have a computer than can act as a server.  It would seem that the feature is not made available because Amazon wants to capture monthly and annual subscriptions<br><br>The problem with motion detection is at caused by the fact that, when the you do not subscribe, Amazon no longer gives you access to an intelligent recognition feature. The problem is compounded because the doorbell camera cannot be adjusted as to whee it is aimed.<br><br>I already had a camera on my front door and it gives an excellent picture and intelligent alert and it stores all videos on my system. So I use the Ring doorbell as a doorbell only, and I turned off the video and movement feature.<br><br>Uless you are happy to buy a subscription, I do not recommend this doorbell camera.","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","5 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I bought this doorbell to upgrade my front door.  Wow is it nice!!  I really can see the difference in verticle resolution.<br><br>These have a lot of great options and features that really give you good control over your devices with a few major cons that really are hard to overlook and should cost a few stars.<br><br>Pros.  Great alerts,  great video quality for just 1080p,  range, and night vision.  I can have it setup so if my front door gets motion alert, all the flood lights and cameras that can see that area light up and record.  You can share with family members and determine what cameras they can see and which they cannot.  I.E. we have a bedroom cam for our rottweiler puppy that has a large crate we can see right into during these early training months.  I'd rather not having my teenage kids seeing into my bedroom but them getting motion alerts for the doors is awesome.<br><br>Cons.  Local storage is blocked behind a paywall.  I literally bought a 512gb microsd card and found out when I couldn't find where to enable that you have to not just pay more than what I was before with one camera,  but you have to move up to their most expensive 20 dollar a month plan!!!  What... The...heck Ring!??!  I'm reading also that even after you do this,  you can't use both cloud AND local storage..  This is double dumb and downright either HORRENDOUS design by the developers or just intentional extortion via nickel and diming of their already paying customers.<br><br>I'm a 25+ year IT professional.  In EVERY camera system or data suite you care about,  local and cloud storage together IS the bee's knees.  It should be available on cloud no matter what in case of fire/ring alarm theft and local storage used for faster replaying of recent events up to the amount of data your SD card can hold.<br><br>Rather than giving in and paying,  I returned the SD card and said screw it.  I previously was paying about 3.99 a month for my single ring camera.  I got tired of maintaining my local IP camera setup and needing a vm (virtual machine) running to record and eating up storage on my NAS to save it all.  I was stoked when I saw the local storage.  I dropped over 500 bucks on doorbell cams for back and side doors,  flood light cams,  and interior cameras to ensure our pets left home are fine and being checked on when we go on longer trips.  I was OK moving up to 10 dollars a month for all that I get.  Adding another 10 on top for something that costs RING NOTHING for me to use. is unacceptable.  This is just a money-grabbing paywall and it needs to stop.<br><br>Lastly,  the biggest operational con besides this is the poor integration with Alexa for scheduling camera functions.  I.E.  I do like getting driveway alerts via the alexa when motion is detected because its a blind spot inside my house.  One window on the back side of the house can see the driveway due to garage location.  I set a schedule or snooze it to not give motion alerts if I'm having people over and it completely ignores this schedule and gives endless motion alerts via the alexa devices.  Stupid annoying and it seems people have been complaining about this on the forum since 2018.","Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2023","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","304 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I had to remove the doorbell once a month... until lately when something started causing the doorbell to drain to 0-percent in about 7-8 days. This is not good and such a hassle to have to recharge the doorbell when charging time takes hours! I thought at first that with the optional ""hardwired kit"" it this wouldn't be a problem, but the hardwire kit isn't even to power the unit at all - it only trickle charges it! So if your doorbell is using more power than the trickle charge can put back in, then it's pointless.<br><br>I dealt with that for about a month more until Amazon had their Prime Deals event, and when I saw that the more expensive Ring Battery Doorbell Plus was on sale, I bought it.<br><br>So here I am with a newer, more expensive, higher model Ring Battery Doorbell Plus. The mounting holes for the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus are different from the Ring Doorbell, I don't know why they couldn't keep something standard but apparently, all of the various doorbell versions have their own different mounting pattern. Once I got past this hurdle, the rest of the installation was easy and quick.<br><br>With the new Ring Battery Doorbell Plus, I immediately gained two good features: first, the camera view was much taller, they were serious when they said it has a ""floor to ceiling"" view as I can see much more with the newer doorbell - great for when I have deliveries. Second: the removable battery just fixes the biggest flaw of my original Ring Doorbell. I bought a second battery just in case after having such a bad time with the original doorbell, but it seems like the Battery Doorbell Plus is much more efficient with the power, as I have had it installed for a couple of months now and the lowest I saw the battery dip down to was 87%. Picture quality is very good throughout the day, even in the evening with the porch lamp on I can see visitor faces clearly and not blown out like other cameras.<br><br>So if you're looking for your first Ring doorbell, do not get the cheapest $50 version - do yourself a favor and go right to the Battery Doorbell Plus, it is worth the higher price and you don't have to deal with the shortcomings of the cheaper, basic version","Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2023","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","436 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

It seems to work fine for 24 hours and then it will stop sending notifications to my Samsung phone. I have to reboot the phone to get the notifications once again.<br>2.  Most days it does not exhibit any noticeable lag between detection and notification, but sometimes the lag can be up to 90 seconds. Nothing would have changed regarding orientation to the modem receiving the signal yet the lag is there.<br>3.  The almost worthless little instruction manual that comes with the product clearly states ""Download the full manual online."". Yet the manual for this product is nowhere to be found online and when I finally chatted with customer service they informed me that a downloadable manual does not exist yet. I am not sure if that was trying to tell me that one would be forthcoming or just forget it pal, you get no manual.

I managed with the old ring charging it about every 8 weeks.  When I got the new Ring doorbell plus, I originally thought the battery life was going to be problem and was unable to really turn on all of the features because every time the app would warn me about battery life and it already seemed not as good as the older ring.<br><br>So to solve this, I kept the new ring and found a way to run a wire from my old doorbell button to the spot where the ring is mounted and replaced the doorbell transformer with one that meets Ring's power source specs.  Once the device is hardwired - it runs on battery but trickle charges to keep it at or close to 100% charge.  Now I was able to increase snapshot capture, motion detection and fully take advantage of this model.  The motion and package detection work well and the camera is a nice improvement over the previous model from 4 years ago that I replaced.<br><br>Overall 5 stars if you have a power source.  If you don' t have a power source and rely on battery, your results may vary.","Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","7 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

This device is outstanding. The only con is charging.<br>We have frequent visitors to our front porch which means frequent doorbell activations. Even so, the battery lasts at least 3 months.<br>Charging: The device must be opened to release the battery, which then has to be connected to charging power via a micro usb. There is no external port to connect a charging cable, like the older Rings had. There is a screw at the bottom which secures the silver cover. Remove the cover and the battery comes out easily. The usb port is at the top of the battery. Today we pulled the battery at 30% and it took 5 hours to fully charge. To reassemble, the battery goes back inside, install the silver cover, and secure the cover and battery with a tiny screw. We have our Ring in a security frame which adds one more layer of metal to put the little screw at the bottom through.  The battery hole does not fully align with the cover hole so it's necessary to kind of put a push pressure the direction needed to line them up. The hole is at the bottom, so to see if they're lined up requires neck craning and a flashlight. Oh my goodness that little screw is hard to put in.<br>Ring does not currently offer a solar charger for this model. I'm not sure how they could design one, with the port all the way at the top, deep inside the device, but I'm no engineer. This model would be a dream if it had an optional solar charger.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","Configuration: Doorbell only","Verified Purchase","5 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"
