Sound quality is great, the case charges the ear buds so you don't need to charge the case as much, it holds a battery for a long while (I charge mine probably once a week and use them daily), the ear buds are magnetic so they glide smoothly into the case, they have touch functions on each ear bud (read manual for how to use), they are comfortable, they automatically connect via Bluetooth when you open the case so easy-to-use for sure and best of all they're cheaper than Beats. My husband has a pair of Beats earbuds and I'd say these work just as well as his but fraction of the price. And I don't need to download some app to use them like I would for Beats. Just easy Bluetooth connectivity!<br>The percentage number is how charged the case is and the bars on the left and right of that are to show how charged each ear bud is.<br>I LOVE them!","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024","Color: Black","Verified Purchase","6 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I wouldn't recommend if you're working in a noisy environment. Otherwise, great sound.<br>They're very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears easily which is especially good since I have cauliflower ear.<br>Battery life seems decent and the range is as expected.<br><br>Cons:<br>The touch sensitive buttons don't work at all. I mean literally at all. There's no way to pause audio, hang up a phone call or even shut off my pair of headphones without putting them in the charging case or picking up the phone. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to put touch sensors in such a tiny piece of hardware. Just put a real button on it. Please.<br><br>I would only say it was a good value because there was a coupon available that saved me $10 but if not for that I would be very disappointed in the value.<br><br>All that said, they still work alright and I really need earbuds right now so I can deal with no buttons for now.<br><br>UPDATE: The manufacturer reached out and sent me a new replacement pair to make up for malfunctioning buttons on my first pair. Honestly, they work great and for a touch sensor button I find that I don't accidentally press it like I have done in the past with different ear buds. All in all these are great value, the sound quality is nice and the seller takes care of their customers.","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2024","Color: Black","Verified Purchase","45 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

After that, I’ll give it another month or two and hopefully update to five stars.<br><br>Original 6/24/24:  These ear buds were perfect for what I needed, good sound quality, easy to connect.<br><br>It was a little annoying to have to disconnect from one device in order to connect to a new device (laptop vs phone).

I only was using them about an hour each day, and some days not even that.  So when I did finally need to charge them, it was past the 30 days for Amazon return.<br><br>And of course there was a problem.<br><br>After I fully charged them, the right ear bud no longer works.  After I removed from charging, when the display showed 100% for both earbuds, I connected but the right earbud didn’t work.  I put it back into the case and the case then didn’t even register the right ear bud.  I get the charge percentage for the left at 100%, but nothing shows for the right.<br><br>I tried cleaning the connections, resetting the case, nothing works.<br><br>I also tried reaching out to the company and never received a response.<br><br>They weren’t terribly expensive and they worked for what I needed them for (I was traveling and had forgotten my usual earbuds so needed a cheap, quick stand-in).

These are DEFINITELY v-shaped earbuds, and I was surprised when I played a jazz song and had the string bass, which I normally barely hear as it blends in, become the lead instrument. If you don't want potentially overwhelming bass then you'd have to pass on these, but I don't mind too much and it's really nice for some songs.<br><br>The battery life is really good. I have no clue about the earbuds without charging because I don't want to have them die on me while at the gym, but since getting them about five weeks ago I've used them for 1-2 hours a day three days a week and just today the case is down to 10% left so I'm recharging it.<br><br>I have some odd connection issues occasionally, but I honestly think that the hiccups are my phone just having bad blutooth since I've encountered it with other devices as well. The actual issue is that there's seemingly no way to turn these on or anything without the case. I once didn't check if they were on by starting music until I got into the gym only to learn that the left earbud wasn't on and couldn't be turned on, so I had to make a walk of shame back to my car to put them in the case, close it for a few seconds to make the connected earbud disconnect, reopen it, and then take them out again to have them both be connected, powered on, and synced.<br><br>Overall, they're comfortable enough (my left ear has a bit of a fuss with them but it's rarely actually a bother or anything) and the sound is nice. If you want good touch controls, however, then I'd hard pass on these and go for a fancier pair or something. I don't know why, but I can't figure out how to consistently get the touch controls to work. They make a beep when you tap them to register that it took the tap, but I just can't get them to consistently work so I have to pull my phone out to change volume, pause, or skip tracks.","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024","Color: Black","Verified Purchase","3 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

Not so much.  First, before I do anything, I always charge up things.  Both the right and left were showing 98% charged but I went ahead and charged them anyway.  I then paired them with my iPod.  That was the easy part.<br><br>So I took them out when I went to mow on Tuesday (28 May).  I had my iPod in my pant pocket.  Now normally with my Air Pods, I don't have problems with them staying connected.  Not so with these.  The music would cut in and out and sometimes, one ear bud would have music and the other wouldn't.  BTW...these are not noise cancelling at all and I knew that when I bought them.<br><br>About 1 hour into my mow/weed whacking, the right ear bud stopped working.  I ended up going and getting the Air Pods (the reason I bought these was so I wouldn't have to use my expensive ear buds).<br><br>When I went back inside and put them in the charger, the right ear bud showed it basically was dead.  The left one had some charge left in it though.<br><br>So.  Lessons learned:  wear the iPod on the arm with arm band so the ear buds stay connected.  Be prepared to get Air Pods as these don't seem to hold a charge.  Don't believe the percentage on the holder/charger.  You get what you pay for.<br><br>Update:  I was pleasantly surprised.  The company contacted me about the issues and even went so far as to refund my money.  Then, they offered to send me an upgraded version of these for no charge (I declined).  I must say that the customer service is exceptional.

I've never dealt with a seller so cool and if all I have to say is the volume doesn't blow my eardrums out like I want lol then I call that a win 🤷‍♀️ I left my original review up just so everyone can see that I wasn't happy at first, but they did right by me despite a not so nice review..<br><br>Despite my negative experience with the actual earbuds. I will say after posting my review the seller contacted me, and asked how they could make it right. They offered a new pair or a full refund..I took the refund and they said it was processed in about 40 minutes. So I can't complain on that front. Crap happens, but I do appreciate when a company is willing to say Hey we messed up, lets make it right..<br><br>I bought these to replace my earbuds I had over a year. I purchased them March 16....It's March 27 and the left side won't turning , won't connect, nothing. It's dead AF..As soon as I got them the case was defective. It wouldn't charge right..I had to tap it to get it to register and charge the ear buds<br>..I loved the heavy bass on these but they are garbage and I'm so pissed.

They can only actively pair to one device at a time.<br><br>Sound-wise, they're pretty good.  Good enough for both spoken and music/gaming.  Not the best, but I think they're more than acceptable to most people.  Calls are okay as well.<br><br>Fit wise, however, these are kinda weird.  The first time I put these in my ears, I wasn't sure if I was putting the correct sides.  There are ""L"" and ""R"" markings though, which was helpful.  But they kinda sit a little awkwardly in my ears. And the controls are also unusual, and not that intuitive;  you'll need to read the instructions to find where the controls are and how they work.<br><br>So, if you need a good backup pair of wireless earbuds, these are a good choice if you can get them at a deep discount (under $20).

Another good thing about these earbuds is they come with three different size silicone earbud covers for your ear, which is great, you will easily find the right fit for you.
