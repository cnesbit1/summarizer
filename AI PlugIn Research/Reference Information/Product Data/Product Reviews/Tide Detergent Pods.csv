I had to purchase a smaller quantity of pods in store, and I ended up paying a lot more for them compared to buying a larger quantity online.

I've never had any issue w/the pods, shipping is shipping &amp; Amazon has gotten worse w/how they package, DO leave instructions for your postal carrier ( there's a space for instructions when you're ordering) for specific placement of packages so they aren't left in the sun or contact your post office directly and ask if they can put a note on your address. When loading your washing machine ALWAYS put your pods in first so they're at the bottom of your wash basin, NEVER put the pods in last, on top of the laundry, I've never had a pod not dissolve or any stain from the pods. HE pods are for High Efficiency washing machines which means your machine breaks down the soap bubbles faster, it's suppose to work that way &amp; you're still getting fantastic cleaning power just without excessive sudsy bubbles, it's safe to use HE pods in regular machines too. I mainly use cold water when doing laundry &amp; depending on the item  I'll occasionally use warm water, again, I've never had any issues with Tide Pods &amp; you shouldn't either if, and here's the main thing, you put the pods in 1st, BEFORE any laundry. I hope this helps with any hesitancy you may have and yes, I would highly recommend Tide Pods.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2023","Size: 112 Count (Pack of 1)<i class=""a-icon a-icon-text-separator"" role=""img"" aria-label=""|""></i>Scent: Clean Breeze","Verified Purchase","5 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"
