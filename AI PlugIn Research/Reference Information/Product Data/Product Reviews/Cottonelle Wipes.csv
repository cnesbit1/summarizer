The 8 flip-top packs with a total of 336 wipes is a great value, and the packaging is convenient for keeping the wipes fresh and moist.<br><br>The wipes themselves are effective and refreshing, making them a good choice for personal hygiene. They are flushable, which adds a level of convenience for use in the bathroom.<br><br>However, I have encountered a couple of issues with this product. First, the wipes tend to tear easily when being removed from the package, which can be quite frustrating. Second, I experienced a stinging sensation upon initial use. This discomfort was unexpected and somewhat concerning.<br><br>If the durability of the wipes could be improved to prevent tearing and the formula adjusted to be gentler on sensitive skin, this would be an excellent product. As it stands, while the wipes are effective and the quantity is generous, these issues are significant downsides.","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024","Size: 42 Count (Pack of 8)","Verified Purchase","","","","[]","[]"
