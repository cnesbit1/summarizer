The set is perfect for my toddler, featuring vibrant and engaging images that capture her attention immediately. The books cover a wide range of essential topics, from ABCs and numbers to shapes and animals, which has been great for her early learning. They are the perfect size for little hands, durable, and easy to handle, making them ideal for young children. The shipping was prompt, and the price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality and the number of books included. This set has become an invaluable part of our daily learning routine, and I highly recommend it to other parents looking for an educational and fun book set for their young children.","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024","","Verified Purchase","6 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

I disagree with those that think they are too small - they are a perfect size for older infants and toddlers.","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2024","","Verified Purchase","3 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

These keep my daughter who is 14 months very engaged.<br><br>However, I don’t like some of the themes for infants.<br><br>For example- in the numbers book there are pictures of things my daughter either can’t relate to at all (holiday ornaments and painted eggs) as well as a significant amount of junk food she is hardly old enough to eat (cupcakes instead of muffins, hard candy that is a choking hazard, lollipops-another hazard, ice cream cones).<br><br>I would prefer that books aimed at young children don’t have so many sweets as babies can hardly eat the stuff and toddlers/kids don’t really need to be thinking about it in my opinion. I understand the candy and stuff looks ‘fun’, but it’s not ideal for us personally.<br><br>Overall I would have chose a different selection of items- sticking more to natural items.<br><br>Lastly, I don’t appreciate when books label some animals ‘farm animals’ and ‘pets’. Not everyone believes in using animals for farming. While we eat some meat, I know what it’s like to live a vegan lifestyle. I’d much prefer the animals be categorized by ‘mammal’ and ‘reptile’. I believe parents and kids should talk about whether they want to label an animal as a farm animal or not. Even as a meat eater, I still prefer to see a chicken as a bird that just happens to sometimes live on a farm, but doesn’t necessarily have to live on a farm. Farm animals as a label just sounds disrespectful and demeaning in my opinion as these animals did not always live in farms and are often abused on farms.<br><br>Overall, great books but with some aspects I don’t resonate with.","Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2024","","Verified Purchase","4 people found this helpful","","","[]","[]"
