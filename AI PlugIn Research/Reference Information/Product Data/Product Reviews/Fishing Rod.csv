Unboxing is very pleasing and all the individual components feel great; nice reel, 14.5kg test line(31 ish pound test), even the rod and little tackle box. Even has lures that ive never really seen or tried before. The eyelet protector when its collapsed is a bonus too. Nice smooth cast. The pole feels a little weird, never had one in this material and bafflingly light. Havent caught anything yet, not even a bite today so the action on the rod is untested. I do recommend saving the 30lbs test it comes with for a larger reel and stringing it with something lighter as the line is to stiff for the reel size. Buddy kept getting his caught around the reel bearing and mine would throw a birds nest from time to time. Note to the manufacturer: make the strap on the eyelet protector just a hair longer so it can still be strapped with the reel attached.<br><br>All and all, not a bad purchase for $35, still plenty of useful stuff here even if something does go south on me later.","Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2023","Size: 6.89FT/2.1M","Verified Purchase","","","","[]","[]"

Sometimes line catching when I cast.  Again, I think that's more user error than a design flaw.  Because of the telescoping feature, it's a tad cumbersome at the handle.

Kinda cool the pole and reel came with a small tackle box with some tackle and fishing line. The fishing line provided is sturdy but stiff on the reel and wants to recoil on the cast and birdnest so I will replace it with a more familiar fishing line.

Only Problem? I'm not a fisherman. I've been fishing with friends before but I cannot tell you what weight fishing line I was using or how to adjust the drag controls on the reel.<br><br>What I can tell you is that this is a really good deal for the money. The entire kit is very lightweight and easy to transport. It fits in a very small carrying case so you can keep this in your car and always have it at your disposal. It comes with just about everything you need to get started. And THAT is the main reason I was attracted to it. This is a kit that you can get started with without breaking the bank. Then you can learn the fishing craft and decide what you might want to upgrade to in the future.<br><br>For me, this was a great way to get started with fishing with a good basic telescoping rod and lightweight reel. I have no compulsions recommending this to someone (like me) who is just getting started and doesn't want to spend a ton of money to find out if fishing is right for you.<br><br>I am getting good use out of it and learning as I go. And my son has something to use when he comes to visit.<br><br>If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up.

The pole itself is collapsible which allows it to be stored in a pretty small bag along with the rest of its accessories. It comes in a neat little carrying bag to contain everything for you. This would make a wonderful fishing pole to take hiking with you because of how compact and lightweight it is.<br><br>The rod itself is decent quality. Once extended it feels sturdy to me. The reel is surprisingly pretty nice as well. It works smoothly and I'm not sure what else I could want from it. Make sure you tighten things down well and it should work good for you.<br><br>I love that this is like a little fishing kit. It includes everything you need to get started or to keep a little kit in your car for when you go camping. They give you 100m of line to start out and get the pole ready for your first trip. They also include many different lures and baits here too.<br><br>Overall this is a really nice rod and reel for either your main or your backup. I don't think you will have any issues at all catching normal fish with this thing. If you step up to a fairly heavy fish then you might have issues. But for just your average fishing this works well in my eyes.","Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2021","Size: 6.89FT/2.1M","","","","","[]","[]"

Meaning, the glue that held one of the bottom portions of the handle on simply unglued and slipped right off without much pulling on it. It was actually one of my sons attempts at simply opening the Rod up, to set up his rig.<br><br>Fixable with a little two-part Epoxy but it is currently waiting for attention from dad and hopefully he will find time!<br><br>Otherwise, I think for the price of the reel itself is excellent. Smooth and easy to operate. It actually has a little bit of a stiff feel to it when reeling in but for my son I think that’s perfect. It helps him moderate the speed with which he pulls in his Lors as we are primarily fishing on rivers.<br><br>There are a lot of different options out there for telescoping rods, and I just think the overall quality and design of this one is poor. Furthermore, I’ve never owned a fishing rod without foam or cork hardly at all in the handle area and while it makes it more compact, I really have decided I don’t like the lack of a true handle and even a telescoping rod. I recognize that for the price it’s a phenomenal deal - you get rod and reel as well as a little zippered pouch and a few other fishing supplies (which we will probably never use as trout fisherman).","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2021","Size: 6.89FT/2.1M","","","","","[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GKku9XAnL._SY88.jpg""]","[""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81GKku9XAnL.jpg""]"

It can cast pretty far as long as you have some weight attached to the end of the line. The reel has worked well without a single bird or rat nest problem and no line twist. The drag on the reel is responsive a easy for beginners to operate. I did not encounter any issues while inspecting and using this fishing rod.

Telescoping rod is actually pretty good quality IMO.  Telescopes smoothly and easy to setup.  2.1 meter length when fully extended (6.9 feet).  Spinning reel feels good for the price as well.<br><br> ++Compact portable kit.  Comes with a nice little bag.  Keep this pole, reel, and accessories in your car trunk and you are ready for the unexpected when you're randomly out in BFE and see a hidden stream with the perfect trout pool.<br><br>So overall, for ~$36 this portable kit will get you or your sponsee out there in nature fishing wherever, whenever.  Why not, sounds adventurous.  This kit is good bang for the buck - hence 5-STAR rating by me in consideration of price/value.","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2021","Size: 6.89FT/2.1M","","","","","[]","[]"

We had a few adults and kids so we took turns between 3 rods that we brought. This one telescopes nice, it's a lightweight rod that handles easily in the lake. It comes with everything you need: Lures, hooks, bobbles etc in a separate plastic case. Nice complete set up ready to go fishing with. Was one of the favorite among the 3 poles we brought.","Reviewed in the United States on August 3, 2021","Size: 7.87FT/2.4M","","One person found this helpful","","","[]","[]"

The max fish weight for this rod should be around 10 lbs, or I feel it will snap. I mean it is telescopic which means it retracts so its construction is not the best for heavy weight fishing so you need to set your expectation right.<br><br>As far as completeness, this is a complete set, with rod, reel, line, and hooks and baits. The reel is small but it has most the features you can find from professional reel. The supplied line and hooks are convenient and good enough for beginner and recreational uses. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. It also came with nylon storage bag and it fits an assembled rod and reel so you don't have to take the reel off, just collapse the reel handle which is just a click of button.","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2021","Size: 7.87FT/2.4M","","","","","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IMsUETlkL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rl-BW4bBL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81U6K0qeLDL._SY88.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9129GYxq4ML._SY88.jpg""]","[""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81IMsUETlkL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Rl-BW4bBL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81U6K0qeLDL.jpg"",""https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9129GYxq4ML.jpg""]"

The rod has a few scratches all around the gold design and the actual pull out part has a few scuff marks. Not really impressed with the quality as I expected more since it came “wrapped up” and in a box vs. the ones on the floor at the store. I can’t speak for the performance on how it holds up just yet since it’s a gift. I really hope the recipient enjoys it and last them a good bit.","Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2021","Size: 6.89FT/2.1M","","","","","[]","[]"
