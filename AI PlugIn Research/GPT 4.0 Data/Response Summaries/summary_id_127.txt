To ensure that the `pd.read_csv()` function correctly reads a file path that contains spaces, you should enclose the file path in quotation marks, which you've already done.
Additionally, make sure that the file path is correct and accessible.
Here's the basic usage, which should work if the path is correct:



If you encounter issues related to the spaces in the file path, you can try using a raw string by adding an `r` before the path string, which tells Python to treat backslashes as literal characters rather than escape characters.
However, since your path uses forward slashes, this shouldn't be necessary.
Ensure the following:

1.
**Google Drive is Mounted**: You need to make sure that your Google Drive is correctly mounted in your Colab environment.
2.
**File Path is Correct**: Verify that the file path is accurate and the file exists at that location.
Here is the complete process, including mounting Google Drive:



By mounting Google Drive and ensuring the file path is correct, you should be able to read the CSV file even if the path contains spaces.
If you encounter any issues, double-check the file path and ensure the file is in the correct location on your Google Drive.

Summary: 
Additionally, make sure that the file path is correct and accessible.
