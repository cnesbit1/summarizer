Original Response: 
Your `webSocketHandler` class seems to be designed to handle WebSocket messages and manage connections between clients and the server.
However, there are a few areas that need to be addressed or clarified:

1.
**ConnectionManager Dependency**: Your `webSocketHandler` class relies on a `ConnectionManager` instance, which is responsible for managing connections.
Ensure that this dependency is properly initialized and accessible within your WebSocket handler.
2.
**Message Handling**: In the `onMessage` method, you're parsing the incoming JSON message into a `UserGameCommand` object using Gson.
Depending on the command type, you're then attempting to handle various types of user commands.
Make sure that each command type is properly handled and that the necessary logic is implemented for each case.
3.
**Joining a Game**: The `joinGame` method is responsible for handling the `JOIN_PLAYER` command.
It retrieves the necessary information from the `JoinPlayer` object and performs actions such as sending the game state to the client and broadcasting a notification to other players.
Ensure that these actions are correctly executed and that error handling is in place if any exceptions occur.
4.
**Observer Mode**: Currently, the logic for handling the `JOIN_OBSERVER` command is commented out.
You need to implement the logic for allowing a player to join the game as an observer.
5.
**Make Move, Leave, Resign**: Similarly, methods for handling other user commands (`MAKE_MOVE`, `LEAVE`, `RESIGN`) are placeholders and need to be implemented with the appropriate logic.
6.
**Error Handling**: Ensure that appropriate error handling is in place for scenarios such as invalid user authentication, missing or malformed JSON messages, and any database access errors.
7.
**Broadcasting Notifications**: The `connectionManager.broadcast` method is used to broadcast notifications to all clients connected to a particular game.
Make sure that this method is correctly implemented and that notifications are sent to the appropriate clients.
By addressing these points and implementing the necessary logic, you should have a functional WebSocket handler that can manage client-server communication for your chess application.
Test thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected in different scenarios.

Summary: 
Make sure that this method is correctly implemented and that notifications are sent to the appropriate clients.
**Joining a Game**: The `joinGame` method is responsible for handling the `JOIN_PLAYER` command.
Make sure that each command type is properly handled and that the necessary logic is implemented for each case.
