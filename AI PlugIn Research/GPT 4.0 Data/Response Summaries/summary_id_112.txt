Original Response: 
Given the patient history you provided for this theoretical scenario, let's discuss how these factors might influence her blood sugar levels:

1.
**Physical Activity Level**: Being a yoga instructor and previously a dancer suggests a relatively high level of physical activity, which generally increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by muscles.
This would tend to lower blood sugar levels.
2.
**Keto Diet**: The ketogenic diet, which is low in carbohydrates and high in fats, significantly alters how the body uses energy.
Normally, carbohydrates are a primary source of glucose.
On a keto diet, the body switches to burning fat for energy, producing ketone bodies as a by-product.
This can result in lower blood glucose levels since less carbohydrate is being consumed and converted into glucose.
3.
**Sleep Deprivation**: Having a 1-year-old child and experiencing ongoing sleep deprivation can impact hormonal balance, including the hormones that regulate glucose metabolism like cortisol and insulin.
Increased cortisol levels can raise blood sugar levels by stimulating gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose in the liver) and decreasing insulin sensitivity.
4.
**Chronic Headaches**: While headaches themselves donâ€™t directly affect blood sugar levels, they could be a symptom of other stressors or health issues, including possibly the dietary changes or sleep deprivation.
Stress can increase cortisol levels, potentially raising blood sugar.
5.
**Weight Maintenance**: Maintaining a stable weight with a healthy body mass index (BMI) typically helps in maintaining normal insulin sensitivity, which supports normal blood glucose levels.
6.
**General Health**: The absence of co-morbidities is a positive factor in maintaining normal blood glucose levels, as many common co-morbid conditions like diabetes or metabolic syndrome directly impact blood sugar.
Given her activity level and diet, this individual might generally have lower blood sugar levels due to her ketogenic diet and physical activity.
However, factors like chronic sleep deprivation could counteract this to some extent by increasing cortisol levels, which can raise blood sugar levels.
Therefore, her blood sugar levels might fluctuate and could be somewhat unstable, influenced by her current lifestyle and recent lack of sleep.
This is a simplified overview and actual blood glucose levels could be influenced by many other factors including genetics, exact diet composition, and the timing of food intake relative to measurements.
For real-world applications or detailed study designs, consider consulting with a medical professional or a researcher in metabolic health.

Summary: 
This would tend to lower blood sugar levels.
Normally, carbohydrates are a primary source of glucose.
Stress can increase cortisol levels, potentially raising blood sugar.
