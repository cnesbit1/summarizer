Directly accessing files from the "Shared with me" section in Google Drive through a path isn't possible because these files don't reside in your own Google Drive's file system.
However, you can still access them using the file's unique ID.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to access and read a file shared with you using its file ID without moving it to "My Drive":


1.
**Get the File ID**: Obtain the file ID from the shared link.
The file ID is the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` and before `/view`.
2.
**Mount Google Drive**: Ensure your Google Drive is mounted in Colab.
3.
**Use Google Drive API to Access the File**: Use the Google Drive API to access the file by its ID.
Here’s the complete process:


1.
**Obtain the File ID**: Assume the shared link is `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J/view?usp=sharing`.
The file ID is `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J`.
2.
**Mount Google Drive**:
   

3.
**Install Required Libraries**:
   

4.
**Download the File Using gdown**:
   

5.
**Read the Downloaded File**:

Ensure you have access rights to the file and that the file ID is correct.
This method allows you to directly download and read a file that is shared with you in Google Drive without needing to move it to "My Drive".

Summary: 
The file ID is `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J`.
**Download the File Using gdown**:
