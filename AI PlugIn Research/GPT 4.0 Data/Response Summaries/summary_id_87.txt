Original Response: 
To check if a move is valid, you can iterate through the collection of valid moves and compare each move with the provided move.
If the provided move matches any move in the collection, then the move is valid.
Otherwise, it's invalid.
Here's how you can implement this logic:



In this code snippet:

- `game.validMoves(move.getStartPosition())` returns a collection of valid moves for the piece at the specified start position.
- `moves.contains(move)` checks if the provided move is present in the collection of valid moves.
- If the move is not in the collection, it's considered invalid, and you can handle it accordingly.
Otherwise, you can proceed with the move.

Summary: 
Otherwise, you can proceed with the move.
