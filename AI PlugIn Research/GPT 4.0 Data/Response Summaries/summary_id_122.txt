Original Response: 
The insulin receptor and glucose transporter are both crucial components in the process of glucose uptake by cells, but they serve distinct roles and function in different ways:

- **Function**: The insulin receptor is a protein located on the outer surface of cells, particularly muscle, fat, and liver cells.
It functions as a receptor for the hormone insulin.
- **Structure**: It is a transmembrane receptor, meaning it spans the entire cell membrane.
The insulin receptor is composed of two alpha subunits and two beta subunits.
The alpha subunits are extracellular and bind insulin, while the beta subunits span the membrane and have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which is activated upon insulin binding.
- **Biological Role**: When insulin binds to the insulin receptor, it activates the receptorâ€™s tyrosine kinase to autophosphorylate itself and then phosphorylate other intracellular proteins.
This phosphorylation cascade leads to a series of cellular responses, most notably the translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane, facilitating glucose entry into the cell.
- **Function**: Glucose transporters (GLUTs) are proteins that facilitate the transport of glucose across the cell membrane.
They function to physically transport glucose molecules from outside the cell into the cell's interior.
- **Structure**: These are also transmembrane proteins but are primarily involved in the passive transport of glucose down its concentration gradient, through a process known as facilitated diffusion.
Some glucose transporters, however, are involved in active transport in certain cell types.
- **Biological Role**: Different types of glucose transporters are expressed in different tissues, reflecting the varying needs and glucose sensitivities of these tissues.
For example, GLUT4, the glucose transporter in muscle and fat cells, is directly responsive to insulin.
When insulin binds to its receptor, it signals GLUT4 to move from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface, increasing the cell's capacity to take up glucose from the blood.
- **Mechanism**: The insulin receptor is part of the cell's signaling mechanisms, responding to insulin and triggering intracellular processes.
In contrast, glucose transporters are part of the cell's transport mechanisms, directly involved in moving glucose molecules across the cell membrane.
- **Activation**: Insulin receptors are activated by the hormone insulin, leading to signaling cascades.
Glucose transporters do not directly respond to hormones but are regulated by cellular signals (such as those initiated by insulin receptors) that control their activity and location.
Understanding the roles and interactions of insulin receptors and glucose transporters is fundamental in comprehending how the body regulates blood glucose levels and how disturbances in these components can lead to metabolic disorders like diabetes.

Summary: 
It functions as a receptor for the hormone insulin.
- **Activation**: Insulin receptors are activated by the hormone insulin, leading to signaling cascades.
