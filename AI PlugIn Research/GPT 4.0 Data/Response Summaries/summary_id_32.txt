Original Response: 
If the folder containing the `responses` package is already marked as a source root in IntelliJ, but you're still encountering issues accessing classes within the `responses` package, there are a few additional steps you can take to ensure proper access:

1.
**Check package declaration**:
   - Verify that the package declaration at the top of your Java files (`signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java`) matches the directory structure.
- For example, if `signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java` are in the `ui` package and `responses` is a subpackage, the package declaration should reflect this:
     

2.
**Verify class visibility**:
   - Ensure that the classes you're trying to access in the `responses` package have the appropriate visibility modifiers (`public`, `protected`, or package-private) to be accessed from other packages.
3.
**Clean and rebuild project**:
   - Sometimes, IntelliJ's indexing or build cache may become out-of-sync.
Try cleaning and rebuilding your project to force IntelliJ to re-index and recompile all sources.
4.
**Check module dependencies**:
   - Ensure that the module containing your code (`src/main/java`) has the appropriate dependencies configured to access classes from the `responses` package.
If `responses` is in a different module, make sure it is added as a dependency to the module containing your code.
5.
**Inspect external libraries**:
   - If the `responses` package is provided by an external library, ensure that the library is properly added to your project dependencies in IntelliJ.
6.
**Check for errors or warnings**:
   - Look for any errors or warnings in IntelliJ's "Messages" panel or in the "Event Log" that might indicate issues with package visibility or dependencies.
By following these steps and ensuring proper package structure, visibility, and dependencies, you should be able to access classes from the `responses` package within your `signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java` files without encountering compilation errors.

Summary: 
Try cleaning and rebuilding your project to force IntelliJ to re-index and recompile all sources.
If `responses` is in a different module, make sure it is added as a dependency to the module containing your code.
