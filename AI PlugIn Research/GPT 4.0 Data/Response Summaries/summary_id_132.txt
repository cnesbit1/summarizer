Let's make sure you have the correct URL and local file name for `gdown.download`.
Here’s a detailed breakdown to ensure everything works correctly:


1.
**Verify the File ID**: Make sure you have the correct file ID from the shared link.
The file ID is the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` and before `/view`.
2.
**Construct the Correct URL**: Use the correct URL format for `gdown`.
3.
**Set the Local Path Correctly**: Ensure the local path is correctly specified within your mounted Google Drive.
Let’s assume the shared link is `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J/view?usp=sharing`.
The file ID here is `1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J`.
If you still encounter errors with `gdown.download`, make sure of the following:

1.
**Check the URL Format**: Ensure that the URL is correctly formatted as `https://drive.google.com/uc?id={file_id}`.
2.
**File ID Accuracy**: Double-check the file ID.
It should match the part of the URL in the shared link after `/d/` and before `/view`.
3.
**Permissions**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the file.
The file should be shared with you, and you should be able to access it through the shared link.
4.
**Library Versions**: Ensure that `gdown` is properly installed and updated.
You can install or update it using:
   

By carefully following these steps, you should be able to download the file correctly to your Google Drive and then read it into a pandas DataFrame.
