Original Response: 
The `session.getRemote()` method returns a `RemoteEndpoint` object, which represents the remote endpoint of the WebSocket connection between the server and the client.
This object provides methods to send messages to the client.
On the other hand, the `conn` object obtained from the `DriverManager` in your `DataAccess` class is typically a database connection object.
This `conn` object is used to establish a connection to the database and execute SQL queries or updates.
In summary:

1.
`session.getRemote()` returns a `RemoteEndpoint` object for sending messages over a WebSocket connection.
2.
The `conn` object obtained from the `DriverManager` is used to establish a connection to a database for executing SQL queries or updates.
These two objects serve different purposes and are used in different contexts within your application.
The `session.getRemote()` object is specific to WebSocket communication, while the `conn` object obtained from the `DriverManager` is specific to database connectivity.

Summary: 
This object provides methods to send messages to the client.
