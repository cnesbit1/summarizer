Original Response: 
Yes, you can clean up dependencies in your project using IntelliJ IDEA by removing unused dependencies and organizing the remaining dependencies.
Here's how you can do it:

1.
**Remove Unused Dependencies**:
   - Open your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven, or `build.gradle` file if you're using Gradle.
- Review the list of dependencies and identify any that are no longer needed.
- Remove the unused dependencies from the XML/DSL configuration.
- Save the file.
2.
**Organize Dependencies**:
   - IntelliJ IDEA provides a feature to organize dependencies in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.
This feature sorts dependencies alphabetically and formats them in a readable manner.
- Right-click on the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file in the Project Explorer.
- Select "Reformat Code" or "Reformat File" from the context menu.
3.
**Analyze Dependencies**:
   - IntelliJ IDEA also offers a "Dependency Analyzer" tool that helps identify unused dependencies and provides suggestions for optimization.
- In the Project Explorer, right-click on your project folder.
- Go to "Maven" > "Show Dependencies" if you're using Maven, or "Gradle" > "Show Dependencies" if you're using Gradle.
- This will open a tool window displaying your project dependencies.
You can analyze them to identify unused or redundant dependencies.
4.
**Use Maven and Gradle Plugins**:
   - If you're using Maven or Gradle, there are plugins available that can help clean up dependencies automatically.
For example, the `dependency:purge-local-repository` goal in Maven removes unused dependencies from your local repository.
- You can run Maven or Gradle tasks in the terminal or using the IntelliJ IDEA Maven/Gradle tool window.
5.
**Regular Dependency Maintenance**:
   - Make dependency cleanup a regular part of your project maintenance routine.
Periodically review your project dependencies to ensure that you're only including what's necessary.
By following these steps, you can effectively clean up dependencies in your project, which can help reduce the size of your project and improve build performance.
Additionally, removing unused dependencies can also make your project more maintainable and easier to understand.

Summary: 
- Remove the unused dependencies from the XML/DSL configuration.
- Right-click on the `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file in the Project Explorer.
You can analyze them to identify unused or redundant dependencies.
