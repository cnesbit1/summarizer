Original Response: 
Your `WSServer` class looks like a basic WebSocket server implementation using Spark.
Let's break down your code and provide some explanation:



- This annotation marks the class as a WebSocket endpoint, allowing Spark to recognize it as a handler for WebSocket connections.
- In the `main` method, you configure the Spark server to listen on port 8080.
- You define a WebSocket endpoint at `/connect` and specify the `WSServer` class to handle WebSocket connections.
- Additionally, you define a simple HTTP GET endpoint at `/echo/:msg` that returns an HTTP response echoing back the message from the URL parameter.
- This method is annotated with `@OnWebSocketMessage`, indicating that it should be invoked when a WebSocket message is received.
- It takes two parameters: the `Session` object representing the WebSocket session, and the received message.
- Inside the method, you send a response back to the client by using the `Session` object's `getRemote().sendString()` method.
Overall, your code sets up a WebSocket server using Spark and defines a handler to respond to WebSocket messages.
However, keep in mind that this is a simple example and may need to be extended depending on your application's requirements.
You may also want to add error handling, session management, and more sophisticated message processing logic as needed.

Summary: 
- This method is annotated with `@OnWebSocketMessage`, indicating that it should be invoked when a WebSocket message is received.
