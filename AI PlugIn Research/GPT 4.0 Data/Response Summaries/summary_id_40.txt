Original Response: 
The compilation errors you're encountering indicate that the compiler cannot find certain packages (`responses` and `server`) and symbols (`ListGames` and `JoinRequestData`).
Here are some steps you can take to resolve these issues:

1.
**Check Project Structure**: 
   - Ensure that the `responses` and `server` packages are properly structured within your project directory.
They should be located in the `src/main/java` directory if they are part of your source code.
- Verify that the package declarations in your Java files match the directory structure.
For example, if a class is in the `responses` package, its package declaration should be `package responses;`.
2.
**Verify Dependencies**: 
   - If `ListGames` and `JoinRequestData` classes belong to external dependencies, make sure that these dependencies are correctly configured in your project's build file (`pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle` for Gradle).
- Ensure that you have added the necessary dependencies to your project, and that they are correctly imported in your Java files.
3.
**Refresh Dependencies**:
   - If you recently added or modified dependencies in your project, refresh or reimport them in your IDE to ensure that IntelliJ IDEA recognizes and resolves them correctly.
- For Maven projects, you can try running `mvn clean install` in the terminal to force Maven to download dependencies and update the project configuration.
4.
**Check Version Control Integration**: 
   - Verify that your project is properly integrated with version control (e.g., Git) and that all required files and directories are tracked and included in the repository.
- Ensure that the `responses` and `server` packages are included in your version control system and are up-to-date with the latest changes.
5.
**Review IntelliJ IDEA Configuration**: 
   - Double-check the project configuration in IntelliJ IDEA to ensure that the source directories, package names, and dependencies are configured correctly.
- Verify that IntelliJ IDEA is properly synchronized with the project files and build configuration.
By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the compilation errors and successfully compile your code.
If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional details or code snippets for further assistance.

Summary: 
- Verify that the package declarations in your Java files match the directory structure.
- Verify that IntelliJ IDEA is properly synchronized with the project files and build configuration.
- Ensure that you have added the necessary dependencies to your project, and that they are correctly imported in your Java files.
