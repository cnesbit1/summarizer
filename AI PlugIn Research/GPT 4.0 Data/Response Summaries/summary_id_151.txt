Metabolic processes encompass the complex network of chemical reactions that occur within a living organism to maintain life.
These processes are crucial for converting nutrients from the environment into energy and building blocks needed for growth, reproduction, and maintaining cellular structures.
They also involve the elimination of metabolic wastes.
Metabolism can be divided into two main categories:

- **Definition**: Catabolic processes involve breaking down molecules to produce energy.
This includes the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins from food into smaller units like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids, respectively.
Energy released during these reactions is captured in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which cells use for various energy-consuming activities.
- **Examples**:
  - **Glycolysis**: The breakdown of glucose to pyruvate, yielding energy stored in ATP and NADH (a reduced form of NAD⁺).
- **Beta-oxidation**: The process by which fatty acids are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-CoA, NADH, and FADH₂, which are further processed to produce ATP.
- **Proteolysis**: The breakdown of proteins into amino acids, which can be used for energy or to synthesize new proteins.
- **Definition**: Anabolic processes involve the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler ones, typically requiring energy input (ATP).
These processes are fundamental for cell growth and the repair of tissues.
- **Examples**:
  - **Protein Synthesis**: Assembling amino acids into proteins based on the genetic code from DNA and mediated by RNA.
- **Photosynthesis**: In plants, sunlight energy is used to synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide and water.
- **Nucleic Acid Synthesis**: The creation of DNA and RNA molecules, which are essential for genetic information storage and transfer.
Metabolic processes are tightly regulated by the organism to meet the demands of growth, respond to environmental changes, and maintain homeostasis.
Hormones such as insulin and glucagon play significant roles in regulating these processes by signaling cells when to store energy or mobilize energy reserves.
These processes are interlinked and highly regulated, often involving signal transduction pathways that adjust the rates of various metabolic reactions based on cellular energy levels and external factors, such as nutrient availability or stress.
In summary, metabolic processes are essential for life, powering cellular and physiological activities through complex biochemical pathways.
These processes ensure that energy is efficiently produced, utilized, and conserved within living organisms, supporting all aspects of their growth, reproduction, and survival.

Summary: 
These processes are fundamental for cell growth and the repair of tissues.
They also involve the elimination of metabolic wastes.
