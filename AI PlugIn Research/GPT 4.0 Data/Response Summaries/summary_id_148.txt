Original Response: 
Glucose is a simple sugar and an important carbohydrate in biology.
Its chemical formula is \(C_6H_{12}O_6\).
Chemically, it belongs to the group of carbohydrates known as monosaccharides, which are the simplest form of sugar and the most basic units of carbohydrates.
Glucose is a hexoseâ€”a sugar molecule with six carbon atoms.
In its structure, each carbon atom (other than the one that forms part of an aldehyde group in the linear form) is linked to a hydroxyl group (OH), with hydrogen atoms filling the remaining bonds.
The molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) form or more commonly as a cyclic structure, which it adopts in solution.
The cyclic forms of glucose are in either a six-membered (pyranose) or less commonly a five-membered (furanose) ring.
Glucose is crucial for cellular respiration in organisms and can be metabolized to produce energy in the form of ATP through processes such as glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.
It is also a primary source of energy for brain function and is a key substrate in various metabolic pathways.

Summary: 
Its chemical formula is \(C_6H_{12}O_6\).
