Of course!
WebSocket handling can be a bit more involved compared to traditional REST endpoints because it involves managing persistent connections and handling real-time communication between the server and clients.
Here's a basic outline of how you can handle WebSocket connections in your Spark server:

1.
**Define WebSocket Endpoint**: In your `registerEndpoints()` method, define a WebSocket endpoint using Spark's `webSocket` method.
This endpoint will handle WebSocket connections from clients.
2.
**Implement WebSocketHandler Class**: Create a class to handle WebSocket connections.
This class should extend Spark's `WebSocketHandler` interface and override its methods.
3.
**Handle WebSocket Events**: Implement the methods in your WebSocket handler class to handle various WebSocket events:

- `onConnect`: Invoked when a new WebSocket connection is established.
- `onClose`: Invoked when a WebSocket connection is closed.
- `onError`: Invoked when an error occurs in the WebSocket connection.
- `onMessage`: Invoked when a message is received from the client.
4.
**Send and Receive Messages**: Within the WebSocket handler methods, you can send messages to clients using the `Session` object and receive messages from clients.
5.
**Manage WebSocket Sessions**: You can maintain a list of active WebSocket sessions to communicate with multiple clients simultaneously if needed.
6.
**Handle Lifecycle**: Make sure to properly handle the lifecycle of your WebSocket handler, including initialization, cleanup, and error handling.
7.
**Integrate with Your Application Logic**: Finally, integrate WebSocket handling with your application logic to facilitate real-time communication between clients and the server.
This is a basic overview of WebSocket handling in a Spark server.
Depending on your application requirements, you may need to customize and extend this implementation further.
If you have specific questions or need help with any part of the implementation, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
This endpoint will handle WebSocket connections from clients.
- `onMessage`: Invoked when a message is received from the client.
- `onClose`: Invoked when a WebSocket connection is closed.
