Original Response: 
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when carbon monoxide, an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas, is inhaled.
This gas can bind with hemoglobin in the blood, forming carboxyhemoglobin, which inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen to body tissues and vital organs.
The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often described as "flu-like" and can vary in severity depending on the level and duration of exposure.
Here are the common symptoms:

- **Headache**: Often the first symptom and can be severe.
- **Dizziness**: Feelings of lightheadedness or instability.
- **Nausea and Vomiting**: Common gastrointestinal symptoms.
- **Fatigue**: A sense of tiredness or weakness that is not explained by exertion.
- **Shortness of Breath**: Especially during moderate exertion.
- **Confusion and Impaired Judgment**: Mild exposure can lead to difficulty in concentration and fuzzy thinking.
- **Loss of Consciousness**: In cases of severe exposure, individuals may faint or become unresponsive.
- **Chest Pain**: Particularly in people with underlying heart disease.
- **Visual Disturbances**: Including blurred vision and brightness.
- **Seizures**: In severe cases, due to reduced oxygen supply to the brain.
- **Cardiac Arrhythmias**: Irregular heartbeats can occur as a result of hypoxia (lack of oxygen).
- **Cherry Red Skin Color**: A possible but not common sign, which may appear in some individuals.
- **Persistent Headaches**: Recurring and unexplained headaches.
- **Mood Changes**: Depression or irritability might become evident.
- **Memory Problems**: Difficulty remembering or concentrating.
- **Muscle Weakness**: Unexplained muscle aches or persistent fatigue.
- **Overall Malaise**: Feeling of sickness or vague discomfort.
- **Infants, the Elderly, Pregnant Women**: These groups are more susceptible to the effects of carbon monoxide and may show symptoms more quickly.
- **People with Chronic Heart Disease, Anemia, or Respiratory Problems**: These individuals may experience more severe symptoms at lower concentrations of carbon monoxide.
Carbon monoxide poisoning is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate intervention.
If you suspect CO poisoning, it's critical to get into fresh air immediately and seek medical attention.
Treatment typically involves administering 100% oxygen through a mask and, in severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy to quickly remove carbon monoxide from the blood.
Early recognition and prompt treatment are crucial to prevent potentially fatal outcomes and to minimize long-term health effects.

Summary: 
- **Nausea and Vomiting**: Common gastrointestinal symptoms.
Here are the common symptoms:

- **Headache**: Often the first symptom and can be severe.
- **Memory Problems**: Difficulty remembering or concentrating.
