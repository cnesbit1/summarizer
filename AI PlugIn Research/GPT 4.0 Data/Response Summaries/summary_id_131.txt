The `gdown.download()` function downloads the file to the local filesystem of the Google Colab environment, not directly onto your computer or Google Drive.
If you want to ensure the file is saved directly to Google Drive, you need to specify a path within the mounted Google Drive directory.
Here’s how you can adjust the script to download the file directly into your Google Drive:


1.
**Mount Google Drive**:
   

2.
**Install Required Libraries**:
   

3.
**Download the File to Google Drive**:


Here’s the complete script adjusted for downloading directly to Google Drive:


1.
**Mount Google Drive**: Ensures that your Google Drive is mounted to the Colab environment.
2.
**Install gdown**: Installs the `gdown` library necessary for downloading files from Google Drive.
3.
**Check for File Existence in Google Drive**: Specifies the path within the mounted Google Drive.
Checks if the file already exists in this path to avoid redundant downloads.
4.
**Download the File to Google Drive**: Uses `gdown.download()` to download the file directly into the specified path in Google Drive.
5.
**Read the File from Google Drive**: Loads the CSV file from Google Drive into a pandas DataFrame and verifies the successful loading.
By following these steps, the file will be downloaded directly into your Google Drive rather than the local file system of the Colab environment.

Summary: 
**Mount Google Drive**: Ensures that your Google Drive is mounted to the Colab environment.
Checks if the file already exists in this path to avoid redundant downloads.
