Original Response: 
To establish a WebSocket connection to the server and communicate with it using WebSocket messages, you can use the Java WebSocket API.
Here's an example of how you can create a WebSocket client to connect to the server and send messages:



In this code:

- We define a `WebSocketClient` class annotated with `@ClientEndpoint`, which marks it as a WebSocket client endpoint.
- In the constructor, we initialize a WebSocket container and connect to the server using the `connectToServer` method.
- We define methods annotated with `@OnOpen`, `@OnClose`, and `@OnMessage` to handle the WebSocket events.
- The `sendMessage` method sends a message to the server.
- The `close` method closes the WebSocket connection.
You can use this `WebSocketClient` class to establish a WebSocket connection with the server and send and receive messages according to the WebSocket protocol.
You'll need to adapt this code to fit your specific requirements and integrate it with your existing client-server communication logic.

Summary: 
- The `sendMessage` method sends a message to the server.
