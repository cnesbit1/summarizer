Original Response: 
In the context of your code snippet, `Connection` seems to be a class or utility method responsible for handling WebSocket connections.
However, since it's not defined in the provided code, I'll provide a hypothetical implementation for the `Connection` class based on the usage in your snippet:



In this hypothetical implementation:

- `Connection` represents a WebSocket connection and encapsulates the session object.
- The `handleCommand` method processes different types of commands received from the client and invokes corresponding methods to handle them.
- The `sendError` method is a static utility method for sending error messages to the client's remote endpoint.
This is just a basic example, and you may need to adjust the implementation according to your specific requirements and architecture.
