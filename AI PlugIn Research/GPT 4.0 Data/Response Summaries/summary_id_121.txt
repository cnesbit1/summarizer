Normal blood sugar levels can vary depending on the timing of measurement (e.g., fasting or postprandial) and the specific health guidelines referenced.
Here are the general ranges for blood glucose levels as commonly recommended:

1.
**Fasting Blood Sugar Levels** (after not eating for at least 8 hours):
   - Normal: 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.5 mmol/L)
   - Prediabetes: 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)
   - Diabetes: 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher on two separate tests

2.
**Postprandial Blood Sugar Levels** (usually measured 2 hours after eating):
   - Normal: Less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L)
   - Prediabetes: 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L)
   - Diabetes: 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher

3.
**Random Blood Sugar Levels** (at any time of day):
   - Diabetes: 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher, particularly if other symptoms of diabetes are present

4.
**Hemoglobin A1c** (average blood sugar over about 3 months):
   - Normal: Below 5.7%
   - Prediabetes: 5.7% to 6.4%
   - Diabetes: 6.5% or higher

It's important to note that these ranges are general guidelines and can vary slightly between different health organizations.
Specific factors like age, pregnancy status, and overall health can also influence what is considered 'normal' for a particular individual.
For accurate diagnosis and personal health assessment, it is advisable to consult with healthcare professionals.
