Original Response: 
Patients presenting at a hospital after prolonged exposure to fire conditions may exhibit a range of symptoms, which can vary based on the extent of their exposure, the type of fire, and the individual's health status prior to exposure.
Common symptoms include:

- **Coughing**: Persistent cough often accompanied by phlegm or soot.
- **Breathing Difficulty**: Shortness of breath or wheezing due to smoke inhalation which contains various irritants and toxic gases.
- **Respiratory Distress**: Severe cases might present with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) especially in those inhaling hot gases or chemical irritants.
- **Bronchitis or Pneumonitis**: Inflammation of the airways or lungs respectively, due to inhalation of irritants.
- **Burns**: Varying from minor superficial burns to severe third-degree burns depending on the exposure.
- **Irritation and Redness**: Smoke and heat can cause significant irritation to the eyes leading to redness, itching, and watering.
- **Blistering**: Chemical exposure or direct heat can cause blisters on the skin.
- **Headaches**: Due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and other toxic substances.
- **Nausea and Vomiting**: Often a reaction to the ingestion or inhalation of toxic substances.
- **Fatigue and Weakness**: General bodily distress and fatigue due to hypoxia from carbon monoxide poisoning or other toxic exposures.
- **Confusion or Disorientation**: High levels of carbon monoxide can lead to hypoxic conditions, affecting brain function.
- **Loss of Consciousness**: Severe cases of intoxication may lead to fainting or coma.
- **Coordination Problems**: Neurological impairments due to toxic effects on the nervous system.
- **Chest Pain**: Potential symptom of heart stress or heart attack, especially in those with pre-existing heart conditions exposed to smoke and chemical irritants.
- **Rapid Heart Rate**: Response to stress, hypoxia, or other physiological challenges.
- **Cherry Red Skin**: A less common but characteristic symptom of severe carbon monoxide poisoning.
- **Severity**: Symptoms can escalate to life-threatening conditions quickly depending on the concentration of carbon monoxide and length of exposure.
- **Anxiety and Stress**: Emotional response to the traumatic event and the distress of exposure.
- **Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**: Long-term psychological effect that may develop after experiencing such a traumatic event.
For individuals presenting these symptoms, immediate medical assessment and treatment are crucial.
Treatment might involve stabilization of the airway and breathing, administration of oxygen, fluids, and possibly medications to treat specific symptoms such as bronchodilators for asthma-like symptoms or analgesics for pain.
In cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, hyperbaric oxygen therapy might be required.
Continuous monitoring and supportive care will be essential for recovery.
Medical personnel should be prepared to treat a range of injuries and complications, from minor irritations to life-threatening conditions, depending on the patient's exposure during a fire.

Summary: 
- **Headaches**: Due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and other toxic substances.
- **Anxiety and Stress**: Emotional response to the traumatic event and the distress of exposure.
- **Severity**: Symptoms can escalate to life-threatening conditions quickly depending on the concentration of carbon monoxide and length of exposure.
