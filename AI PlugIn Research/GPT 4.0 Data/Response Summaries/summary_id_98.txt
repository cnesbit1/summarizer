To integrate WebSocket connections into your Spark server, you can follow these steps:

1.
Define a WebSocket handler class that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class will handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
2.
Register a WebSocket endpoint in your `Server` class to map WebSocket connections to the WebSocket handler.
3.
Implement the logic inside the WebSocket handler to handle incoming messages and manage WebSocket sessions.
Here's how you can modify your `Server` class to include WebSocket functionality:



In this code:

- We've added `registerWebSocketHandlers()` method to register WebSocket handlers.
- We've defined a WebSocket endpoint using `Spark.webSocket("/connect", MyWebSocketHandler.class)`.
This maps the `/connect` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
- We've created a nested class `MyWebSocketHandler` that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class defines how to handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
You can customize the behavior inside the `MyWebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket events according to your application requirements.

Summary: 
This maps the `/connect` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
