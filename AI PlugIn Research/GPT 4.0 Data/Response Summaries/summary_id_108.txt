Original Response: 
In a two-stack pushdown automaton (PDA), transitions are typically represented using a notation similar to that of regular PDAs, but with additional information to handle operations on two stacks.
Here's a general syntax for transitions in a two-stack PDA:

\[ (q, a, X, Y) \rightarrow (p, \alpha, \beta) \]

- \( q \) is the current state of the PDA.
- \( a \) is the input symbol being read.
- \( X \) and \( Y \) represent the symbols popped from the two stacks.
- \( p \) is the next state of the PDA.
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) represent the symbols pushed onto the two stacks.
Here's an explanation of each component:

- \( q \) is the current state of the PDA.
- \( a \) is the input symbol being read.
It is usually from the input alphabet.
- \( X \) is the symbol popped from the first stack.
- \( Y \) is the symbol popped from the second stack.
- \( p \) is the next state of the PDA.
- \( \alpha \) is the symbol pushed onto the first stack.
- \( \beta \) is the symbol pushed onto the second stack.
Note: Depending on the specific formalism or notation being used, the syntax may vary slightly.
Some notations might explicitly label the stacks or provide additional information about stack operations.
Additionally, the transition function might include epsilon transitions (transitions without consuming an input symbol).
However, the general structure outlined above is commonly used to represent transitions in two-stack PDAs.

Summary: 
- \( a \) is the input symbol being read.
- \( p \) is the next state of the PDA.
