Original Response: 
Yes, you can compute the padding for each row in a BMP file based on the width, but simply taking the width modulo 4 isn't quite sufficient on its own due to how BMP row sizes must align.
Let's explore why and how to compute it correctly.
The goal of padding is to ensure that each row of pixel data in the BMP format ends up being a multiple of 4 bytes.
Each pixel in a 24-bit BMP (the common format) uses 3 bytes (one for each of red, green, and blue).
Thus, the total number of bytes used by the pixels in each row is `3 * width`.
The correct calculation for padding involves ensuring that this total length of the row is a multiple of 4.
The formula for the padding can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Padding} = (4 - (\text{Width} \times 3 \mod 4)) \mod 4 \]

This formula works by:
1.
Calculating the total byte count of pixel data per row (`Width * 3`).
2.
Taking this result modulo 4 to find out how far off it is from the nearest higher multiple of 4.
3.
Subtracting this remainder from 4 gives the number of padding bytes needed to reach the next multiple of 4.
4.
The result of the subtraction is taken modulo 4 to handle cases where the row length is already a multiple of 4 (thus no padding is needed).
If your image width is, say, 10 pixels, the row byte length will be `10 * 3 = 30 bytes`.
Here's how the padding is calculated:
- `30 % 4` gives a remainder of 2.
- `4 - 2 = 2`, so 2 bytes of padding are needed to make the row length a multiple of 4.
Using just `Width % 4` to calculate padding won't correctly handle the bytes per pixel and can lead to wrong padding calculations:
- For example, if `Width = 10`, then `Width % 4` yields 2, which doesn't relate directly to the byte length of the row or the required padding.
- The calculation must consider the total byte length after accounting for the bytes per pixel, which is why we use `(Width * 3 % 4)` in the formula.
By ensuring the calculation is based on the total bytes per row rather than just the width, your BMP file will maintain the necessary alignment for efficient processing and compatibility.

Summary: 
Thus, the total number of bytes used by the pixels in each row is `3 * width`.
Calculating the total byte count of pixel data per row (`Width * 3`).
Here's how the padding is calculated:
- `30 % 4` gives a remainder of 2.
