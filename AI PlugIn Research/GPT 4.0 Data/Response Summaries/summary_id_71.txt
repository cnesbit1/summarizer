Original Response: 
To loop through all the connections stored in the `connections` hashmap in your `ConnectionManager` class, you can use the `values()` method of the `ConcurrentHashMap` class.
This method returns a collection view of the connections, which you can then iterate over using a loop.
Here's how you can do it:



In this code snippet:

- `connections.get(gameID)` retrieves the collection of connections associated with the specified `gameID`.
- The loop iterates over each `Connection` object in the collection.
- For each connection, it checks if the session is open and if the authentication token is not equal to the `excludeAuthToken`.
If both conditions are true, it sends the notification to that connection.
Make sure to handle cases where the `gameID` does not exist in the `connections` hashmap to avoid null pointer exceptions.

Summary: 
- The loop iterates over each `Connection` object in the collection.
