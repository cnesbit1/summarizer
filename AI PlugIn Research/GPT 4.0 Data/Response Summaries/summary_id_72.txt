Original Response: 
To loop through all the connections stored in the `connections` hashmap within the `getConnection` method of your `ConnectionManager` class, you can iterate over the values of the hashmap.
Here's how you can do it:



In this code snippet:

- We iterate over the values of the `connections` hashmap using the `values()` method.
This returns a collection of collections of `Connection` objects.
- We then iterate over each `Connection` object within each collection.
- For each connection, we check if its authentication token matches the provided `authString`.
If a match is found, we return the connection.
- If no matching connection is found, we return `null`.

Summary: 
If a match is found, we return the connection.
