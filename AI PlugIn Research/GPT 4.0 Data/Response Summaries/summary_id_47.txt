Original Response: 
Certainly!
Let's adapt your code to match the structure you provided earlier.
Here's how you can modify your `WSServer` class:



In this adapted version:

1.
We import the necessary WebSocket classes from Jetty.
2.
The `main` method creates an instance of your `Server` class and runs it on port 8080.
3.
The `onConnect` method is invoked when a new WebSocket connection is established.
You can handle any initialization logic here.
4.
The `onMessage` method is invoked when a WebSocket message is received.
You can handle message processing and respond back to the client here.
Make sure you have all necessary dependencies added to your project to support WebSocket handling with Jetty.
If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
You can handle any initialization logic here.
We import the necessary WebSocket classes from Jetty.
