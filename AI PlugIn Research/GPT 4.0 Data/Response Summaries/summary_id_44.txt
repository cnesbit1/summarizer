Original Response: 
It seems like you have provided the skeleton code for your server implementation.
Let me provide some feedback and suggestions:

1.
**Code Organization**: Your code is well-structured and organized into separate packages and classes, which is good for maintainability and readability.
2.
**Exception Handling**: You have included exception handling in your methods, which is crucial for robustness.
Ensure that exceptions are handled appropriately and provide meaningful error messages to clients.
3.
**Dependency Injection**: You are using dependency injection by passing DAO instances to your handlers.
This is a good practice as it makes your code more modular and easier to test.
4.
**WebSocket Endpoint**: You've defined a WebSocket endpoint for `/connect`.
Make sure to implement the WebSocket logic for handling connections and messages.
5.
**Clearing Data**: You have a method `clearApplication` to handle clearing data.
Make sure to implement this method properly to clear relevant data from your database.
6.
**REST Endpoints**: Your REST endpoints are defined for registering users, managing sessions, listing games, creating games, and joining games.
Ensure that these endpoints are implemented correctly according to your application requirements.
7.
**Stopping the Server**: You have implemented a method `stop` to stop the Spark server.
Make sure to call this method appropriately when your server needs to shut down.
8.
**Documentation**: Adding comments or documentation to your code will help others understand the purpose and functionality of each method or class.
Overall, your code structure looks good, but you need to implement the actual functionality for each endpoint, including WebSocket handling.
Test your server thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected and handles various edge cases and error conditions properly.
If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any part of your implementation, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
Make sure to implement the WebSocket logic for handling connections and messages.
Make sure to call this method appropriately when your server needs to shut down.
Make sure to implement this method properly to clear relevant data from your database.
