Original Response: 
It seems there are compilation errors related to missing packages and symbols.
The errors indicate that certain packages and classes are not found.
Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1.
**Package `responses` does not exist**: This error suggests that the package `responses` is not available or not imported in the files `signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java`.
You need to ensure that the `responses` package exists and is correctly imported in these files.
2.
**Package `server` does not exist**: Similarly, there's an error indicating that the package `server` does not exist in the `Main.java` file.
You should verify that the `server` package is present and properly imported.
3.
**Cannot find symbol**: This error typically occurs when the compiler cannot locate a particular class or interface.
In `serverFacade.java`, it's unable to find the `ListGames` and `JoinRequestData` classes.
Make sure these classes are defined in the correct package and imported properly in `serverFacade.java`.
To resolve these issues:

- Check if the required packages (`responses` and `server`) are properly set up in your project structure.
- Ensure that the necessary classes (`ListGames` and `JoinRequestData`) are defined in the appropriate packages and imported correctly in the relevant files.
- If you're using an IDE, it may provide suggestions or quick fixes to resolve these compilation errors.
- Verify that all dependencies are correctly included in your project configuration.
Once you've addressed these issues, try compiling your code again.
If you encounter any further problems, feel free to ask for assistance!

Summary: 
You should verify that the `server` package is present and properly imported.
The errors indicate that certain packages and classes are not found.
