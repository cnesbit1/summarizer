To create a WebSocket client specifically for your server, you'll need to adapt the code to fit your server's WebSocket endpoint and message formats.
Here's how you can modify the code to work with your server:

1.
Replace the WebSocket endpoint URI (`ws://your-server-url/connect`) with the actual WebSocket endpoint URI of your server.
2.
Modify the `onMessage` method to handle incoming WebSocket messages according to your server's message format.
3.
Adapt the `sendMessage` method to send messages compatible with your server's expectations.
Here's the modified code with placeholders for your server-specific details:



Replace `"ws://your-server-url/connect"` with the actual WebSocket endpoint URL provided by your server.

Modify the `sendMessage` method to send messages compatible with your server's expectations.
You may need to serialize your messages to JSON or another format expected by your server.
