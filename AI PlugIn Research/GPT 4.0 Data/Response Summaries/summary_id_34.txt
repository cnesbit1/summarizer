Original Response: 
It seems that the compiler is still unable to find the `responses` package and the `ListGames` and `JoinRequestData` classes.
Let's troubleshoot this further:

1.
**Check Package Structure**:
   - Verify that the `responses` package exists in the correct location within your project directory structure.
It should be located in a folder named `responses` under the `src/main/java` directory.
- Ensure that the package declaration in your Java files (`serverFacade.java`, `signedInUI.java`) matches the directory structure.
For example, if `responses` is under the `src/main/java` directory and your Java files are in the `ui` package, the package declaration should be `package ui;`.
2.
**Check Module Dependencies**:
   - Make sure that the module containing your `ui` package has the correct dependencies configured to access classes from the `responses` package.
If `responses` is in a different module, ensure that it is added as a dependency to the module containing your `ui` package.
3.
**Reimport Maven Dependencies**:
   - If you're using Maven, try reimporting Maven dependencies to ensure that all required dependencies are properly resolved.
You can do this by right-clicking on the `pom.xml` file in IntelliJ and selecting "Maven" > "Reimport".
4.
**Check IDE Settings**:
   - Review your IDE settings to ensure that the correct JDK is configured and that IntelliJ is properly recognizing your project structure.
5.
**Verify Class Visibility**:
   - Double-check that the classes `ListGames` and `JoinRequestData` in the `responses` package have the appropriate visibility modifiers (`public`, `protected`, or package-private) to be accessed from other packages.
6.
**Clean and Rebuild**:
   - Try cleaning and rebuilding your project to force IntelliJ to recompile all sources and reindex the project.
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the compilation errors related to the missing `responses` package and symbols.
If you continue to encounter issues, please provide more details or share relevant code snippets for further assistance.

Summary: 
It should be located in a folder named `responses` under the `src/main/java` directory.
You can do this by right-clicking on the `pom.xml` file in IntelliJ and selecting "Maven" > "Reimport".
- Ensure that the package declaration in your Java files (`serverFacade.java`, `signedInUI.java`) matches the directory structure.
