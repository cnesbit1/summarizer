Original Response: 
Yes, IntelliJ IDEA provides a feature called "Optimize Imports" which helps clean up and organize import statements in your Java code.
Here's how you can use it:

1.
**Keyboard Shortcut**:
   - The quickest way to optimize imports is to use the keyboard shortcut.
On Windows and Linux, it's usually `Ctrl + Alt + O`, and on macOS, it's `Cmd + Option + O`.
Pressing this shortcut will trigger IntelliJ to remove unused imports and organize the remaining imports alphabetically.
2.
**Menu Option**:
   - You can also access the "Optimize Imports" feature from the menu:
     - Navigate to "Code" menu.
- Choose "Optimize Imports" from the dropdown.
3.
**Automatic Cleanup**:
   - IntelliJ IDEA can automatically perform import optimization when you save a file or commit changes to version control.
You can enable this option in the settings:
     - Go to "Settings/Preferences" (Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + S).
- Navigate to "Editor" > "General" > "Auto Import".
- Check the option "Optimize imports on the fly" under "Java".
4.
**Manual Cleanup**:
   - Additionally, you can configure IntelliJ to automatically remove unused imports without organizing them alphabetically:
     - In the settings ("Settings/Preferences" > "Editor" > "Code Style" > "Java").
- Under the "Imports" tab, check the option "Optimize imports on the fly".
- Uncheck the option "Sort imports".
By using these methods, you can keep your Java codebase clean and organized, ensuring that import statements are concise and relevant.
This helps improve code readability and maintainability.

Summary: 
- Choose "Optimize Imports" from the dropdown.
- Uncheck the option "Sort imports".
