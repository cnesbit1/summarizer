Original Response: 
Certainly!
Let's expand on the reasons behind step 4, which involves proving completeness and soundness of the reduction function:

a. Completeness: 
   - Completeness ensures that if an input x is in language L, then the output of the reduction function, f(x), is indeed in language Q.
- This part of the proof establishes that the reduction function covers all instances of L and correctly maps them to instances of Q.
- Essentially, if the reduction function fails to produce a valid output in Q for an input x from L, then it would not be a complete reduction.
b.
Soundness:
   - Soundness ensures that if the output of the reduction function, f(x), is in language Q, then the input x must have been in language L.
   - This part of the proof establishes that the reduction function doesn't map any input x outside of L to an output in Q.
- If the reduction function incorrectly maps inputs outside of L to Q, then it wouldn't be a valid reduction because it would introduce false positives.
In summary, completeness guarantees that the reduction function captures all valid instances of L and correctly maps them to Q, while soundness guarantees that the reduction function doesn't introduce any invalid instances from outside of L into Q.
Together, these properties ensure that the reduction function provides a valid reduction from L to Q.

Summary: 
Together, these properties ensure that the reduction function provides a valid reduction from L to Q.
