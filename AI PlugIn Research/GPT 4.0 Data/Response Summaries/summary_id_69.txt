Original Response: 
Your `WSClient` class seems to be a WebSocket client implementation in Java.
It connects to a WebSocket server running at `ws://localhost:8080/connect`.
Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.
The `WSClient` class extends `Endpoint`, indicating that it's intended to be used as an endpoint for WebSocket connections.
2.
It has a `Session` field to maintain the WebSocket session.
3.
The constructor establishes a WebSocket connection to the server specified by the URI `ws://localhost:8080/connect`.
4.
The `onOpen` method is overridden from the `Endpoint` class but left empty.
This method is called when the WebSocket connection is established.
5.
Inside the constructor, a message handler is added to the session to handle incoming messages.
When a message is received, it's printed to the console.
6.
The `send` method allows sending messages to the WebSocket server.
It uses the `getBasicRemote()` method of the session to send text messages.
Overall, this class provides a basic WebSocket client functionality in Java, allowing communication with a WebSocket server.
If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this code, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
It connects to a WebSocket server running at `ws://localhost:8080/connect`.
This method is called when the WebSocket connection is established.
