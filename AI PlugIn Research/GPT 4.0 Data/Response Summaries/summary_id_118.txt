Original Response: 
Turkey meat itself contains very minimal to no carbohydrates.
It is primarily composed of proteins and, depending on the cut, some amount of fat.
For example, lean parts of turkey like the breast are almost entirely protein with virtually no carbohydrates, while darker cuts may contain slightly more fat but still negligible amounts of carbohydrates.
In culinary preparations, however, turkey may sometimes be cooked or served with ingredients that contain carbohydrates, such as in sauces, marinades, or stuffing.
But the meat alone does not contribute carbohydrates to the diet.
This makes it a popular choice for low-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets.
