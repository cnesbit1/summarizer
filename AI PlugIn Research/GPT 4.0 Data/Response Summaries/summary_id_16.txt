To accurately determine the number of bytes needed for padding in a BMP image row, consider the formula based on the total byte length of the pixels in that row.
Each pixel in a 24-bit BMP image consumes 3 bytes (for the Red, Green, and Blue components).
The formula ensures that each row's total byte count aligns with a 4-byte boundary, which is a requirement of the BMP format for proper alignment and efficient processing.
Here's the precise calculation breakdown:


1.
**Calculate the total pixel byte count for one row**:
   - If your image width is \( W \) pixels, then each row will have \( W \times 3 \) bytes (since each pixel uses 3 bytes).
2.
**Determine how far this total is from the nearest multiple of 4**:
   - Compute the remainder when \( W \times 3 \) bytes is divided by 4, i.e., \( (W \times 3) \mod 4 \).
This gives you how many bytes over a multiple of 4 the current row length is.
3.
**Calculate the padding needed**:
   - The padding required to reach the next multiple of 4 can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Padding} = (4 - ((W \times 3) \mod 4)) \mod 4
     \]
   - This formula ensures that if the row is already a multiple of 4 (i.e., \( (W \times 3) \mod 4 = 0 \)), the padding remains zero because \( (4 - 0) \mod 4 = 0 \).
Assuming an image width of 10 pixels:
- Total bytes per row = \( 10 \times 3 = 30 \) bytes
- Compute the remainder: \( 30 \mod 4 = 2 \)
- Padding needed = \( (4 - 2) \mod 4 = 2 \) bytes

Thus, 2 bytes of padding are required at the end of each row to align it to a 4-byte boundary.
In your C code, when you read or write the BMP data, you'd need to account for this padding.
Here's a basic idea of how you might manage reading pixel data with padding when processing each row:



And similarly, when writing out the modified BMP file, you would add these padding bytes to ensure the file adheres to the BMP format specification:



By using this approach, your BMP files should maintain proper formatting and compatibility with BMP viewers and processors.

Summary: 
This gives you how many bytes over a multiple of 4 the current row length is.
