Original Response: 
To refactor the WebSocket portion of your code into separate classes, you can follow these steps:

1.
Create a `WebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket messages.
2.
Create a `ConnectionManager` class to manage WebSocket connections.
3.
Create a `Connection` class to represent individual WebSocket connections.
Here's how you can refactor your code accordingly:






With this refactor:

- `WebSocketHandler` is responsible for handling incoming WebSocket messages and delegating the handling to `ConnectionManager`.
- `ConnectionManager` manages WebSocket connections and delegates handling of commands to individual `Connection` instances.
- `Connection` represents an individual WebSocket connection and handles user commands.
You can further extend and customize these classes based on your application requirements and architecture.

Summary: 
Create a `WebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket messages.
