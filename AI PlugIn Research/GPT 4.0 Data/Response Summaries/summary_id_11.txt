Sure, I can help you get started with a simple C program framework that loads a BMP image file, applies a filter, and then saves the modified image.
Below is a basic outline to help you start programming this:

1.
**File Handling:** Read and write BMP files using standard C I/O functions.
2.
**Image Processing:** Modify the pixel data.
3.
**Memory Management:** Allocate and free memory appropriately.
A BMP file has a specific format:
- **Header:** Contains metadata about the file.
- **DIB Header:** Describes the dimensions and color format.
- **Pixel Data:** Raw bitmap data (actual image).
- **File Reading/Writing:** Open the BMP file in binary mode (`rb` or `wb`).
- **Header Structures:** Use `#pragma pack(push, 1)` to ensure the headers are packed without padding, which is crucial for reading and writing.
- **Filter Application:** Modify the `apply_filter` function to implement different effects.
In this example, it inverts the colors.
This is a basic framework.
You can extend this by adding error checks, supporting more BMP formats, or implementing different image processing algorithms.

Summary: 
**Image Processing:** Modify the pixel data.
This is a basic framework.
