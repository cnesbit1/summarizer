Original Response: 
When your body has a normal response to insulin, it is referred to as "insulin sensitivity" or "insulin sensitivity."
This term describes the ability of cells to respond appropriately to insulin, allowing them to take up glucose from the blood efficiently.
Good insulin sensitivity helps maintain blood glucose levels within a healthy range and is important for overall metabolic health.
Conversely, when the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, it is known as "insulin resistance."
This condition can lead to higher blood glucose levels and may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders.
