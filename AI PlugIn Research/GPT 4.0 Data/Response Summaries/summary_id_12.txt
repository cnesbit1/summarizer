Original Response: 
Your code provides a solid structure and is a good start for handling BMP files without using structs for headers, which involves manually parsing byte arrays.
Let's add the essential missing parts to complete your application.
Hereâ€™s how to proceed to complete your application:

Since you're not using structs, you need to manually parse the BMP header to extract necessary information such as the width, height, and pixel array offset.
Implement the functions for applying grayscale and threshold filters.
Ensure proper error handling and implement debugging outputs to trace errors.
Here's how to extend and implement the missing parts of your program:

Implement the `parseHeaderAndApplyFilter` function.
This involves reading specific bytes from the BMP header to get metadata like image width, height, and pixel data offset.
These are simplified functions for grayscale and threshold effects.
They assume the image is in 24-bit BMP format.
- **Testing:** Test your application with different BMP files to ensure it handles various formats and image sizes.
- **Optimization:** Consider optimizing the memory handling and processing speed, especially for larger images.
- **Error Handling:** Enhance error handling in reading, processing, and writing files, including checks for BMP format validity (e.g., bit depth).
This structure should help you complete your BMP processing application in C without using structures for headers.
Make sure to handle endianess and alignment if you target different platforms or non-x86 architectures.

Summary: 
They assume the image is in 24-bit BMP format.
Implement the functions for applying grayscale and threshold filters.
