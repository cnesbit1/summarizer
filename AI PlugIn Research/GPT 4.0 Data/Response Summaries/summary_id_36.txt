Original Response: 
If cleaning and rebuilding your project did not resolve the issues and you didn't observe any changes when checking with `git status`, it's possible that the changes made during the cleaning and rebuilding process did not affect the tracked files in your Git repository.
Here are a few additional steps you can try:

1.
**Check for Errors**: 
   - After the cleaning and rebuilding process, carefully review the build output in IntelliJ IDEA's "Build" tool window.
Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate unresolved issues with your project setup or dependencies.
2.
**Reimport Maven/Gradle Project**:
   - If you're using Maven or Gradle for dependency management, you can try reimporting the project to ensure that all dependencies are properly resolved.
- For Maven: Right-click on the `pom.xml` file in IntelliJ IDEA and select "Maven" > "Reimport".
- For Gradle: Click on the "Refresh all Gradle projects" icon in the Gradle tool window.
3.
**Inspect Changes**: 
   - Although `git status` didn't show any changes, it's still worth inspecting the files in your project to see if any modifications were made during the cleaning and rebuilding process.
Look for changes in file contents or timestamps.
4.
**Restart IntelliJ IDEA**: 
   - Sometimes, simply restarting IntelliJ IDEA can help resolve certain issues, particularly if there are any caching or indexing issues.
5.
**Check Version Control Integration**: 
   - Ensure that IntelliJ IDEA is properly integrated with your version control system (e.g., Git).
Verify that the VCS operations (such as committing changes) are working as expected.
6.
**Inspect Project Configuration**: 
   - Review your project configuration in IntelliJ IDEA, including module dependencies, source directories, and project SDK settings, to ensure everything is configured correctly.
If you've exhausted these options and are still experiencing issues, you may need to provide more specific details about the problem you're encountering, such as error messages or unexpected behavior, to further diagnose and troubleshoot the issue.
Additionally, you can try seeking assistance on online forums or communities where developers can help troubleshoot project setup and build issues.

Summary: 
Look for changes in file contents or timestamps.
Here are a few additional steps you can try:

1.
- For Maven: Right-click on the `pom.xml` file in IntelliJ IDEA and select "Maven" > "Reimport".
