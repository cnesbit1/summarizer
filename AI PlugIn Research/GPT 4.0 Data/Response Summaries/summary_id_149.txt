Original Response: 
When a semi-permeable membrane contains a solution of glucose and starch and is placed in an iodine solution, the behavior of the molecules can be understood based on their size and the properties of the membrane:

1.
**Glucose**: 
   - **Size**: Glucose is a small molecule (monosaccharide) that typically can pass through most semi-permeable membranes.
- **Movement**: Due to its small size, glucose can diffuse through the membrane from the area of higher concentration inside the bag to the lower concentration outside in the iodine solution.
2.
**Starch**:
   - **Size**: Starch is a large molecule, a polysaccharide composed of many glucose units connected together.
- **Movement**: Due to its much larger size compared to glucose, starch molecules cannot pass through most semi-permeable membranes.
Thus, starch remains inside the membrane.
3.
**Iodine**:
   - **Size**: Iodine (often used in the form of I2 or iodide/iodate ions in solution) is relatively small compared to starch.
- **Movement**: Iodine molecules or ions are small enough to pass through the semi-permeable membrane.
- **Indicator**: When iodine moves into the membrane where starch is present, it reacts with the starch to form a blue-black complex, indicating the presence of starch.
This reaction does not occur with glucose.
In summary:
- **Glucose** can diffuse out of the semi-permeable membrane.
- **Starch** cannot pass through and remains inside the membrane.
- **Iodine** can diffuse into the membrane, where it reacts with any starch present to indicate its presence visually.
This setup is often used in experiments to demonstrate the properties of diffusion and the selective permeability of membranes, as well as to visually confirm the presence of macromolecules like starch.

Summary: 
Thus, starch remains inside the membrane.
- **Starch** cannot pass through and remains inside the membrane.
