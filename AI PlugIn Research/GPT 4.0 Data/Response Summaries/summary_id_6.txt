Sure, I'll provide a simple example of how to set up and use logging in a Java application using the popular SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) with Logback as the underlying logging framework.
This example will cover the basic setup and how to log messages at different severity levels.
First, you'll need to include the necessary dependencies in your project.
If you are using Maven, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

Create a configuration file named `logback.xml` in the `src/main/resources` directory of your project.
This file will configure the logging behavior (like log levels and output formats):



This configuration sets up a console appender that outputs logs to the standard output.
The pattern dictates how each log message is formatted, showing the date, thread, log level, logger name, and the message.
Now, you can use SLF4J in your Java classes to log messages.
Hereâ€™s a simple example class that demonstrates logging at different levels:

- **Logger Creation**: A logger is created by calling `LoggerFactory.getLogger()`, passing the class name.
This logger is configured according to the rules specified in `logback.xml`.
- **Logging Methods**: Various methods like `info()`, `debug()`, `error()`, `warn()`, and `trace()` are used to log messages at different levels.
The level you choose should correspond to the importance and verbosity of the message.
- **Exception Logging**: Logging an exception can be done by passing the exception instance along with the message to the `error()` method.
This will print the stack trace along with the log message.
This setup provides a basic but robust logging system that can be expanded with more complex configurations, such as file appenders, filtering based on log levels, or even logging to external systems.
Logging is crucial for diagnosing issues in development and production environments, and setting it up early in project development is highly recommended.

Summary: 
Now, you can use SLF4J in your Java classes to log messages.
This will print the stack trace along with the log message.
