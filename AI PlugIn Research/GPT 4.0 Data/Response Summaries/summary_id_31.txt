Original Response: 
If your `responses` package is located in another folder within your IntelliJ project, you need to ensure that the folder containing the `responses` package is marked as a source folder in IntelliJ.
Follow these steps to configure it properly:

1.
**Mark the folder as a source folder**:
   - Right-click on the folder containing the `responses` package in the Project Explorer pane.
- Select "Mark Directory as" > "Sources Root".
2.
**Adjust package imports**:
   - If your `signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java` files are in a different package than `responses`, you'll need to adjust the import statements to reflect the correct package hierarchy.
For example, if `responses` is located at `src/main/java/responses`, and `signedInUI.java` and `serverFacade.java` are in `src/main/java/ui`, you would import classes from `responses` like this:



3.
**Rebuild your project**:
   - After making these changes, rebuild your project to ensure that IntelliJ recognizes the updated project structure.
By marking the folder containing the `responses` package as a source root, IntelliJ will include it in the compilation process, and your classes should be able to access the classes and packages within it.
If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

Summary: 
- Select "Mark Directory as" > "Sources Root".
