If you run the download code multiple times, the file will be downloaded each time you run it.
To avoid this and ensure that you download the file only if it doesn't already exist, you can add a check to see if the file is already present in the local directory before attempting to download it.
Here's how you can modify the script to include this check:


1.
**Mount Google Drive**:
   

2.
**Install Required Libraries**:
   

3.
**Check if the File Exists Before Downloading**:


Hereâ€™s the full code with the file existence check:


1.
**Mount Google Drive**: Ensure Google Drive is mounted.
2.
**Install gdown**: Install the `gdown` library to handle the file download.
3.
**Check for File Existence**: Use `os.path.exists()` to check if the file already exists locally.
If it does not exist, download the file using `gdown.download()`.
If it does exist, skip the download step.
4.
**Read the File**: Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to verify successful loading.
By incorporating the existence check, you avoid redundant downloads, making the process more efficient.

Summary: 
If it does exist, skip the download step.
If it does not exist, download the file using `gdown.download()`.
