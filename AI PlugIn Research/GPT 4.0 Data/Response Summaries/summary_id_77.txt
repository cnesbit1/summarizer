Original Response: 
If your tests require the handler class to be annotated with `@WebSocket`, and you're facing issues with the handler not being activated, there might be some misconfiguration or other issues causing the problem.
Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1.
**Verify Test Configuration**: Ensure that your test environment is correctly set up to initialize and activate the WebSocket handler class.
This includes any test-specific configurations or setups that might be necessary to enable WebSocket functionality.
2.
**Check Test Dependencies**: Make sure that all required dependencies for WebSocket testing are included and properly configured in your test environment.
This includes any WebSocket client libraries or testing frameworks that you might be using.
3.
**Inspect Test Code**: Review your test code to ensure that the WebSocket connection is being established correctly and that messages are being sent/received as expected.
Look for any errors or exceptions that might indicate issues with the WebSocket setup or message processing.
4.
**Debugging**: Use debugging techniques to step through your test code and WebSocket handler class to identify where the problem might be occurring.
Check for any conditions or code paths that might prevent the handler from being activated.
5.
**Mocking Dependencies**: If your WebSocket handler class depends on other components or services, consider mocking these dependencies in your tests to isolate the behavior of the handler class.
This can help identify whether the issue lies with the handler class itself or its dependencies.
6.
**Logging**: Add logging statements to your WebSocket handler class and test code to trace the execution flow and debug any issues.
Logging can provide valuable insights into the behavior of your code and help identify the root cause of the problem.
7.
**Consult Documentation and Examples**: Refer to the documentation and examples provided for the WebSocket library or framework you're using, as well as any testing frameworks or tools.
These resources may contain helpful tips or troubleshooting steps specific to your setup.
By carefully reviewing your test configuration, code, and dependencies, and using debugging techniques as needed, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with your WebSocket handler class not being activated in your tests.

Summary: 
This can help identify whether the issue lies with the handler class itself or its dependencies.
This includes any WebSocket client libraries or testing frameworks that you might be using.
Check for any conditions or code paths that might prevent the handler from being activated.
