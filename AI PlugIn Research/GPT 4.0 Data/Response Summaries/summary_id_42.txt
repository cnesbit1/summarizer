Original Response: 
If there is no copy constructor or a method specifically designed to create a copy of the `ChessGame` object, you can still create a shallow copy using the assignment operator (`=`).
However, please note that with the assignment operator, you'll create a new reference to the same object, not a new object with copied state.
This means changes made to one object will affect the other.
If you need to ensure that changes made to one `ChessGame` object do not affect the other, you'll need to implement a method for deep copying or provide a copy constructor.
Here's how you can create a shallow copy using the assignment operator:



If you need a deep copy, you have a few options:

1.
**Implement a Copy Method**: Implement a method within the `ChessGame` class to create a new instance of `ChessGame` with copied state.
This method can manually copy each field or delegate to other methods that perform the copy.
2.
**Use Serialization**: Serialize the `ChessGame` object to a byte stream and then deserialize it back into a new object.
This approach creates a deep copy of the object, including all its fields.
3.
**Use Third-Party Libraries**: Consider using third-party libraries like Apache Commons Lang or Google Gson, which provide utility methods for deep copying objects.
Here's an example of using serialization to create a deep copy:



Remember to handle exceptions appropriately when working with serialization.
Also, ensure that all classes involved in serialization implement the `Serializable` interface.

Summary: 
This means changes made to one object will affect the other.
This approach creates a deep copy of the object, including all its fields.
