Original Response: 
To properly implement the `joinPlayer` method in your `serverFacade` class, you need to provide it with the necessary parameters and create a `JoinRequestData` object to send to the server.
Here's how you can modify your `joinPlayer` method:



In this method:

1.
You create a `JoinRequestData` object with the provided `authToken`, `gameID`, and `playerColor`.
2.
Using Gson, you convert the `JoinRequestData` object into JSON format.
3.
You then send the JSON data to the server via WebSocket using the `sendMessage` method of the `webConn` object (assuming `webConn` is an instance of your `connectionWebSocket` class).
Make sure that the `webConn` object is properly initialized and connected to the WebSocket server before calling this method.
Additionally, handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the WebSocket communication.

Summary: 
Using Gson, you convert the `JoinRequestData` object into JSON format.
