You can add a method named `checkEmpty` to the `ChessBoard` class to iterate through every element in the board and check if they are all null.

In this method:

- We iterate through every element in the `squares` array.
- If we find a non-null piece at any position, we return `false` immediately, indicating that the board is not empty.
- If we iterate through the entire board without finding any non-null piece, we return `true`, indicating that the board is empty.
