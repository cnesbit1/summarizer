Original Response: 
No, the formula \((4 - (W \times 3) \mod 4) \mod 4\) and \(W \mod 4\) do not give the same value, and they serve different purposes.
Let's break down each formula and clarify their differences:


This formula is specifically designed to calculate the amount of padding needed at the end of each row in a BMP file where each pixel is represented by 3 bytes (for the RGB values):

- **\(W \times 3\)**: This calculates the total number of bytes used by pixels in a single row.
- **\((W \times 3) \mod 4\)**: This finds how many bytes over a multiple of 4 the row length is.
This is the remainder when the row's byte length is divided by 4.
- **\(4 - (W \times 3) \mod 4\)**: This calculates how many bytes are needed to reach the next multiple of 4.
If the row is already a multiple of 4, this calculation yields 4.
- **\((4 - (W \times 3) \mod 4) \mod 4\)**: Taking the result modulo 4 adjusts the previous step, making it 0 if the row is already a multiple of 4 (since we don't need additional bytes in that case).
If \(W = 10\):
- \(W \times 3 = 30\)
- \(30 \mod 4 = 2\) (2 bytes over a multiple of 4)
- \(4 - 2 = 2\) (2 more bytes needed to reach the next multiple of 4)
- \(2 \mod 4 = 2\) (the final padding needed)


This formula simply calculates the remainder when \(W\) is divided by 4.
It does not consider how the bytes are arranged or needed in terms of pixel data in a BMP file.
This calculation might be used in other contexts but doesn't suit the padding calculation for a 24-bit BMP file.
If \(W = 10\):
- \(10 \mod 4 = 2\) (which tells us nothing about the bytes or padding needed for alignment in a BMP context)

These two formulas serve very different purposes.
The first is specifically tailored for calculating padding needed to align BMP file rows to a 4-byte boundary, considering that each pixel occupies 3 bytes.
The second is a general modulus operation that doesn't consider the specific needs of BMP file formatting.

Summary: 
This is the remainder when the row's byte length is divided by 4.
