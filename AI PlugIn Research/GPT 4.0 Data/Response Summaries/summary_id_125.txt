Sure, I can help you organize your libraries in a way that is intuitive and easy to read.
Here's a general approach to organizing imports in Python, which follows best practices and PEP 8 guidelines.
1.
**Standard Library Imports**: These should come first and be grouped together.
2.
**Related Third-Party Imports**: Follow standard library imports and should be grouped together.
3.
**Local Application Imports**: These should come last.
Within each group, imports should be alphabetized.
Let's say you have the following libraries to import:

- Standard libraries: `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `time`
- Third-party libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`
- Local application imports: `my_module`, `my_other_module`

Here's how you can organize them:


Let's create a more detailed example.
Suppose you're working on a data analysis project and need the following imports:

- Standard libraries: `os`, `sys`, `datetime`, `json`
- Third-party libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`
- Local application imports: `data_loader`, `data_processor`, `visualization_utils`

Here's how you can organize them:


For better readability, you can add comments to separate different sections and group related imports:


Organizing imports in this structured manner makes your code easier to read and maintain.
By following these guidelines, you ensure a clear and intuitive organization that helps both you and others who may work on your code in the future.

Summary: 
Within each group, imports should be alphabetized.
