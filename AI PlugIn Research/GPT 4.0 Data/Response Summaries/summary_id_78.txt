Original Response: 
To finish the code for the `add` method in the `ConnectionManager` class, you need to handle two scenarios:

1.
If there are no connections for the specified `gameID`, you need to create a new collection of connections and add the new connection to it.
2.
If there are existing connections for the specified `gameID`, you need to add the new connection to the existing collection.
Here's how you can implement these scenarios:



This code first retrieves the collection of connections associated with the specified `gameID`.
If there are no connections (`gameConnections == null`), it creates a new `ArrayList` to store connections for that gameID and adds it to the `connections` map.
Then, it adds the new connection to the collection.
If there are existing connections for the `gameID`, it simply adds the new connection to the existing collection.

Summary: 
Then, it adds the new connection to the collection.
