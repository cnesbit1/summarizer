Original Response: 
Yes, carbon monoxide (CO) inhibits the transport of oxygen (O2) in the blood by binding to hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that normally carries oxygen.
CO has a much greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen—approximately 200 to 250 times greater.
This strong affinity allows carbon monoxide to effectively compete with oxygen for binding sites on the hemoglobin molecule.
When CO binds to hemoglobin, it forms a compound known as carboxyhemoglobin, which reduces the amount of hemoglobin available to transport oxygen.
This interference limits the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, resulting in reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and organs throughout the body.
The reduction in oxygen availability can lead to symptoms of hypoxia and, in severe cases, can cause organ dysfunction and life-threatening conditions.
The binding of CO to hemoglobin also affects the ability of the remaining oxygen-bound hemoglobin to release oxygen into body tissues.
CO alters the hemoglobin molecule in a way that increases its affinity for oxygen, making it less likely to release oxygen at tissue sites.
This further decreases the effective oxygen supply to cells, compounding the hypoxic effects caused by reduced oxygen transportation.
Overall, the presence of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream significantly impairs oxygen transport and delivery, leading to various symptoms and potential health risks associated with CO poisoning.

Summary: 
CO has a much greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen—approximately 200 to 250 times greater.
