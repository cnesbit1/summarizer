Original Response: 
It seems that the methods `getConnection`, `join`, `observe`, `move`, `leave`, `resign`, and `sendError` are not defined within the `webSocketHandler` class.
You need to define these methods or import them from other classes where they are implemented.
Here's what you need to do:

1.
Define or import the `getConnection`, `join`, `observe`, `move`, `leave`, `resign`, and `sendError` methods in your `webSocketHandler` class.
2.
Ensure that these methods are accessible and properly implemented to handle the WebSocket communication logic.
If these methods are supposed to be part of your application's logic, you'll need to implement them within the `webSocketHandler` class or import them from other classes where they are defined.
If they are part of a separate class or service, make sure to import them into your `webSocketHandler` class.
