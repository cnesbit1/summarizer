Original Response: 
Exposure to high concentrations of pollutants such as CO (carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) can have significant detrimental effects on cells and overall health.
Hereâ€™s how each of these pollutants can affect cellular function and health:

- **Hemoglobin Binding**: CO has a high affinity for hemoglobin, more than 200 times that of oxygen, forming carboxyhemoglobin.
This reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and cells, causing hypoxia (oxygen deprivation at the cellular level).
Chronic exposure can lead to severe cardiovascular and neurological effects.
- **Cellular Respiration Impact**: At the cellular level, reduced oxygen availability can impair mitochondrial function, crucial for energy production, leading to reduced cellular energy (ATP) levels and affecting cellular functions.
- **Acid-Base Balance**: While typically not directly toxic, in high concentrations, CO2 can lead to an increase in blood acidity (respiratory acidosis) as it dissolves in blood forming carbonic acid.
This acidosis can interfere with enzymes and cellular functions and affect the nervous system, potentially leading to confusion and decreased reflexes.
- **Oxidative Stress**: NO2 is highly reactive and can cause oxidative damage to cells.
It reacts with water to form nitric acid, contributing to acidified cells and tissues.
NO2 can also lead to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, and DNA.
- **Inflammatory Response**: Exposure to NO2 can trigger an inflammatory response in the respiratory system, damaging the epithelial cells lining the airways and compromising the immune defenses.
- **Deep Lung Penetration**: Fine particles, especially PM2.5, are small enough to bypass the nose and throat's natural defenses (mucus and cilia) and penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.
- **Systemic Effects**: Once in the bloodstream, particulates can cause systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, which can affect various organs and lead to chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease, respiratory infections, and even lung cancer.
- **Direct Cellular Effects**: Particles can directly affect lung cells, leading to decreased lung function, increased permeability of the lung epithelium, and impaired gas exchange.
When cells are exposed to higher-than-average concentrations of these pollutants:
- **Cellular Stress and Damage**: Cells can undergo stress and damage due to oxidative stress and direct toxic effects of pollutants.
- **Inflammatory Signaling**: There can be an increase in inflammatory signaling, leading to systemic inflammation.
- **DNA Damage and Mutations**: Oxidative stress can lead to DNA damage, mutations, and potentially cancer.
- **Impaired Cellular Functions**: Critical cellular functions, including respiration, signaling, and metabolic processes, can be impaired.
Given these effects, reducing exposure to these pollutants is crucial, especially during events like wildfires where concentrations of these harmful substances can significantly exceed safe levels.

Summary: 
Chronic exposure can lead to severe cardiovascular and neurological effects.
- **Oxidative Stress**: NO2 is highly reactive and can cause oxidative damage to cells.
