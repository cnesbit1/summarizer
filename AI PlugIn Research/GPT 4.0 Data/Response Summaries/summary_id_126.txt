Certainly!
Let's organize the imports and other commands in a more structured and readable manner.
We will follow these steps:

1.
**Standard Library Imports**: Group standard library imports together.
2.
**Third-Party Library Imports**: Group third-party library imports together.
3.
**Local Imports and Setup**: Include any commands for setting up the environment, downloading data, or configuring settings.
4.
**Functions and Classes**: Define any functions, classes, or initializations.
Here's the organized version:


1.
**Standard Library Imports**: These are placed at the top, ensuring basic dependencies are available.
2.
**Third-Party Library Imports**: Grouped below standard libraries and alphabetically sorted.
3.
**Environment Setup**: Commands that are intended to run in the interactive environment (like `pip install` and model downloads) are commented out but placed in the order they should be executed.
4.
**Initialization**: Any initializations or configurations are placed at the end.
This organized structure ensures clarity and maintainability, making it easy to see at a glance what libraries and configurations are necessary for your script.

Summary: 
Here's the organized version:


1.
**Standard Library Imports**: Group standard library imports together.
