Original Response: 
In set theory and formal language theory:

- {a, b} denotes a set containing the elements 'a' and 'b'.
- {a, b}* denotes the Kleene closure of the set {a, b}, which means it represents all possible strings that can be formed by concatenating zero or more occurrences of 'a' and 'b'.
In other words, {a, b}* includes the empty string, 'a', 'b', 'aa', 'ab', 'ba', 'bb', 'aaa', 'aab', 'aba', 'abb', 'baa', 'bab', 'bba', 'bbb', and so on.
So, while {a, b} represents just the set containing 'a' and 'b', {a, b}* represents all possible combinations of 'a' and 'b', including the empty string.
