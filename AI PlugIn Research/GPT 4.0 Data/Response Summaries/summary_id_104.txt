Original Response: 
The language {a^ib^i | 0 <= i <= 50} consists of strings of the form "a^i b^i" where the number of 'a's is equal to the number of 'b's and 'i' can vary from 0 to 50.
To design a Turing Machine to accept this language, we need to check that for every 'a' encountered, there is a corresponding 'b' later in the input.
This process can be completed in linear time by scanning the input string once.
Here's a rough description of the Turing Machine:

1.
Start in the initial state q0.
2.
Read the input symbol by symbol.
3.
If the symbol is 'a', move to state q1.
4.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, move to state q2.
5.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
6.
If the symbol is blank (indicating the end of the input) and the machine is in state q1 or q2, accept the string.
7.
If the symbol is neither 'a' nor 'b' and the machine is in state q0, reject the string.
8.
If the symbol is neither 'a' nor 'b' and the machine is in state q1 or q2, reject the string.
The time complexity of this Turing Machine is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
This is because the machine scans the input tape once and performs a constant number of operations for each input symbol, resulting in linear time complexity.
Since the maximum length of the input string is bounded by 50 (i.e., "a" appears at most 50 times), the time complexity is O(50) which simplifies to O(1).
Therefore, the time complexity of the Turing Machine is effectively O(1).

Summary: 
If the symbol is 'a', move to state q1.
Read the input symbol by symbol.
Start in the initial state q0.
