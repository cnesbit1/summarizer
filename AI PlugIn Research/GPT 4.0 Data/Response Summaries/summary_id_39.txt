Original Response: 
The compilation error you're encountering (`package responses does not exist`) suggests that the compiler cannot find the `responses` package.
This typically occurs when the package or class you're trying to import (`ListGames`) is not accessible due to one of the following reasons:

1.
**Missing Dependency**:
   - If `ListGames` is defined in a separate module or library, ensure that your project has a dependency on that module or library.
You need to include the JAR file or the dependency in your `pom.xml` (for Maven) or `build.gradle` (for Gradle) file.
2.
**Incorrect Package Structure**:
   - Double-check that the `responses` package is structured correctly within your project directory.
It should be located in a directory named `responses` under the `src/main/java` directory.
- Ensure that the package declaration in the `ListGames` class matches the directory structure.
For example, if `ListGames` is in the `responses` package, the package declaration should be `package responses;`.
3.
**Compile-Time Error in Dependencies**:
   - If there are any compile-time errors in the dependencies (such as missing classes or unresolved dependencies), it can prevent the compiler from resolving the `ListGames` class.
- Make sure that the dependencies are correctly configured and that all required classes are available.
4.
**IntelliJ IDEA Configuration**:
   - Sometimes, IntelliJ IDEA may not synchronize properly with the project configuration, especially after changes.
Try syncing your project with IntelliJ IDEA by refreshing Gradle or reimporting Maven dependencies.
- You can also try invalidating caches and restarting IntelliJ IDEA (`File` > `Invalidate Caches / Restart...`).
5.
**Check Visibility and Access Modifiers**:
   - Ensure that the `ListGames` class and other classes/packages in the `responses` package have the appropriate visibility modifiers (`public`, `protected`, or package-private) to be accessed from other packages.
By addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the compilation error and successfully compile your code.
If you're still encountering issues, please provide additional details or code snippets for further assistance.

Summary: 
- Ensure that the package declaration in the `ListGames` class matches the directory structure.
For example, if `ListGames` is in the `responses` package, the package declaration should be `package responses;`.
- Make sure that the dependencies are correctly configured and that all required classes are available.
