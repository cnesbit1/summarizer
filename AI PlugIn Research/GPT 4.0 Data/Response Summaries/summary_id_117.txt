Original Response: 
Let's describe and analyze the data you provided for Kristen at each specific time period, using the relevant biological terms and explaining the mechanisms involved.
- **Data Description**: The baseline blood glucose level is 84 mg/dL.
- **Biological Mechanisms**: At this fasting baseline (having not eaten overnight), Kristen’s blood glucose level is maintained by the balance of insulin and glucagon, hormones secreted by the pancreas.
Her glucose level is within the normal fasting range, indicating effective basal insulin secretion that helps cells take up glucose and limits hepatic glucose production.
The glucose transporters (mainly GLUT4) on cell membranes in muscle and adipose tissues are stimulated by insulin to help clear glucose from the blood, maintaining a stable concentration gradient across the cell membrane.
- **Data Description**: Kristen’s blood glucose levels increase from 84 mg/dL to a peak of 115 mg/dL.
- **Biological Mechanisms**: After consuming turkey meat, the protein content stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas.
The increase in insulin in the blood causes more glucose transporters to move to the cell membranes, facilitating the uptake of any circulating glucose into cells.
However, protein also causes the release of glucagon, which can stimulate gluconeogenesis (creation of new glucose) in the liver, contributing to an increase in blood glucose levels.
The observed rise in blood glucose can also be attributed to a minor extent to the breakdown of protein into amino acids, which can be converted into glucose via gluconeogenesis.
- **Data Description**: After reaching a peak at 115 mg/dL, the glucose level starts fluctuating, reaching a secondary peak of 132 mg/dL at 25 minutes and then declining to 104 mg/dL by 35 minutes.
- **Biological Mechanisms**: The fluctuations and secondary peak suggest a dynamic interplay between insulin and glucagon effects.
Initially, insulin's effect might dominate, promoting glucose uptake and temporarily reducing blood glucose levels.
However, as the effect of glucagon becomes more pronounced, it counters the action of insulin by stimulating more glucose release from the liver.
This can lead to a temporary secondary peak in blood glucose levels.
As the protein’s influence tapers off and the pancreas continues to release insulin in response to any circulating glucose, glucose levels begin to stabilize and return towards baseline levels.
Throughout these periods, the concentration of glucose in the blood is a critical factor driving the secretion of insulin and the activity of glucose transporters across cell membranes.
The insulin receptors on cell surfaces play a crucial role in detecting the presence of insulin, triggering a cascade of intracellular reactions that ultimately increase glucose uptake from the blood into cells, thereby reducing blood glucose levels.
This detailed response helps in understanding how different components of metabolism interact in response to food intake and how the body manages to maintain blood glucose levels within a relatively narrow range, despite fluctuations in dietary intake and metabolic demands.

Summary: 
- **Data Description**: The baseline blood glucose level is 84 mg/dL.
This can lead to a temporary secondary peak in blood glucose levels.
