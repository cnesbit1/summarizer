Concurrency issues in a Java application, especially in network-based games like a chess server and client, can be challenging.
These issues typically arise when multiple threads try to access shared resources simultaneously, leading to race conditions, deadlocks, or inconsistent data states.
Here are some general strategies and specific approaches you might consider to resolve these issues:

   - **Monitor Locks (synchronized keyword)**: Use `synchronized` blocks or methods to ensure that only one thread can execute a block of code at a time.
- **Lock Objects (ReentrantLock)**: More flexible than synchronized blocks, allowing you to try to acquire the lock without blocking indefinitely.
- Use thread-safe variants of collections from `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, etc., to manage shared data.
- Use atomic variables from `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package for counters, flags, and other simple values to avoid synchronization for these specific types of shared data.
- Design immutable objects that do not need defensive copies because their state cannot change after creation.
This can reduce synchronization needs.
- Be cautious about the order in which locks are acquired and always acquire them in a consistent order.
- Consider using `tryLock` with a timeout to avoid holding onto a lock for too long.
- Manage threads efficiently by using executors from the `java.util.concurrent` package which handle thread pooling and task scheduling.
- Use tools such as VisualVM, JConsole, or your IDEâ€™s debugging features to monitor threads, view locks, and detect deadlocks.
- Write unit tests that simulate high concurrency to try to trigger race conditions or other issues.
- Use libraries designed for concurrency testing like JCTools or JCStress.
Implementing these strategies requires a detailed understanding of your application's architecture and the specific concurrency issues you're facing.
If you have specific code examples or scenarios where the concurrency issue is manifesting, I can provide more targeted advice.

Summary: 
This can reduce synchronization needs.
- Use libraries designed for concurrency testing like JCTools or JCStress.
