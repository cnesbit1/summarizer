Sure, let's revise your code to address the stack overflow issue by separating the logic for checkmate and stalemate from the logic for making moves:



In this revision:

- The `makeMove` method now checks for the end of the game (`checkForEndGame`) after each move.
- `checkForEndGame` method checks for both checkmate and stalemate conditions.
- The logic for simulating the move on a temporary board and checking for leaving the king in check is encapsulated in the `simulateBoardWithMove` method.
- The logic for updating the actual board with the move is encapsulated in the `updateBoardWithMove` method.
- The `switchTurn` method switches the turn after each move.
- Other methods and fields remain unchanged, ensuring the integrity of the existing functionality.
