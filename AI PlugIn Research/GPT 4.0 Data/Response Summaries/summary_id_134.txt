The `quiet` parameter in the `gdown.download()` function controls whether the download progress is displayed to the user.
When `quiet=False`, it means that the download progress will be shown, allowing you to see the progress of the file download.
This can be useful for providing feedback, especially when downloading large files, so you know the download is proceeding.
Here’s a detailed explanation:


- **`quiet=False`**: 
  - When set to `False`, the function will print messages and show the download progress bar.
This is useful for monitoring the status of the download and getting feedback on how much of the file has been downloaded.
- Example:
    
  - Output Example:
    

- **`quiet=True`**:
  - When set to `True`, the function will suppress all output, including the progress bar.
This can make your notebook output cleaner, especially if you do not need to monitor the download progress.
- Example:
    
  - Output Example:
    (No output will be shown)


- **Use `quiet=False`**:
  - When you want to see the progress of the download.
- When downloading large files and you want to monitor how much has been downloaded.
- For debugging purposes to ensure the download is occurring as expected.
- **Use `quiet=True`**:
  - When you want to minimize the amount of output in your notebook.
- When running the notebook in a production environment where you don't need to see the progress.
- To make the notebook output cleaner, especially if you have multiple download operations.
Here’s how it fits into the complete script:



By setting `quiet=False`, you will see the download progress and any messages related to the download process, which can be very helpful for monitoring and debugging.

Summary: 
- When downloading large files and you want to monitor how much has been downloaded.
- **Use `quiet=True`**:
  - When you want to minimize the amount of output in your notebook.
