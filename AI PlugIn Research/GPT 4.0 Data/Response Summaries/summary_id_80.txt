To start the MySQL shell, you can use the `mysql` command followed by the necessary options such as specifying the username, password, and hostname.
Here's a basic command to start the MySQL shell:



Replace `your_username` with your MySQL username.
After running this command, you'll be prompted to enter your MySQL password.
Once authenticated, you'll be in the MySQL shell where you can start executing SQL commands.
If MySQL is not in your system PATH, you may need to provide the full path to the `mysql` executable.
On Unix-like systems, the command might look like this:



Make sure to replace `/usr/bin/mysql` with the actual path to the `mysql` executable on your system.
Additionally, if you want to connect to a MySQL server running on a different host, you can specify the hostname with the `-h` option:



Replace `hostname` with the hostname or IP address of the MySQL server you want to connect to.
After running one of these commands, you should see the MySQL shell prompt, indicating that you are now connected to the MySQL server and can start executing SQL queries.

Summary: 
After running this command, you'll be prompted to enter your MySQL password.
