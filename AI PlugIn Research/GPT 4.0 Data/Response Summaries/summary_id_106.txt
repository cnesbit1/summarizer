Original Response: 
In a two-tape Turing Machine (TM), each transition counts as a single operation regardless of the number of tapes involved.
The time complexity, denoted as tcM(n), still represents the number of transitions performed by the TM on an input of size n.

Here's why a transition in a two-tape TM should not be counted twice:

1.
**Synchronous Operation:** In a two-tape TM, both tapes are read and/or written to synchronously during each transition.
That is, a single transition involves reading from or writing to both tapes simultaneously as part of a single step in the computation.
2.
**Definition of Time Complexity:** Time complexity typically measures the number of elementary computational steps required to solve a problem as a function of the input size.
In the case of a TM, these steps correspond to transitions between states.
3.
**Consistency with Single-Tape TM:** Counting each transition only once maintains consistency with the convention used for single-tape TMs.
Whether a TM has one tape or multiple tapes, the time complexity metric remains consistent, allowing for meaningful comparisons between different models of computation.
Therefore, in the analysis of time complexity for a two-tape TM, each transition is counted only once, regardless of the number of tapes involved.

Summary: 
In the case of a TM, these steps correspond to transitions between states.
