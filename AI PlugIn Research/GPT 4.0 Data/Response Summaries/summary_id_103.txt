Original Response: 
Let's address each part of the question:

(a) Design of a Turing Machine M that accepts language L:
- The Turing Machine M should accept strings that satisfy either condition (i) or condition (ii).
- For strings satisfying condition (i), the Turing Machine needs to ensure that they are in the form "aib" with the length not exceeding 100.
- For strings satisfying condition (ii), the Turing Machine should accept any string with a length greater than 100.
- Here's a rough design of Turing Machine M:
  1.
Start in the initial state q0.
2.
Read the input string one symbol at a time.
3.
If the symbol is 'a', transition to state q1.
4.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
5.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
6.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
7.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q0, transition to state q2.
8.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
9.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
10.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
11.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
12.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
13.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
14.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
15.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
16.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
17.
If the length exceeds 100 and the machine is in state q0 or q1, accept the string.
18.
If the length does not exceed 100 and the machine is in state q2, accept the string.
19.
If the length exceeds 100 and the machine is in state q2, accept the string.
20.
If none of the conditions are met, reject the string.
(b) Function tcM:
- The function tcM(n) denotes the time complexity of Turing Machine M on an input of size n.
- Since the machine scans the input tape once and performs a constant number of operations for each input symbol, the time complexity of the machine is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
(c) Best polynomial rate of growth for tcM:
- The best polynomial rate of growth that describes tcM is O(n), as determined in part (b).
This means that the time complexity of the machine grows linearly with the size of the input string.

Summary: 
If the symbol is 'a', transition to state q1.
Start in the initial state q0.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
Read the input string one symbol at a time.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, transition to state q2.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q0, transition to state q2.
