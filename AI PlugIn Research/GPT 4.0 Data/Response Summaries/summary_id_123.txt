Original Response: 
Yes, the pancreas does produce glucagon.
Glucagon is a hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets, which are clusters of cells in the pancreas.
This hormone plays a critical role in glucose metabolism, particularly in regulating blood glucose levels.
- **Function**: Glucagon's primary function is to raise blood glucose levels when they drop too low (hypoglycemia).
It does this by signaling the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, a process known as glycogenolysis.
Glucagon also promotes the production of new glucose through gluconeogenesis, which occurs mainly in the liver using amino acids, lactate, and glycerol.
- **Regulation**: Glucagon secretion is typically stimulated by low blood glucose levels and is inhibited by high blood glucose levels.
It works in tandem with insulin, which is produced by the beta cells of the pancreatic islets.
While insulin lowers blood glucose levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells and the storage of glucose as glycogen, glucagon works to increase glucose levels, thereby maintaining a balance in blood glucose homeostasis.
The coordinated actions of insulin and glucagon ensure that the body maintains stable blood glucose levels, which is crucial for proper brain function and overall energy metabolism.

Summary: 
Yes, the pancreas does produce glucagon.
