Original Response: 
Continual exposure to high levels of insulin can lead to several physiological changes affecting both blood glucose levels and cellular uptake of glucose.
Hereâ€™s how these processes typically unfold:

1.
**Increased Glucose Uptake**: Insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, particularly muscle cells and adipose (fat) tissue.
It does this by promoting the translocation of glucose transporter proteins (such as GLUT4) to the cell membrane, which increases glucose uptake from the bloodstream into the cells.
2.
**Decreased Blood Glucose Levels**: As more glucose is taken up by cells, the concentration of glucose in the blood decreases.
This is the primary mechanism by which insulin helps lower blood glucose levels after a meal.
3.
**Insulin Sensitivity and Resistance**: However, when cells are continually exposed to high levels of insulin, a phenomenon known as insulin resistance can develop.
This means that the cells become less responsive to insulin.
In the early stages, the body may compensate by producing more insulin, but over time, this can strain the pancreas and eventually impair its ability to produce insulin.
4.
**Metabolic Changes**: If insulin resistance develops, the normal response to insulin is blunted.
Cells do not absorb glucose as efficiently, leading to higher blood glucose levels despite the presence of high insulin levels.
This scenario is a common precursor to type 2 diabetes.
5.
**Feedback Mechanisms and Adaptations**: The body may try to compensate for high insulin and the resultant insulin resistance by altering the expression of insulin receptors and the glucose transporters.
Additionally, prolonged high insulin levels can affect other metabolic pathways, influencing lipid metabolism and increasing the risk of fat accumulation, particularly in the liver.
In summary, while the initial effect of high insulin levels is to lower blood glucose by enhancing its uptake into cells, chronic exposure to high insulin can lead to insulin resistance, reduced cellular uptake of glucose, and potentially higher blood glucose levels over time.
This emphasizes the importance of maintaining normal insulin levels and sensitivity to prevent metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.

Summary: 
This means that the cells become less responsive to insulin.
**Metabolic Changes**: If insulin resistance develops, the normal response to insulin is blunted.
This scenario is a common precursor to type 2 diabetes.
