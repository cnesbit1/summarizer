The specific chemicals in an iodine solution can vary depending on the type of solution and its intended use.
Here are common types of iodine solutions and their chemical components:

1.
**Tincture of Iodine**:
   - **Iodine (I2)**: The elemental form of iodine, acting as the primary active ingredient.
- **Ethanol (C2H5OH)**: Used as a solvent to dissolve the iodine.
- **Water (H2O)**: Often included to dilute the solution.
- This solution is typically used as a disinfectant and antiseptic.
2.
**Lugol's Solution** (also known as Iodine-Potassium Iodide Solution):
   - **Iodine (I2)**
   - **Potassium Iodide (KI)**: Acts as a stabilizer and increases the solubility of iodine in water.
- **Water (H2O)**: The solvent for both iodine and potassium iodide.
- Lugol's solution is used both medically and as a reagent in laboratories.
3.
**Povidone-Iodine** (commonly known as Betadine):
   - **Povidone-Iodine (C6H9NO)nÂ·xI**: A complex of iodine with a solubilizing agent, povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone), which releases iodine slowly.
- **Water (H2O)**: Used as the base of the solution.
- This formulation is widely used as a topical antiseptic in surgeries and for minor wounds.
4.
**Iodophor Solutions**:
   - **Iodine**
   - **A surfactant or polymer**: Acts as a carrier and stabilizer for iodine.
- **Water (H2O)**
   - These are disinfectants used in medical settings and also in the dairy and food industries.
Each type of iodine solution has its specific formulation tailored to its application, ensuring effective delivery and stability of iodine.

Summary: 
- **Water (H2O)**: Used as the base of the solution.
- This solution is typically used as a disinfectant and antiseptic.
