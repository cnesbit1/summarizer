Original Response: 
Sure, I'll demonstrate how to use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of the superclass in the subclasses:

1.
Modifying the `Dog` class to call the constructor of the `Animal` superclass using `super()`:



2.
Since the `Car` and `Bicycle` classes don't extend any class, there's no need to explicitly call `super()`.
But just to show how `super()` would look:



Now, when you create instances of these classes, the constructors of the superclass (if applicable) will be invoked first before the constructors of the subclasses:



This example demonstrates how to use `super()` to call the constructor of the superclass from the subclass constructors in Java.
