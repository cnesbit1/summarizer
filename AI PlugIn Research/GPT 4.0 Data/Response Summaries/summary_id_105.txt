Original Response: 
Apologies for the oversight.
Let's correct that.
If we want the Turing Machine to reject strings with a length greater than or equal to 100, we need to add a check for this condition.
Here's the updated description of the Turing Machine:

1.
Start in the initial state q0.
2.
Read the input symbol by symbol.
3.
If the symbol is 'a', move to state q1.
4.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q1, move to state q2.
5.
If the symbol is 'b' and the machine is in state q2, stay in state q2.
6.
If the symbol is blank (indicating the end of the input) and the machine is in state q1 or q2:
    a.
If the length of the input is greater than or equal to 100, reject the string.
b.
If the length of the input is less than 100, accept the string.
7.
If the symbol is neither 'a' nor 'b' and the machine is in state q0, reject the string.
8.
If the symbol is neither 'a' nor 'b' and the machine is in state q1 or q2, reject the string.
This modification ensures that the Turing Machine rejects any string with a length greater than or equal to 100.
The time complexity remains O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as the machine still scans the input tape once and performs a constant number of operations for each input symbol.

Summary: 
If the symbol is 'a', move to state q1.
Read the input symbol by symbol.
Start in the initial state q0.
