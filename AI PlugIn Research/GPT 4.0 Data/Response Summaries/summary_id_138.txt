Insulin resistance and diabetes are closely related but are not the same condition.
Here's how they differ and how they are interconnected:

Insulin resistance is a condition where the body's cells become less responsive to the hormone insulin, which regulates blood glucose levels.
In insulin resistance, despite the presence of insulin, cells do not effectively take up glucose from the blood.
This results in the body needing higher levels of insulin to help glucose enter cells.
Diabetes is a broader term for a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood glucose levels over a prolonged period.
There are several types of diabetes, with the most common being:

- **Type 1 Diabetes**: This form is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production.
It is not related to insulin resistance.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: This is the most common form and is directly related to insulin resistance.
In type 2 diabetes, the body initially becomes insulin resistant, and over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to overcome this resistance, leading to elevated blood glucose levels.
- **Gestational Diabetes**: This type occurs during pregnancy and is similar to type 2 diabetes in that it involves insulin resistance.
It usually resolves after pregnancy, but it increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
Insulin resistance is often a precursor to type 2 diabetes.
Initially, the pancreas compensates for insulin resistance by producing more insulin.
However, over time, this compensatory mechanism may fail, leading to insufficient insulin production or function, and thus high blood glucose levels that characterize type 2 diabetes.
In summary, while insulin resistance is a significant risk factor and component of type 2 diabetes, it is not itself diabetes.
Instead, it can be seen as a stage in the development of diabetes, particularly type 2.
Managing insulin resistance through lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, can help prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Summary: 
It is not related to insulin resistance.
Insulin resistance and diabetes are closely related but are not the same condition.
