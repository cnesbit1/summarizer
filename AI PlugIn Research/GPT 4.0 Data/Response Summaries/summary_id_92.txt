Original Response: 
To properly receive requests from the WebSocket server, you need to define methods annotated with `@OnMessage` in your `connectionWebSocket` class.
These methods will be invoked when the server sends messages to the client.
Here's how you can implement it:



In this class:

- The `@OnOpen` method is called when the WebSocket connection is established.
You can perform any necessary initialization tasks here.
- The `@OnClose` method is called when the WebSocket connection is closed.
You can perform cleanup tasks here.
- The `@OnMessage` method is called when the server sends a message to the client.
You can handle the incoming message in this method.
The `message` parameter contains the content of the received message.
Make sure to define appropriate logic inside the `onMessage` method to handle different types of messages sent by the server.

Summary: 
You can handle the incoming message in this method.
