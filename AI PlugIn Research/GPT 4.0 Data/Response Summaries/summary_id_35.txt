To clean and rebuild your project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can follow these steps:

1.
**Cleaning the Project**:
   - Go to the "Build" menu at the top of IntelliJ IDEA.
- Select "Clean Project" from the dropdown menu.
- Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut.
On Windows and Linux, it's usually `Ctrl + Shift + F9`, and on macOS, it's `Cmd + Shift + F9`.
2.
**Rebuilding the Project**:
   - After cleaning the project, you can trigger a rebuild by either:
     - Making a minor change in one of your source files (e.g., adding/removing whitespace) and saving the file.
IntelliJ IDEA will automatically rebuild the project.
- Manually initiating a build by going to the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Project".
The keyboard shortcut for this action is `Ctrl + F9` on Windows/Linux and `Cmd + F9` on macOS.
3.
**Viewing Build Output**:
   - During the build process, IntelliJ IDEA will display the progress in the "Build" tool window at the bottom of the screen.
You can click on this tool window to view detailed information about the build process, including any errors or warnings.
By performing these steps, you effectively clean the project to remove any compiled output and then rebuild it from scratch.
This can help resolve various compilation or dependency-related issues.
If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior during the build process, IntelliJ IDEA will provide feedback in the build output window to help you troubleshoot and address the issues.

Summary: 
IntelliJ IDEA will automatically rebuild the project.
- Select "Clean Project" from the dropdown menu.
