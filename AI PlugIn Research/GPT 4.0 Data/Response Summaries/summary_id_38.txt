To analyze dependencies in IntelliJ IDEA and identify unused or redundant dependencies, you can use the built-in "Dependency Analyzer" tool.
Here's how you can access and use it:

1.
**Open Dependency Analyzer**:
   - In IntelliJ IDEA, navigate to the "Maven" or "Gradle" tool window, depending on which build tool you're using for your project.
- Expand the "Lifecycle" or "Tasks" section to reveal a list of available tasks or goals.
- Look for a task or goal related to dependency analysis.
For Maven, it's usually named "dependency:analyze" or "dependency:analyze-only".
- Double-click on the task or goal to run it.
This will analyze your project's dependencies and display the results in the "Dependency Analyzer" tool window.
2.
**Review Dependency Analysis Results**:
   - After running the dependency analysis task, IntelliJ IDEA will open the "Dependency Analyzer" tool window, which displays a list of dependencies along with their usage status.
- Unused or redundant dependencies will be marked as such in the tool window.
- Review the list of dependencies and identify any that are marked as unused or redundant.
3.
**Remove Unused Dependencies**:
   - Once you've identified unused or redundant dependencies, you can safely remove them from your project.
- Open your `pom.xml` file if you're using Maven, or `build.gradle` file if you're using Gradle.
- Locate the dependencies that you want to remove and delete them from the XML/DSL configuration.
- Save the file.
4.
**Re-run Dependency Analysis (Optional)**:
   - If you've made changes to your dependencies, you can re-run the dependency analysis task to verify that the unused dependencies have been removed successfully.
- Repeat the steps above to re-run the dependency analysis task and review the updated results.
By using the "Dependency Analyzer" tool in IntelliJ IDEA, you can easily identify and remove unused or redundant dependencies from your project, helping to streamline your project's dependencies and improve overall maintainability.

Summary: 
- Unused or redundant dependencies will be marked as such in the tool window.
- Double-click on the task or goal to run it.
- Look for a task or goal related to dependency analysis.
