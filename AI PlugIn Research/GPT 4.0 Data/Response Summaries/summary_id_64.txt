If you're using web sockets to play a game, the server-side code (like the `MySQLDatabase` class you provided) primarily deals with managing the game state and data storage/retrieval.
It doesn't directly handle the movement of pieces on the game board or any real-time interactions between players.
Here's how you can approach implementing game logic with web sockets:

1.
**Client-Server Communication**: Use web sockets to establish a persistent connection between the client (e.g., a web browser) and the server.
This allows real-time bidirectional communication.
2.
**Game Logic**: Implement the game logic on the server side.
This includes managing the game state, validating moves, updating the game board, and determining game outcomes (win, lose, draw).
3.
**WebSocket Messages**: Define a protocol for exchanging messages between the client and server over the web socket connection.
These messages could include commands to move pieces, request game state updates, or handle other game-related actions.
4.
**Handling WebSocket Events**: In your server-side code, handle incoming messages from clients using WebSocket event handlers (e.g., `@OnWebSocketMessage`).
Parse the incoming messages to extract the relevant information and update the game state accordingly.
5.
**Sending Updates to Clients**: After processing a move or updating the game state, send updates to all connected clients using the web socket connection.
This allows all players to see the current game state in real-time.
6.
**Client-Side Rendering**: On the client side, implement logic to render the game board based on the updates received from the server.
This includes updating the positions of pieces, displaying game messages, and handling user interactions.
In summary, while the `MySQLDatabase` class handles data storage and retrieval, you'll need additional logic to handle real-time game interactions using web sockets.
This includes managing game state, validating moves, and updating clients with the latest game state.
The `MySQLDatabase` class may still be used to store and retrieve game data, but it's not directly involved in real-time game play.

Summary: 
**Game Logic**: Implement the game logic on the server side.
This allows real-time bidirectional communication.
This allows all players to see the current game state in real-time.
