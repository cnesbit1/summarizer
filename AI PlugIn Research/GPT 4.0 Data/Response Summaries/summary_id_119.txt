Original Response: 
Your observation raises a very relevant point about the physiological response to protein intake and the dual-phase pattern in blood glucose levels.
Let’s delve deeper into why there might be an initial slight rise in glucose followed by a more significant rise, even though protein itself doesn’t directly increase blood glucose levels like carbohydrates do.
The initial slight increase in blood glucose levels after consuming protein can be attributed to several factors:
- **Amino Acid Absorption**: As protein is digested, amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream.
Some amino acids can be used directly by the liver to produce glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis.
However, this process is generally slower and less direct compared to the breakdown of carbohydrates.
- **Insulin and Glucagon Release**: Protein intake stimulates the release of insulin to help cells absorb amino acids for protein synthesis.
Insulin also has the effect of lowering blood glucose levels.
However, protein also triggers the release of glucagon, which works to increase blood glucose levels by signaling the liver to release glucose.
This dual hormone response can cause a mild initial increase as the body balances these effects.
The more pronounced rise that follows could be due to:
- **Continued Gluconeogenesis**: Over time, the liver may increase gluconeogenesis as more amino acids become available and as the initial effects of insulin start to taper off relative to glucagon's influence.
This can lead to a delayed but more significant increase in blood glucose levels.
- **Counter-Regulatory Hormone Response**: Besides glucagon, other hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline (epinephrine) may be released in response to the initial insulin spike and a decrease in blood glucose levels.
These hormones help to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) by stimulating further glucose production and release into the bloodstream.
The dynamics between insulin and glucagon are crucial here.
While insulin initially acts to decrease blood glucose by promoting glucose uptake into cells, glucagon counters this effect by promoting glucose production.
If the balance shifts more towards glucagon activity (or if the insulin effect diminishes faster than expected), you can see a secondary rise in glucose levels.
Moreover, individual physiological responses can vary based on factors like overall metabolic health, the exact composition of the diet, previous meals, and individual hormonal sensitivity and regulatory mechanisms.
This explanation underscores the complex interplay between different hormones and metabolic pathways in response to food intake, particularly proteins, and highlights why glucose levels might not follow a straightforward pattern.

Summary: 
Insulin also has the effect of lowering blood glucose levels.
The dynamics between insulin and glucagon are crucial here.
