Original Response: 
In the revised code, the following functions remain unchanged:

1.
`ChessGame()`: The default constructor initializes a new chess game with the default settings, including setting the turn to `WHITE`, initializing the game board, and setting `gameComplete` to `false`.
2.
Getters and Setters: The getter and setter methods for `turn`, `gameBoard`, and `gameComplete` remain unchanged.
These methods allow access to the current state of the game.
3.
`endGame()`: This method sets the `gameComplete` flag to `true`, indicating that the game has ended.
4.
`isGameComplete()`: This method returns the value of the `gameComplete` flag, indicating whether the game is complete or not.
5.
`getTeamTurn()`: This method returns the current turn color (`WHITE` or `BLACK`).
6.
`setTeamTurn(TeamColor team)`: This method sets the current turn color to the specified team color.
7.
`setBoard(ChessBoard board)`: This method sets the current chessboard to the specified board.
8.
`getBoard()`: This method returns the current chessboard.
9.
`TeamColor enum`: This enum defines the two possible team colors in a chess game, `WHITE` and `BLACK`.
These functions are essential for managing the state of the chess game and providing access to relevant information such as the current turn, game board, and game completion status.
They remain unchanged to maintain the basic functionality and structure of the `ChessGame` class.

Summary: 
`getBoard()`: This method returns the current chessboard.
These methods allow access to the current state of the game.
`getTeamTurn()`: This method returns the current turn color (`WHITE` or `BLACK`).
