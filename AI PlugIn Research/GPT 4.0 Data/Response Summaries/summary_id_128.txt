If the file is in the "Shared with me" section of Google Drive, you won't be able to access it directly by its path because the "Shared with me" folder is not part of your own Google Drive's file system.
To access such files, you need to add them to your "My Drive" or use their file IDs.
Here’s how you can access a shared file using its file ID:

1.
**Obtain the File ID**: Get the file ID from the shared link.
The file ID is the part of the URL that comes after `/d/` and before `/view`.
