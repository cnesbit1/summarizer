Original Response: 
Your `connectionWebSocket` class is a WebSocket client implementation in Java.
It establishes a WebSocket connection to a server using the specified host and port, sends and receives messages, and handles connection events such as opening and closing the connection.
Here's a breakdown of the code:



Here's a breakdown of the key parts:

- The class is annotated with `@ClientEndpoint`, indicating that it's a WebSocket client.
- It has fields to store the session, base URL, and authentication token.
- The constructor initializes the WebSocket connection by creating a WebSocket container and connecting to the server using the specified host and port.
- An `@OnOpen` method is invoked when the connection is established, and it sets the session.
- An `@OnClose` method is invoked when the connection is closed, and it prints a message indicating the reason for closure.
- An `@OnMessage` method is invoked when a message is received from the server, and it prints the received message.
- The `sendMessage` method sends a message to the server if the session is open.
- The `close` method closes the WebSocket connection.
This class provides a complete WebSocket client implementation that can be used to communicate with a WebSocket server.

Summary: 
- The `close` method closes the WebSocket connection.
