Certainly!
When depicting transitions in a diagram for a two-stack pushdown automaton (PDA), the states are typically represented in the diagram, and the transitions are labeled with input symbols and stack operations.
Here's how you might represent a transition in a diagram for a two-stack PDA:



In this diagram:

- \( q \) and \( p \) represent the current and next states, respectively.
- \( a \) is the input symbol being read.
- \( X \) and \( Y \) represent the symbols popped from the two stacks.
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) represent the symbols pushed onto the two stacks.
The transition is labeled with the input symbol \( a \) and the symbols popped from the stacks (\( X \) and \( Y \)), followed by an arrow pointing to the next state \( p \).
Additionally, the symbols to be pushed onto the stacks (\( \alpha \) and \( \beta \)) are indicated below the arrow.
The diagram provides a visual representation of the transition, showing how the PDA moves from one state to another while reading an input symbol and performing stack operations.
Multiple transitions may originate from or lead to a state, depending on the PDA's behavior and the input symbols.

Summary: 
- \( a \) is the input symbol being read.
