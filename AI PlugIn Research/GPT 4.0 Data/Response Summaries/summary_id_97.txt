Original Response: 
To add WebSocket connections to your Spark server, you can use the `WebSocket` class provided by the Spark library.
Here's how you can modify your `Server` class to include WebSocket functionality:



In this code:

- We've added `registerWebSocketHandlers()` method to register WebSocket handlers.
- We've defined a WebSocket endpoint using `Spark.webSocket("/websocket", MyWebSocketHandler.class)`.
This maps the `/websocket` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
- We've created a nested class `MyWebSocketHandler` that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class defines how to handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
You can customize the behavior inside the `MyWebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket events according to your application requirements.

Summary: 
This maps the `/websocket` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
