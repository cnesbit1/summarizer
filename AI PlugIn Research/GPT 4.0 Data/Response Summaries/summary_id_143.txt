Original Response: 
Yes, iodine solutions typically contain water, especially when referring to solutions used in a laboratory or medical context.
Iodine itself is only slightly soluble in water, so these solutions usually involve iodine dissolved in a mixture of water and an additional solvent that facilitates better dissolution.
The most common type of iodine solution is "iodine tincture," which is a solution of iodine in a mixture of ethanol (alcohol) and water.
Another common preparation is Lugol's solution, which contains iodine and potassium iodide dissolved in water.
The potassium iodide acts as a solubilizer, allowing more iodine to dissolve in the water than would otherwise be possible on its own.
Therefore, in both medical and laboratory contexts, iodine solutions often do contain water as an essential component of the solvent system.
