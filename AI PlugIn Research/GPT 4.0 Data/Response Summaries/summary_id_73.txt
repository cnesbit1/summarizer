Original Response: 
In your `Server` class, you have annotated the class with `@WebSocket`, which indicates that this class is intended to handle WebSocket connections.
However, you have not implemented any WebSocket-specific methods within this class.
Instead, you seem to have defined WebSocket endpoint handling in a separate class, possibly named `webSocketHandler`.
To fix this issue, you need to implement the WebSocket methods (`onWebSocketConnect`, `onWebSocketText`, `onWebSocketBinary`, etc.)
within your `Server` class.
These methods are invoked when certain WebSocket events occur, such as a new connection being established, receiving text or binary messages, or when a connection is closed.
Here's an example of how you can implement these methods within your `Server` class:



Make sure to replace the method bodies with your actual logic for handling WebSocket events such as connecting, closing, and receiving messages.
Also, ensure that you remove the WebSocket endpoint registration from the `registerEndpoints` method and handle WebSocket connections directly within the `Server` class.

Summary: 
However, you have not implemented any WebSocket-specific methods within this class.
