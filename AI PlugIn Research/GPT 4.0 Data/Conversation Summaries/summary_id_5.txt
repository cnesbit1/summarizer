Original Response: 
In Java, both `extends` and `implements` are used in class declarations to establish relationships between classes, but they serve different purposes:

1.
**`extends`**: 
   - `extends` is used to create a subclass (child class) that inherits properties and behaviors from another class, known as the superclass (parent class).
- It enables the subclass to inherit fields and methods from the superclass, allowing for code reuse and promoting a hierarchical relationship between classes.
- A subclass can only `extends` one superclass, as Java does not support multiple inheritance for classes (i.e., a class cannot directly inherit from multiple classes).
Example:


2.
**`implements`**: 
   - `implements` is used to indicate that a class implements an interface.
- An interface in Java is like a contract that defines a set of methods that a class implementing that interface must implement.
- A class can `implements` multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of method signatures only (not implementation).
Example:


In summary, `extends` establishes an inheritance relationship between classes, whereas `implements` indicates that a class adheres to a contract defined by an interface.
Sure, I'll provide an example of how you can initialize instances of the classes defined in the previous examples:



In this example:

- We create instances of the `Dog`, `Car`, and `Bicycle` classes using the `new` keyword followed by the class constructor.
- We then call methods (`sound()` for `Dog`, and `move()` for `Car` and `Bicycle`) on these instances to execute their respective behaviors.
This demonstrates how to initialize and use instances of classes in Java.
Sure, I'll add constructors to the classes in the previous examples:

1.
Adding a constructor to the `Dog` class:



2.
Adding a constructor to the `Car` class:



3.
Adding a constructor to the `Bicycle` class:



Now, when you create instances of these classes, the respective constructors will be invoked, printing the messages indicating that the objects are created:



This example demonstrates how constructors can be used to initialize objects of classes in Java.
Sure, I'll demonstrate how to use the `super` keyword to call the constructor of the superclass in the subclasses:

1.
Modifying the `Dog` class to call the constructor of the `Animal` superclass using `super()`:



2.
Since the `Car` and `Bicycle` classes don't extend any class, there's no need to explicitly call `super()`.
But just to show how `super()` would look:



Now, when you create instances of these classes, the constructors of the superclass (if applicable) will be invoked first before the constructors of the subclasses:



This example demonstrates how to use `super()` to call the constructor of the superclass from the subclass constructors in Java.
To add WebSocket connections to your Spark server, you can use the `WebSocket` class provided by the Spark library.
Here's how you can modify your `Server` class to include WebSocket functionality:



In this code:

- We've added `registerWebSocketHandlers()` method to register WebSocket handlers.
- We've defined a WebSocket endpoint using `Spark.webSocket("/websocket", MyWebSocketHandler.class)`.
This maps the `/websocket` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
- We've created a nested class `MyWebSocketHandler` that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class defines how to handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
You can customize the behavior inside the `MyWebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket events according to your application requirements.
To integrate WebSocket connections into your Spark server, you can follow these steps:

1.
Define a WebSocket handler class that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class will handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
2.
Register a WebSocket endpoint in your `Server` class to map WebSocket connections to the WebSocket handler.
3.
Implement the logic inside the WebSocket handler to handle incoming messages and manage WebSocket sessions.
Here's how you can modify your `Server` class to include WebSocket functionality:



In this code:

- We've added `registerWebSocketHandlers()` method to register WebSocket handlers.
- We've defined a WebSocket endpoint using `Spark.webSocket("/connect", MyWebSocketHandler.class)`.
This maps the `/connect` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
- We've created a nested class `MyWebSocketHandler` that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This class defines how to handle WebSocket events such as receiving messages and closing connections.
You can customize the behavior inside the `MyWebSocketHandler` class to handle WebSocket events according to your application requirements.

Summary: 
Adding a constructor to the `Dog` class:



2.
Adding a constructor to the `Car` class:



3.
This maps the `/websocket` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
Define a WebSocket handler class that implements the `WebSocketHandler` interface.
This maps the `/connect` URL to the `MyWebSocketHandler` class.
This demonstrates how to initialize and use instances of classes in Java.
