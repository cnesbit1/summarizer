            "Reviews:   The convenience of simply tossing one into the laundry without measuring detergent is a game-changer. Not only do they clean my clothes thoroughly, but the Spring Meadow scent leaves them smelling fresh for days. With so many pods in one pack, it's a great value for the price. I highly recommend these Tide PODS for anyone looking for a hassle-free laundry solution! Tide PODS in Spring Meadow scent have truly transformed my laundry routine. The convenience of just tossing one pod into the washer without any measuring has been a game-changer for me. Not only do they clean my clothes thoroughly, but the fresh Spring Meadow scent lasts for days, leaving my laundry smelling wonderfully fresh. Tide Power Pods deliver powerful cleaning with every load, ensuring my clothes come out spotless and smelling great. The pre-measured pods eliminate the mess and guesswork of traditional detergent, making laundry day much simpler and more enjoyable. These are worth it. They are easy and no fuss. One pod does clean up to a large load , and doesn’t affect colors but is a neutral scent. If you like a scent, I recommend buying fabric softener or the fabric softener beads, using these pods it will not over power the added scent. This pod will remove stains in white but if want extra “white”, this pod works well with additions , I.e. “hydrogen peroxide “, etc. Eco friendly, great smell, cleaned my clothes Tide Power Pods have revolutionized my laundry routine. They are incredibly convenient and deliver powerful cleaning with every load. Clothes come out smelling fresh and looking spotless. The pre-measured pods mean no more mess or guesswork. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an effective laundry solution. I always buy this one I use this detergent for all my laundry needs and it does a great job of cleaning everything. Soft on skin. Cleans clothes great. The weight of bottle is very easy to carry. The smell is excellent on your clothes. These Tide detergent pods are so darn convenient! When I started using these, I knew I could depend on the reputation Tide has for getting the dirtiest clothes super clean. I didn’t expect I’d love it more than the liquid detergent,  but I really do! Convenience is the name of the game, and I just love reaching in and throwing a pod in the washer and voila! The only time I use two pods is when I have a full load of towels or a full load of sheets. I’ve been using these for over ten years and don’t plan to stop. I love the price and convenience of delivery. I love it so much that I bought it as a subscription. As long as the price doesn’t fluctuate much, I will continue my subscription. I am totally satisfied! I am happy that Tide Pods in the smell I prefer is available through Amazon. The Clean Breeze scent has not been in the stores that I shop at the price I like in quite some time. I have used many laundry detergents by far this is my favorite. Clothes smell fresh for weeks! I also love the child-proof lock... make sure those kiddos don't get the wrong idea. Tide pods make it so easy to do my laundry. I love this value container because it lasts me for months. The detergent itself is effective for getting out tough stains without damaging my clothing. They easily dissolve leaving just the liquid, and I don’t have any issues with leakage. Can’t really go wrong with a tide pod, i<br>suggest looking at local sales and buying a ton if you plan to stock up. I have a subscription, OK but not the best pricing., but convenience is worth it To wash my clothes with! ! This is my go to scent for my laundry, I love it! Keeps clothes clean and fresh. Use 2 each laundry tub. Works great. Me encantan estas bonitas de detergente,  a primera vista quizás te parezcan caras..pero valen cada centavo..yo las prefiero y las super recomiendo..calidad reconocida .todo en una bola de detergente para lavar Tide cleans all clothing well. Clothing has a clean fresh smell fresh out of the washer. I Like the pods, they are premeasured, so no waste, they dissolve quickly leaving no detergent spots on clothing, and no detergent buildup in washing machine as powder does. My husband does the laundry. It’s easier for him to use than the liquid. We like how it cleans. Been using this for years. Subscribe and save is the best. Throw a pod in the machine and turn it on—no measuring, no drips or mess—easy! It’s easier &amp; cleaner when using the pods. Also no spills or waste, Llego a tiempo y en buen estado Easy to use If one uses this detergent for laundry the best deal is to buy the size for 102 and it lasts longer between refills. I've not been able to find this size in any store. Spend the extra few dollars and get the largest size possible. The amount of time it saves to pour and measure is worth it. It also eliminates the mess with powder or liquid. Laundry Detergent Pods have earned their rightful place as a staple in my laundry routine. With their unbeatable convenience, superior cleaning power, and eco-friendly options, they've simplified the chore of laundry while delivering exceptional results. Whether you're a busy parent, a frequent traveler, or simply seeking a hassle-free laundry solution, these pods are sure to impress. 2 things I don't shrimp on are Tide and TP. Being able to buy a 112 CT for like $25 or so is a great deal that will last me awhile. The wife loves these. It has to be this scent. You'd probably be better asking her about the full quality.<br><br>But from MY POV, I generally lump all my clothes together in the washer and throw one of these in. They come out clean, smelling good and don't look like they fade or transfer color even if I didn't separate them.<br><br>I wash in cold, and they work good there too. Seems like a fair amount for a fair price. Going to buy more I love using pods because it’s all in one &amp; so easy to use. I don’t have to carry a bunch of different bottles to the laundry room. Tide has so many different types to choose from even pods for sensitive skin with no fragrance. I have been using them for years &amp; will continue to do so. I just add maybe some scent beads if I’m washing blankets/linens for that extra boost of freshness. Tide always gets the job done &amp; the ones with Oxi-Clean are great for tough stains. Scent is nice and works great in cold water. Priced better than the supermarket and Fast delivery! Thank you I LOVE THE 3 IN 1 PODS. MAKES LAUNDRY SMELL SO GOOD PLUS KEEPS THE MOLD AWAY FROM WASHER Like for washing Laundry comes clean. I have used Tide for years and will never change. I recommend Tide Detergent for anyone looking for a high-quality laundry detergent that effectively removes tough stains and odors. With its wide range of formulas and scents, there's something for everyone. I started using these about a year ago and love them! I don’t have to worry about people using too much detergent or spilling it. Excelente producto Works great. Smells great These 112 pods pack is a good value and last a long time. Sometimes I just put in one or two pods for a large load and the clothes still come out of the washer clean. I know my son only uses one pod for his huge loads and somehow his clothes come out clean. I use 2-3 pods for towels and sheets. I think I’m getting more value for my money to use pods instead of liquid soap and the pods don’t weigh as much to carry. I’m very happy with this 112 pod pack. Very good product! Noticeable difference in my wash. Good choice I recently tried the Tide Pod Scented Spring Meadow and I have to say, I was really impressed with the fresh and clean scent it left on my clothes. The convenience of the pods also made laundry a lot easier and less messy.<br><br>However, I was really disappointed to find out that they don't sell the Spring Meadow scent in stores. I had to purchase a smaller quantity of pods in store, and I ended up paying a lot more for them compared to buying a larger quantity online. It's unfortunate that such a great product isn't readily available in stores, and that consumers have to pay a premium for a smaller quantity.<br><br>Overall, I think Tide should consider making the Spring Meadow scent more widely available in stores, at a reasonable price. It's a quality product that I would definitely buy again if it was more accessible and affordable. Excellent Tide pods. Good for lots of laundry. I purchased this during Amazon promotion and it’s definitely a good deal. There’s nothing bad I can say about tide and I’m sure you can agree 🤷🏼‍♀️ pretty easy to review since it’s the bomb dot com ! ! does the job Great stuff. Love the pads I like the tide pod they clean very well and there is just no mess with using them Great product that's very easy to use. Just remember to put them in the washer first. Then your clothes on top of the pods. If you put the pods on top  or in the middle of your clothes. They might not dissolve properly. Also if you have a front loading washer like mine. You toss it all the way to the back. If you don't a half dissolved pod might land the the front area of the washer, during one of the spin cycles. Cleaning my cloth use this product as always. Smell good. And easy to carry. We all know tide is good, but this packaging is a very value for  the money It really cleans and leaves a wonderful smell in the house and laundry. I have very sensitive skin and I used all contents of a large container and showed no reaction. I've been buying these pods for years, they work great. Follow the Directions on the Container and My Wash Smells Great and the Clothes Are nice and Clean! Awesome value for the money and costs of individual pods. I will search and search for deals, best prices for quantity before I buy and this was the best deal. BEST compared to the stores. Great clean scent. Last a long time and cleans your clothes well even stains. Great product Always love tide works great I love the pods. Don’t like the liquid I don’t overuse The pods but the liquid i do. I would like the company to get dryer sheets that smell like tide original not the one now the one that smells like Thai back in the 80s I smell the change These new Tides pods really work to get out stains laundry On time,use for laundry and my paper towels are the best, thank you so much. Works as designed. Vivo en un lugar pequeno por lo que mi lavadora es pequena, he probado varios tipos de detergentes y buscaba uno completo y en capsulas para que mi esposo lo manipulara sin derramarlo, este detergente esta completo, te evita estar manipulando liquidos, deja limpia la ropa y con buen aroma sin necesidad de agregar otros productos, excelente Will buy again, if the same deal Worked as it should<br>Smells clean and fresh Each pod is pre-measured for convenience, ensuring no messy spills or waste. The detergent pods dissolve completely in both hot and cold water, penetrating deep into fabric fibers to tackle tough stains effectively. Users appreciate the convenience and ease of use, making laundry day a breeze. However, some might find the scent too strong or prefer a more subtle fragrance It cleans my clothes without any mess Always get these there worth it These dissolve well and don't cause issues to my sensitive skin. They are true to size and I have not had any bust. They are not sticky nor do they leave a stickiness. I only use one per load or two if it's bigger or dirtier than usual This Tide pods are very good and they smell very nice and is very convineint to use. My wife really likes it becuse of it's smell and how much it has in 1 bottle. I usually buy these at Costco but this pack is a little bit bigger and cheaper than Costco! I do lots of laundry in my house and this lasts months! ! Easy to throw 2-3 pods per load and clothes smell fresh!!! Leaves no mess in my laundry room as well!! ! More for your price. And great product delivery driver left our front gate open. did not appreciate that at all! ! Tide pods is one of my favorites and finding it reasonable here is a plus. This scent is nice and not over powering. You can wear your favorite perfume, lotion etc. and it won't clash. I've used Tide for many years. Skip warehouse stores and buy here High count, doesn’t take up the space like 4 bags. Great I can use wash clothes and clean thanks When Delivered at MY DOOR I LOVE IT<br>Handicap an hard to get to Office to Retrieve my Order Exactly like store. Love the scent  it's a good value product Love it makes my clothes fresh I've been using Tide Pods for about a decade now, after seeing some reviews saying they don't dissolve &amp; leave stains or discolor your laundry I decided to write a review. I've never had any issue w/the pods, shipping is shipping &amp; Amazon has gotten worse w/how they package, DO leave instructions for your postal carrier ( there's a space for instructions when you're ordering) for specific placement of packages so they aren't left in the sun or contact your post office directly and ask if they can put a note on your address. When loading your washing machine ALWAYS put your pods in first so they're at the bottom of your wash basin, NEVER put the pods in last, on top of the laundry, I've never had a pod not dissolve or any stain from the pods. HE pods are for High Efficiency washing machines which means your machine breaks down the soap bubbles faster, it's suppose to work that way &amp; you're still getting fantastic cleaning power just without excessive sudsy bubbles, it's safe to use HE pods in regular machines too. I mainly use cold water when doing laundry &amp; depending on the item  I'll occasionally use warm water, again, I've never had any issues with Tide Pods &amp; you shouldn't either if, and here's the main thing, you put the pods in 1st, BEFORE any laundry. I hope this helps with any hesitancy you may have and yes, I would highly recommend Tide Pods. It’s good This is an ex cr excellent product. Cleans well and , as I use the regular scent, leaves my laundry with a very pleasant rather neutral scent.<br><br>One cautionary note- kept them away from moisture. The little packs are constructed of material that is specifically intended to dissolve. Even exposure to a heavy humidity will make them stick. Keeping the top of the container closed should do it nicely. Just be sure to get it closed. I liked the way it makes the clothes smell and the clothes are very clean. Like the smell. Good for the price Bought for my girlfriend after she took my family and I in after a tragic fire planned to buy again Good quality ... not the cheapest but they do a lot better than the cheaper options I've tried This made my clothes really clean and smells nice. Tide pods are the best product ever. They don’t need to be measured. You can carry a handful to the laundry room and keep the large container in the closet. Very convenient. Nothing cleans clothes better than Tide. Nice live on an island, this is he best subscribe and save\n",

            "Reviews:   These are amazing headphones! Sound quality is great, the case charges the ear buds so you don't need to charge the case as much, it holds a battery for a long while (I charge mine probably once a week and use them daily), the ear buds are magnetic so they glide smoothly into the case, they have touch functions on each ear bud (read manual for how to use), they are comfortable, they automatically connect via Bluetooth when you open the case so easy-to-use for sure and best of all they're cheaper than Beats. My husband has a pair of Beats earbuds and I'd say these work just as well as his but fraction of the price. And I don't need to download some app to use them like I would for Beats. Just easy Bluetooth connectivity!<br>The percentage number is how charged the case is and the bars on the left and right of that are to show how charged each ear bud is.<br>I LOVE them! sound quality is surprisingly good,charges fast and it lasts all day. sits comfortably in the ear,comes with 3 different size silicone parts that go into the ear. Arrived defective with touch button not working,but customer service responded very fast and shipped a replacement. To sum up,great product at a great price and customer service is excellent. I do recommend it First, the pros:<br>Sound quality is great but not very loud. I wouldn't recommend if you're working in a noisy environment. Otherwise, great sound.<br>They're very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears easily which is especially good since I have cauliflower ear.<br>Battery life seems decent and the range is as expected.<br><br>Cons:<br>The touch sensitive buttons don't work at all. I mean literally at all. There's no way to pause audio, hang up a phone call or even shut off my pair of headphones without putting them in the charging case or picking up the phone. I don't know who thought it was a good idea to put touch sensors in such a tiny piece of hardware. Just put a real button on it. Please.<br><br>I would only say it was a good value because there was a coupon available that saved me $10 but if not for that I would be very disappointed in the value.<br><br>All that said, they still work alright and I really need earbuds right now so I can deal with no buttons for now.<br><br>UPDATE: The manufacturer reached out and sent me a new replacement pair to make up for malfunctioning buttons on my first pair. Honestly, they work great and for a touch sensor button I find that I don't accidentally press it like I have done in the past with different ear buds. All in all these are great value, the sound quality is nice and the seller takes care of their customers. UPDATE 6/27/24:  So as update, the seller did reach out to me and has been extremely apologetic over the quality control. They have sent out a full replacement and I should be receiving that in the next few days. I do not need to return the defective set. I am extremely impressed with this level of customer service! For that I have changed my review to 4 stars. Looking forward to replacement pair. After that, I’ll give it another month or two and hopefully update to five stars.<br><br>Original 6/24/24:  These ear buds were perfect for what I needed, good sound quality, easy to connect.<br><br>It was a little annoying to have to disconnect from one device in order to connect to a new device (laptop vs phone). But once I got used to doing that, it wasn’t too bad.<br><br>For my level of use, they held the first charge for over a month. I only was using them about an hour each day, and some days not even that. So when I did finally need to charge them, it was past the 30 days for Amazon return.<br><br>And of course there was a problem.<br><br>After I fully charged them, the right ear bud no longer works. After I removed from charging, when the display showed 100% for both earbuds, I connected but the right earbud didn’t work. I put it back into the case and the case then didn’t even register the right ear bud. I get the charge percentage for the left at 100%, but nothing shows for the right.<br><br>I tried cleaning the connections, resetting the case, nothing works.<br><br>I also tried reaching out to the company and never received a response.<br><br>They weren’t terribly expensive and they worked for what I needed them for (I was traveling and had forgotten my usual earbuds so needed a cheap, quick stand-in). But it would have been nice if they had lasted longer than a month, or died before the return window. Now they’re just junk! These are light weight and stay firmly in place. Pairing was a snap and they last a long time. The sound quality is excellent for music. I haven't used them yet for phone calls.. I'm sure these will suffice for that..but my main purpose was for running and bike riding which they outperformed my expectations! I purchased these earbuds a month ago and returned them. The Bluetooth connection was absolutely horrible. Their customer service team reached to me stating that they’ve corrected for the Bluetooth issue I was experiencing and would like to replace my original pair with a new set.<br><br>Well, they actually did it. I’ve been listening for over an hour and I’ve yet to experience a single disconnector dropout. These are Amazing!! These ear buds are really rich in sound and very comfortable. The deep base is important to me and these really deliver.<br><br>Thank you to the representative that reached out to me, he actually cared and I’m grateful.<br>I highly recommend these ear buds. If anything was to goes wrong, customer service is there to assist you. They're not entirely bad, in the sense that they do what you're supposed to (transmit audio), and the battery's not bad at all (haven't died on me once, and I listen for hours).<br><br>Sadly, the noise cancellation is virtually non-existent; you can turn them up all the way, and still hear (which is a good thing), but the problem is—you can still hear backgrounds louder than the buds. I dealt with two inconsiderate commuters on public transportation. A gentleman playing his music loudly from phone speaker, and a man who's was speaking loudly on a phone call; they took dominance over my spotify mix. Also, I tried to watch Dragon Ball Super at Chipotle, and the restaurant's music and activity, made it hard to hear my show.<br><br>The sound is alright, but not very impressive. Amazon lead me to believe that I got them for a heck of a discount.<br><br>Lastly, two more things: (1) they're not very comfortable but for so long, and (2) the touch pads are very difficult to get to work as they should (they almost need to be a little MORE sensitive)<br><br>Sadly, can't say I'm too happy with this purchase, but I need to keep it real. Sound Quality 4.5/5<br>Fit and Feel 4/5<br>Build Quality 3.5/5 (nothing terrible just not great signs for longevity)<br>Sometimes the left earbud wont charge and it is only a few months old. The quality seems ok but it is not as nice as the name brands. The battery life is decent when it charges the left one, the pack itself has great battery life. Sometimes it is weird about pairing (it will pair one and not the other but a simple on off fixes it) or the volume will flake out a little when first paired, but that is uncommon and is not persistent. I am happy with the purchase after a a couple months and using them at around 30 times, but I am skeptic about longevity and owning them more than a like 1-2 years. For the price it was absolutely worth it to me. You know, maybe it's on me for not taking the \"Deep Bass\" part of the item title as seriously as I should've. These are DEFINITELY v-shaped earbuds, and I was surprised when I played a jazz song and had the string bass, which I normally barely hear as it blends in, become the lead instrument. If you don't want potentially overwhelming bass then you'd have to pass on these, but I don't mind too much and it's really nice for some songs.<br><br>The battery life is really good. I have no clue about the earbuds without charging because I don't want to have them die on me while at the gym, but since getting them about five weeks ago I've used them for 1-2 hours a day three days a week and just today the case is down to 10% left so I'm recharging it.<br><br>I have some odd connection issues occasionally, but I honestly think that the hiccups are my phone just having bad blutooth since I've encountered it with other devices as well. The actual issue is that there's seemingly no way to turn these on or anything without the case. I once didn't check if they were on by starting music until I got into the gym only to learn that the left earbud wasn't on and couldn't be turned on, so I had to make a walk of shame back to my car to put them in the case, close it for a few seconds to make the connected earbud disconnect, reopen it, and then take them out again to have them both be connected, powered on, and synced.<br><br>Overall, they're comfortable enough (my left ear has a bit of a fuss with them but it's rarely actually a bother or anything) and the sound is nice. If you want good touch controls, however, then I'd hard pass on these and go for a fancier pair or something. I don't know why, but I can't figure out how to consistently get the touch controls to work. They make a beep when you tap them to register that it took the tap, but I just can't get them to consistently work so I have to pull my phone out to change volume, pause, or skip tracks. I thought these would work out fine for mowing the yard. Not so much. First, before I do anything, I always charge up things. Both the right and left were showing 98% charged but I went ahead and charged them anyway. I then paired them with my iPod. That was the easy part.<br><br>So I took them out when I went to mow on Tuesday (28 May). I had my iPod in my pant pocket. Now normally with my Air Pods, I don't have problems with them staying connected. Not so with these. The music would cut in and out and sometimes, one ear bud would have music and the other wouldn't. BTW...these are not noise cancelling at all and I knew that when I bought them.<br><br>About 1 hour into my mow/weed whacking, the right ear bud stopped working. I ended up going and getting the Air Pods (the reason I bought these was so I wouldn't have to use my expensive ear buds).<br><br>When I went back inside and put them in the charger, the right ear bud showed it basically was dead. The left one had some charge left in it though.<br><br>So. Lessons learned:  wear the iPod on the arm with arm band so the ear buds stay connected. Be prepared to get Air Pods as these don't seem to hold a charge. Don't believe the percentage on the holder/charger. You get what you pay for.<br><br>Update:  I was pleasantly surprised. The company contacted me about the issues and even went so far as to refund my money. Then, they offered to send me an upgraded version of these for no charge (I declined). I must say that the customer service is exceptional. Hence the upgrade to 4 stars. I really like these earbuds for their ease of use and long range. I can set up my tablet to Amazon Music (or just about any website that offers music) and wander all over my yard without losing my tunes. It's also great to be able to just take them out of their case and have them paired and ready to go.<br><br>My only real complaint is the tinniness of the sound, which I understand is due to the fact that I just can't get them properly seated in my ears. I suspect it's because I have very small ears so I can't get them to stay in that sweet spot. If anybody has any ideas about how to fix this, I'm open to suggestions!<br><br>Still think they're great, in fact I bought a second pair; at the price it can't hurt to have a backup. Especially since I have a tendency to lose small electronics, lol.<br><br>I definitely recommend them for everyday listening, though. Just wish I could get them far enough into my ears to get rid of the tinniness. I am not a fan of these at all! The biggest problem is the max volume is way too low! I also hate how you control it. I’m constantly hitting the spot that acts as a button just trying to adjust them. I also feel they are really uncomfortable compared to other Bluetooth earbuds I’ve had in the past! I also hate (and to be fair it’s most electronic things now) the charger that comes with it is just a few inches long! Doesn’t come with the part that actually plugs in.<br><br>There’s two things that I really do like though! The battery life is solid! And I love the light up screen on the case! It tells you the battery life of the charge case as well as each ear bud! That is a nice touch for sure!<br><br>Over all I would never buy it again though!<br><br>I do want to make an edit here: They read the review and they seem to take them seriously! They gave me a full refund and said they would work on the needed improvements! The five stars is for the awesome customer service and hopeful for a new five star product in the near future! Update: 07/09/2024 to 5 star.<br>Excellent customer service. They very promptly sent me a replacement pair and while I haven't had a chance to use them that much, they appear to work much better and I have not had any of the previous issues so far. Great Value.<br><br>Update: 06/29/2024 to 2 star.<br> Seller contacted me within 24 hours of my one star review to replace/refund product. I stated that I had already returned the ear buds. They offered a replacement anyway. I'll update when I receive and test the replacement. Great customer service.<br><br>Original:<br>The battery levels of both ear pieces as well as the level of the case battery is a great feature. Unfortunately on the pair I received the volume randomly increased to max and the Bluetooth connectivity was sporadic. I will have to return. The sound quality and battery life are good. The fit is comfortable. The charging case is pleasant to see and to hold. They charge quickly.<br><br>All sounds good, right? It is. Then you go to use them and while wiggling them into your ear or adjusting one or taking one out briefly to talk to someone or whatever, touching them causes all kinds of random unwanted effects like pausing a music track or muting it or powering off the earbuds.<br><br>Super, super annoying. And it's hard to repeat it with effort, so it's hard to figure out what not to do, if indeed it can even be avoided since they are small and you basically have to touch a lot of the surface of the earbuds to put them in or take them out.<br><br>I'm still using them and it's kinda alight, but they'd be much better without these \"features. \"<br><br>edit: The seller did reach out to me offering to try to resolve my experience somehow, potentially by replacing them. I don't want a replacement, because I don't think my set is defective, I think I just don't like how the touch feature works on this headset. But I was impressed with their customer service, so that's worth mentioning.<br><br>In keeping with that, bumped it from 3 stars to 4. Recently bought these primarily because the description stated 50H. Using them for the first time I got maybe 5hrs or use before the buds started complaining of a low battery. Note this is after leaving the case plugged in and the pods in the case overnight AND the case showed 100% charge on the buds and case.<br><br>The plan was to use these to replace my over the ear headphones for work, but disappointed on the battery life. I gave it 4 stars because for the average use of most people it will be fine, but did discount the battery life to 2 stars simply because it didn't meet what was described/advertised. I don’t know how they can fix this problem, but the case is so small. It’s so easy to lose. I’ve lost it two or three times and gone around looking sometimes it falls out of my fanny pack or pocket and they’re black so they blend in with the carpet of your car and your clothes, if they were bright fluorescent orange, it would be different. That’s the only negative as far as functionality goes very good. I liked the charging case how it showed the charge. I only used the earbuds for about 3 minutes. The buttons on the devise were really hard to push. Most of the time they were unresponsive or they would get stucked in the pushed in mode. Like if you were lowering the volume it would lower all the way to the lowest setting. Turn the volume up with the phone and soon as you let off the phone volume the ear buds would lower to the lowest volume.<br><br>Added Comment:<br>The company reached out to me and are sending me a new pair out. The costomer servive is/was outstanding. Thanks so much for making it right. I didn't pay much so wasn't expecting much. And that proved to be true. If I'm using them while my device is right in front of me or on my arm while exercising they work great. But if I have device in a fanny pack or cup holder while doing outside activities the headphones will cut in and out sometimes. Kind of like a clingy pet - needs to be right next to device or won't work right. First off I have always been leary off buying earbuds due to having extremely small ear canals. After reading all the reviews, and watching the video I decided to give these puppies a try. OMG!! !<br><br>I received them three days ago, and at first I thought I was going to have to return them as the left one wouldn't work. After reading the trouble shooting I wiped the ends of both buds with a Q-tip, along with the inside of the docking station, and allowed them to charge for a couple hours Re-paired them to my phone and BINGO!<br><br>I am OLD (68) this July, and I LOVE most music, except headbanger, and rap. But my all time fav is true rock. I'm talking the Doors, The Who, CCR, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin...you get the idea, most of the time I only use the right bud so I can still talk with my sister, or on my landline (yes I still have one of those). Even with just one bud in the sound is phenomenal!<br><br>Last night I went to sleep with the right bud in and it stayed in all night.<br><br>My only complaint is that for my old arthritic fingers I do sometimes have an issue with them turning off when I'm trying to insert them, but hey no one ever promised me a rose garden!<br><br>These buds have  got to be the best on the market, and FYI I'm NOT getting compensated for this review. You can't go wrong, especially at this price! Lots of hours but hard on the ears . If you use them for long periods. Also if you touch them they change what you were listening to. So the one touch button needs work.<br>All that said this company listen and read the review. And refunded my money and I didn't ask for it. I was just going to donate them to Goodwill as somebody might be able to wear them their just not right for me. Because they gave me a refund that I didn't ask for I think they deserve a 5 star for effort. My son gives them 5 stars<br>Good QUALITY<br>Deep Bass<br>Stability<br>Comfort FIT<br>Work out with them beautifully<br>Noise Cancelling perfect<br>Mic QUALITY excellent<br>Black color and charging case REALLY COOL!<br>THE EARPHONES CHARGE IN CASE WITHOUT BEING PLUGGED IN THE WALL-AFTER THE 1ST TIME OF CHARGING THE CASE IN AN OUTLET ON THE WALL-REALLY COOL!<br><br>CONS...<br>THEY DID NOT WORK FOR ME... MY EARS ARE SMALL... COMPLETE OPPOSITE FOR ME!! !<br><br>MY SON LOVES THEM! WE ARE SUPER GRATEFUL FOR SUCH A WONDERFUL PRODUCT! GOD BLESS THIS COMPANY AND EVERYONE THAT READS THIS! I LOVE U 2! XOX AMBER I previously wrote a negative review about this product as mine happened to be defective in several aspects. However I give credit when and where it is due. The customer support system has been very welcoming and resolved my purchase, and made several very generous apologies. Should you unfortunately recieve a product that isn't working quite right, rest assured the team here will offer whatever support and compensation they can. They are thorough and very generous, and I sincerely hope my previous review about the product was just a one time issue, and that potential buyers enjoy the teams products My first pair of ear buds; Wireless Earbuds Bluetooth V5.3 I bought them as a low cost entry into keeping my music quiet from other travelers on the planes &amp; trains. They work automatically once out of the case and paired with your phone/tablet etc. I haven't bought nor tried the expensive big name ear buds so I can't provide a comparison to those. If you need them, get them; A great entry level price for all ages. Good fit, great value. These are the buds your mom would like you to buy. They do not get loud. Lynyrd Skynyrd told me to turn it up….and I couldn’t . They work well, but the volume up and down feature can be a bit finicky. The touch/tap response isn’t always perfect the spot that needs contact isn’t the most accessible when bud is in most comfortable position in my ear. I seem to prefer small ear buds, to large hurts. These are useable but if that’s something you’re seeking I still wish they were a mm or 2 smaller I’ve had a hard time finding decent in ear Bluetooth headphones until I tried these. The bass is great and the charger being built into the case is a great option. They last a long time before needing recharging so that’s another good thing about these headphones. I would recommend these for anyone looking for inexpensive headphones that sound good and won’t hurt your wallet. If u are looking for a great pair of ear buds these are definitely worth the money 💰 I have a a Samsung galaxy S20 5G. I know a lot of people with Apple phone or iPhone if u go to the music store go to your settings &amp; adjust the bass, trouble, &amp; mids it will sound better for u all even when u Bluetooth to your car stereo system. Samsung galaxy has a EQ you can adjust for the quality sound as well. I updated my review after not only dealing with possibly the best customer service I've ever dealt with, for any product..The new ones they sent as of now work really well, they properly charge. I still wish the volume was higher but its a minor thing for a cheap set of earbuds..The company has been in contact with me the whole way, I didn't have to return the bad ones. I really can't complain. The product wasn't great but they went above and beyond to make it right. I've never dealt with a seller so cool and if all I have to say is the volume doesn't blow my eardrums out like I want lol then I call that a win 🤷‍♀️ I left my original review up just so everyone can see that I wasn't happy at first, but they did right by me despite a not so nice review..<br><br>Despite my negative experience with the actual earbuds. I will say after posting my review the seller contacted me, and asked how they could make it right. They offered a new pair or a full refund..I took the refund and they said it was processed in about 40 minutes. So I can't complain on that front. Crap happens, but I do appreciate when a company is willing to say Hey we messed up, lets make it right..<br><br>I bought these to replace my earbuds I had over a year. I purchased them March 16....It's March 27 and the left side won't turning , won't connect, nothing. It's dead AF..As soon as I got them the case was defective. It wouldn't charge right..I had to tap it to get it to register and charge the ear buds<br>..I loved the heavy bass on these but they are garbage and I'm so pissed. I NEED my earbuds, this isn't a casual nothing better to do situation. I use them for work and these people screwed me with their crap product.... It has amazing base/ bass, but the volume seems to jump from zero to 3.. not a gradual climb when unmuting..<br>Comfortable and fits well<br>Right ear bud doesn't seem to charge(connect to port) but base on other reviews,  this is probably a rare instance. It's within 30 days so I'll get a exchange and hopefully I will not have this problem again. Tbc<br>Added bonus, the company says we can register our product for worry free warranty. Wish me luck lol. Will update upon getting new pair The color is great, hold a charge well. Good sound quality. My ears are small so I always have trouble finding ear buds that fit but these do the trick and the cost is easy on the wallet 😀 Worked for about a week. Completely stopped connecting automatically, had to put the headphones in and out of the case to start connection and then eventually stopped connecting completely. The headphones also stopped charging inside the case as well within a month. Unable to return once they stopped working according to Amazon- the company reached out to me and asked if they could replace the product themselves! They sent a full replacement and so far, so good. I have yet to experience them for a month just yet but the customer service has been excellent. PRO: The sound is truly amazing and they fit really nice in my ears, no pain from having them in for a few hours.<br><br>CON: most annoyingest part is the control buttons, because they're not facing outward they're facing to the side more inward so it is so hard for me with my big hands to hit pause or turn the volume up or down. if it was on the outside part like all the other ones I'd give it a five star.<br>Yes I would recommend. Just paired these to my new Google Pixel 7 Pro. Took a bit of time for the phone to find the device, but once it located \"Google Nest\" (per instructions), the pairing was flawless. Buds only seem to control volume (no skip to next song) but I can manually do that on my phone. Didn't see instructions for that capability so if someone has a suggestion, feel free to post response. Overall, a good purchase. I’ll wait away they fell in my ears because they’re comfortable and also like the sound Besides the cute pink color, the Bluetooth connected quickly and allowed me to use the earbuds right out the box with very little instruction. I like that they're easily portable, have great battery life, and help me watch videos, listen to music, or make phone calls without having to deal with an annoying wire. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. 😁 I grabbed these ear buds &amp; was surprised how well they worked. Comfort is 7/10, sound 8/10. All this for under $50. At first I was a little hesitant about purchasing these earbuds,  but I'm happy to say I am pleased with my purchase. Charging was quick and once I opened the earbuds they immediately showed up on my phone for quick syncing. easy to connect, but I can't seem to get the music to turn up louder. I ride the tractor while listening to the music but I would like it a bit loader. I used my phone volume but it doesnt seem any louder. Good headphones, they do the job and they sound good, the only thing I find bad is the touch since it is null, they don't work at all, it doesn't raise or lower the volume, let alone talk about the other functions it should have. The headset works if you have your cell phone nearby and you do all the functions directly from the phone My ex bf recommended this earbud...well I decided to purchase this right away because I was tired of the wires to my headphones. I totally agree with him! It was easy to connect to my bluetooth on my Samsung Flip phone. Package came with 3 sets of sizes of ear cushions and medium size was perfect for me. The sound quality for this price was unbelievable and I truly recommend this product. It will surprise you! Battery life is impressive and it was easy to control the volume with my phone's volume buttons. Thank you to the product maker and seller for making this affordable. It’s quite good overall. The sound quality is great! The only problem is that the earbud’s mic isn’t that good. There’s always this background noise that never goes away during phone calls. Also, it can get difficult sometimes to connect to devices. My right channel went out. I did hear from customer service and immediately agreed to send me a refund and a new pair  Thank you for listening to me and gaining my confidence Mobility battery life is great mic quality is good color is fine music clarity is pure bliss range depending if leave ur phone dock and have interference the it fades in and out comfortable fits ear lobe I had originally bought these for my daughter who asked for wireless ear buds. I was looking for multi-point because she switches between devices, but I must have gotten confused after researching through Amazon.<br><br>So these earbuds do not have multipoint connection ability. They can only actively pair to one device at a time.<br><br>Sound-wise, they're pretty good. Good enough for both spoken and music/gaming. Not the best, but I think they're more than acceptable to most people. Calls are okay as well.<br><br>Fit wise, however, these are kinda weird. The first time I put these in my ears, I wasn't sure if I was putting the correct sides. There are \"L\" and \"R\" markings though, which was helpful. But they kinda sit a little awkwardly in my ears. And the controls are also unusual, and not that intuitive;  you'll need to read the instructions to find where the controls are and how they work.<br><br>So, if you need a good backup pair of wireless earbuds, these are a good choice if you can get them at a deep discount (under $20). If this is going to be a daily driver though, I'd keep looking. The little speaker cover on one of the earbuds fell inside. No way to fix them. The company reached out to me after I posted my review and asked if they could replace the earbuds at no charge, and I didn't need to send back the broken pair. Wonderful customer service. I usually have problems getting earbuds to to stay in my ears and be comfortable. These do the trick. Also sound great! Every bit as good as those costing 10X the price. Great value! I would definitely recommend. Great customer service as well. Ordered a pair of ear buds and they was not very loud at all . Customer service reached out to me very quickly and was polite and concerned . Customer service sent me a new pair and they worked great . Customer service is A+ and will order from again . Thank you for the great customer service ! I bought these earbuds but I received defective ones. The sound quality was still amazing despite them being defective, not only did the company that manufactured these refund me my money, they sent me a brand new pair and gave me 30 bucks. Give these earbuds a try, so at least if you don't like them, you know it's a good company making them In my life I've been through hundreds of headphones, never was a fan of ear buds as they are always uncomfortable... I went out on a limb ordering these ones as I thought they'd be just a cheap pair of ear buds. I was wrong!<br><br>The bass quality is so perfectly balanced, the battery life is so amazing. I never have to worry about charging it. Now, I don't use it all work day long, more so, doing chores, on my way to work, and my commute to work and home.<br><br>If I had to give a negative, it's maybe the connectivity. I will mow the lawn and have my phone in my pocket and maybe twice the audio randomly cut out but it's so brief that it doesn't bother me. It could also be my phones problem. They work very well. I bit uncomfortable if worn for an extended period. I have been very pleasantly surprised regarding the sound quality of these earbuds. I was looking for a less expensive option (since I have a bad habit of loosing my earbuds) and these were recommended to me. For the price the sound quality is very good, there is definite base which many of the lesser priced earbuds are missing. There is very little noise canceling and the battery life is good; used them for the entire day and the battery lasted. It is the recharge time that takes a long time. But if you recharge them while you sleep your golden, the charge will last all day. I recently got my hands on a pair of these amazing earbuds, and I’m thrilled with my purchase. I already have a pair of earphones that I love but I do not use them for work because they cancel out the sound all around me but these work perfectly for work. They sound good when I’m answering the phone, they sounds good when I’m listening to music and most importantly, for the sound that I’m getting the price is great. Another good thing about these earbuds is they come with three different size silicone earbud covers for your ear, which is great, you will easily find the right fit for you. You also can see the charge level immediately, no need to wonder if your earbuds are fully charged. If you’re reading this go ahead and get yourself a pair, you won’t be sorry. Overall a great set of earbuds!I listen to books and music 4+ hours a day and these are perfect! I bought in March and it’s June and the right ear quit working… after my review they contacted me and offered me either a replacement or refund and I’m going to give it another try. I did like the size and sound of these. But I have never experienced such great customer service like this in a long time! Easy to open, setup and charge. Quickly Bluetooth the pack to your phone. It comes with a charger via USB and USB-C. At full volume is my preference, wish it would go even higher but I will continue using it continuously. I'm happy with this product Nicely packaged. Didn't want to pair to my phone at first. I hit the bluetooth scan on my<br>Samsung A35 and got Cloud Nest ( the earbuds) to appear on the Bluetooth list. It connected flawlessly after that. Sounds OK. They are earbuds. Easy charging. Will work. Really solid performer for the price. Very bassy with clear highs as well. I had to trim the bass down via the EQ on my phone and it's balanced everything right up. But really solid unit! I really like how it shows the battery bar for each headphone as well as the whole pack. Works well especially on my long conversations with a friend miles away. She says she can hear me fine. Just wish the smaller ear buds were even a little smaller as I feel like they could fall out easily. I had an issue with the earbuds and was just going to post a review of my experience with them. Shortly after posting it Bettie reached out to make sure I would be happy with their product. I did not ask for anything, they just took it upon themselves to make sure that I as a customer was happy. Excellent customer service. For the price, great sound, and a wonderful fit for my ears. Also, easy set up, and I like the fact that you can read the percentage of the charge! ! Overall these are fantastic,feel good,sound very good, battery is great. My only issue is the button being on the front of the stem feels a little weird to tap and makes me feel like I'm gonna knock it out of my ear some times Just received these and used them for the first time. They are affordable and comfortable and I love the white color.<br><br>Pro- quality<br>Con- none These have much better comfort in the ears compared to another brand I had gotten. So am now testing it for durability and length of charge. Not the biggest fan of button placement on front-facing side of earpiece, as opposed to side-facing portion of ear, but sounds is pretty good for the price. Not much noise canceling/ top volume isnt very loud. Range is very good, battery life is decent. The quality for the price is great. They are comfortable in your ear as well. **** Changing my review because of great customer service. They immediately contacted me and refunded my money and offered to send me a new one if I gave them my address. I haven't done that yet though.<br><br>Connects without a problem, but neither touch button works. Not very useful. Bought these to use on an overseas trip to share audio tour guides with my partner. Good range from the phone and good battery life. No complaints thus far. I got these for my son while he is in Job Corps and he loves them. Said they last almost all day and sound really good. What I like about these earphones is the ability to listen to music in high quality and the ability to walk around without having my phone close to me. What I found a little annoying, was that it was a bit difficult to adjust settings (Mainly Volume) without defined buttons. Other than that, I enjoy this item. One of the gifts for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves them! Loves the noise cancellation and the fact that the sound lowers when he removes them from his ears to speak to someone in person. Stay charged a long time while he works. UPDATE!! C/S is awesome. They are sending another pair for me to try.<br><br>They have amazing sound. 3 stars.....Will not stay in my ears. Have tried all 3 sizes of tips. Can get them to turn off and on sometimes but no volume control. Was really hoping they would work for me! ! Good sound the only problem I have is they don't stand my ears but that's more the shape of my ears I think with the rubber tips I have had other More expensive earbuds, But these were the best. They stayed in my ear easily, the sound quality was great. They were easy to charge, and the storage container also indicated how much charge was left. They are very simple to use, but note there are no buttons on them So every change has to go through the phone. It works for me, but it may not be for everybody. I haven't had them for long but these are awesome. They sound great with lots of clear bass. They hold a battery charge for a long time and fit in the ear well. Probably the best pair I've owned,  especially for the money. Great Sound, fast connection. I'm worried the battery might drain fast because you can not turn them off while they are paired, but otherwise they seem like a good product. And decent price. but will be going back for the teal color ones. Battery life seems decent about two hours play on half charge probably longer on full charge. These are top their. I have purchase 3 pair thus far. The first for my husband that said they were better than his beats by Dre. I have then purchased 2 more pair and he is right top quality at a fraction of the cost The product came as ordered and was able to be used immediately. The buds fit comfortably and securely in the ear and the sound was very clear and precise. I heard parts in the music that I had listened to hundreds of times that I hadn’t heard before. These headphones are inconsistent, glitchy, and fall out more than the out-of-shape dude on a Company PT run...I've had these for 4 months now and I use them sparingly now. They're really just garbage. There is 0 noise cancelling. All my calls can hear everything in the background. The touch sensors don't always work right and are often plain unresponsive. If I sweat they slip out. If I run they slip out. If i jump they slip out. Laugh. Sneeze. You get the idea. I've changed the inner cushions too but no success. Don't buy these. Go with a better brand.<br><br>Update 6/11/24: Customer Service listen to my complaints about how it continued to fall out of my ear and offered to send me a new pair, but as I did not believe the design had changed, I declined. They followed up a few weeks later and asked if I would be interested in a different type of headphones that they also sold so I accepted this offer, hoping it would address the bad fit issue..it was awkward but my kid loved it so I gifted it to him..I've changed my rating from 1 to 3 because while the product is not great. As far as staying inside of the ear, the customer service is pretty outstanding and I didn't see a lot of reviews for folks having the same issues as me. Me so I don't know if I'm the outlier or the bad variable here. I'll give them the benefit of doubt and update my reading to three I do like the deep base sound. I just wish these had higher volume as i use them in garden tractor and bush hog on tractor. I can’t get it to work on my iMac laptop but it’s good for my iPhone. The volume controls, forget it! Can’t figure that out! The extra rubber tips are nice to have and are great in use. I found the smaller rubber tips help keep the earbuds in my ears more securely.<br><br>The seller has great customer service. Very quick to reply and resolve any issues you have have. A great price. I love these earbuds. They do not hurt my ears,  the sound quality is great and the stay charged for a long time. Easy-to-pair with Bluetooth. Sound good. Only thing is I haven't been able to is use the touch features for volume and answer functions. I like the fit and the price, the buttons on each earbud are a bit difficult to work with if you have acrylic nails These are amazing! Great sound and long-lasting, fast charging. Easy to pair to my phone (Andoid). I wasn't looking for anything for more than to use while working out, these are absolutely great for that! Haven't tried taking a phone call with them yet, so I can't speak to that. But overall I'm super happy with these - especially for the price! I love these. I use them when I am working out at the gym or at home. They are perfect for listening to music while doing housework, and outside activities. easy to pair. sound is great. have only had for a few days but they seem to hold a good charge They randomly lose signal (even when standing next to the device they're paired with) and give choppy audio. They also randomly disconnect.<br><br>Edit: I've bumped my two stars to five stars. After my original post, the company did reach out on multiple occasions to offer me a full refund (which I accepted),as well as a second pair of headphones completely free (which I declined as I still use the ones I'd bought originally).An additional gift card was offered as an added apology for any inconvince. I'm really impressed by their commitment to excellent customer service. I filled out the lifetime warranty, not thinking much of it, but managed to lose an ear bud and they sent me a new pair. Really good sound quality. And comfy earbuds. They stay in my ears unlike other brands. Bought these as a spare to use at work while listening to music but they actually turned out to be so good i swapped with my main pair. Great headphones for the pricing point I got these for myself to use at my office. I work on an almost empty floor and wanted an inexpensive pair of ear buds to listen to ebook or documentaries as I worked. I've been using these for a couple of months and they're decent for the price. I do have connectivity issues once in a blue moon, and the ear bud cushion things don't really have a size that is super comfortable for me, personally, but they are goon enough I use every day for almost 8 hours a day. The sound quality is amazing! Strong base, and everything is super clear, its a nice crisp, smooth sound! My spotify has a variety of songs (almost 2,000) i tried songs from various genres from country, pop, rock (classic, modern, soft, hard) EDM, and a couple others. I am genuinely impressed with the sound quality on everything! I bought these because I thought I lost my Lenovo earbuds. I ended up finding them afterwards, but these didn't disappoint at all. The call quality is nice. I wish they had bigger bass for music... my personal preference, but the overall sound quality for music is above average. If you don't like heavy bass... these are perfect. They work great, but for some reason on day 2 one of them stopped working. Not sure if it's something I did? But a good value especially if they both work! Happy with these ear buds. Easy to pair, lots if functions to control with the tap buttons (volume, Play, pause, skip, etc) and I like that the case indicates charge level These earbuds are comfortable, and deliver good quality sound. Have not had a problem with them becoming dislodged from ears during my workouts. I'm pleased with the item. It meets my expectations. I am satisfied with the sound especially when I'm listening to music. I’m totally satisfied with my earbuds AND the customer service I’ve received. Molly is by far the nicest and easiest customer service person I’ve dealt with. I’d never used earbuds before and I was surprised how easy they were to adjust to. Good product.\n",

            "Reviews:   Fairly easy to put together, brakes are a little complicate. All in all a nice riding bike. I did buy a different seat for it. More comfortable. Very nice bike. Perfect size for a man, or a young man. Looks great to. Shipped fast as well. Packaged great. Ty The bike is fairly nice for the price. I haven't ridden a bike in a long time, so I'm not used to it. The seat is not comfortable, but I was told my behind will get used to it after a while. The assembly wasn't bad, but be careful of the front break assembly. Have to loosen it to get the front wheel on. I loosened it too much and it kind of fell apart and was a pain to get back together properly. I noticed this problem in a couple of reviews, after I assembled it. Nice bike The frame was all scratched the brakes were messed up and are missing something the gear shifter is cracked and does not work. In the end I would never buy this bike again. The only issue I had was that the instructions were hard to understand. I ended up braking the front brakes installing the front wheel and had to take the bike to a shop to get it fixed. It is still too big for my grandson and have to wait a little to try it. My son loves it Great product. My only concern is this- they dont provide any tools to assemble the cycle. While I did have the tools in my disposal, many people might not have… just a food for thought. Upon assembly we were adjusting the seat and the neck fell into the seat frame and couldn't get it out it was stuck in there real good so there was no way to fix so my son didn't get to ride it. I think if they made it so the seat tube doesn't fall clear down but makes it to wear you can easily grab it back then it might of been better Rims are a little thing dog took out the front rim first crash put better rims on it and changed the derailleur wire I messed up and it's as to be expected for a 100$ MTN bike it's not gonna go on a expert course but normal riding it's ok once you get at better seat Aside with some front derailleur issues we are still having, the bike is a good one. The frame is very stiff. The tires are the right size for suburban biking. The quality is very good for the price, but I don't think the folks at the factory are bike enthusiasts.<br><br>I had to have a pro tweak the brakes, significantly adjust the derailleurs and fix the front wheel which was warped out of the box. The wheels needed to be \"trued\" which involves adjusting the tension on the spokes.<br><br>Getting everything just right, the brakes, 'truing' the wheels and adjusting the derailleurs  are something you will want a bike pro to handle. The guy spent about 20-30 minutes and charged for $40 labor, well worth it to start my daughter off right on her new bike.<br><br>This was not optional. The front wheel would rub against the brakes during part of its rotation since the wheel was warped, which was easily fixed by the tech by adjusting the spokes.<br><br>Since new bikes at my local cycle shop start at $700, this is still a very good deal. For the wheel size, the seat is very high, even in the lowest position. The seat itself is also very hard &amp; uncomfortable. I Bought this bike for my 8 years-old boy, and is very satisfy with it quality and sturdiness. Seats a little hard but easy to look past, great kids bike! For the price the bike isnt bad. I still need to make some adjustments but it is rideable out of the box. For a leulisurely rider you cant ask for a lot at the price point. It has wheels and brakes, and everything works.<br><br>The seat.....is horrendous. Im a little rusty but we did one 45 minute bike ride and my lady parts still have some numbness...its been a few weeks so im not sure how that much damage happened that quickly. Purchased a replacement and im looking forward to trying it with a lot more comfort. The right pedal on the bike can't be squeezed tight from the screws it was bought with because of a problem with the turnbuckle inside. It doesn't fit at the moment. I seldom ride it,but today it fall off when I ride it, I hope to replace this right side part. Good! I'm 13 yrs old and my dad bought it for me for my birthday. I am really short I'm about 4'9 or 4'10 and the seat can't go any lower so it was a little too tall for me. Also the seat is pretty hard and uncomfortable but all bike seats are. (although this one is more uncomfortable than usual 😬) my dad got it to finally teach me how to ride and he said to go on amazon and pick the one I want. After reading the reviews I picked this one. I wasn't aware this was a mountain bike when I bought it, but my brother pointed it out to me when it came. I knew there was something off abt the handles LMAO. He said it would be harder to learn cuz mountain bikes aren't really for beginners but oh well. Anyways I recommend for children 12-15. But again, bike seat is pretty tall. Don't recommend for anyone shorter than 4'9. I ordered this bike to be donated to a local elementary school for a fundraiser and it showed up with rust on the front fork. I didn’t have time to send it back before the fundraiser date, but was disappointed to deliver it with rust on it. Hard to assemble but he loved it. Good quality for a beginner. Perfect size. Nightmare to assemble, but after it’s in one piece, it’s great.<br>I consider myself pretty handy, and have assembled a fair amount of bikes before this one, yet I struggled with this one quite a bit. First, nearly each screw requires a different sized open-end wrench or allen wrench, so keeping your tools nearby is absolutely necessary here.<br>The instructions are fine, but super frustrating when they tell you to do something you can’t. For example, the pedals comes disassembled and you must attached them. Right one went on easily, left on wasn’t threaded correctly. So after 14,538 swear words and some beating and banging, I had to remove the right pedal, attempt to screw it in to the left pedal’s place to strip the thread, and then... finally could get the left pedal on.<br>So many tiny issues like that, would’ve made assembly worth it if I’d known.<br>Get what you pay for, I guess, but jeez... frust-rat-ing! - 3.5 stars I really think the people writing bad reviews on this bike, or saying its hard to assemble, probably are extremely lacking upstairs or have never turned a wrench in their life. I put this bike together in 30 minutes tops, most of which was taking cardboard off. The bike works fine after a few adjustments, mainly on the brakes. The seat is awful so I ordered a cushion to go over it. I rode it around my neighborhood and took it camping. No issues for a simple casual ride around, of course I would'nt take this out in the mountains or down trails in the woods, its perfect for a nightly cruise around the neighborhood Packaging was nice, easy to assemble and ready for the nice weather! Only complaint is the seat is a bit hard!! Seems to change gears easy enough and no chain slippage from what we can tell. This bike is very nice, I am 5'6\" and it's perfect . I did raise the seat a bit . I ordered a black but i  got a blue one. I must say I like the blue so scored there. The front tire due to shipping is a bit off (not sure if it is there or a slightly bent rim? Once again shipping problem. Only took 15 minutes to put together. Buy a pump, the tires are not fully aired up. Have a pair of vise grips ready for front tire install to grab brake cable. Very hard to rethread cable . Over all very satisfied. I just got back from a pain ride due to seat! But y a padded seat or your a$$ will hate you, so uncomfortable . Everything else BUT THE SEAT is great! It is extremely nice looking Great color! When I received it handlebar was sticking out the package I put it together and needless to say he can’t even ride it Yet Easy to assemble, very sturdy, but still light enough to pick up. In all, it's a great bike! ! the bike is good for the price. But there are no tools in the package. I have to buy them andit takes time. no convenient for some people like me. My grandson got his bike run over by a neighbor in the neighbor would not replace his bike I learned about this and I said this boy deserves to have a bike so I took it on myself as his grandpa to buy him a brand new bicycle the one he had was older and he got good use out of it but the smile on his face when he saw his brand new bicycle is something I as a grandfather will never forget thank you for providing me with a great product in a timely manner The bike is nice, but the front cable for the V-Brake needs to be replaced. I've worked on many bikes, and for some reason the front brake on this bike was defective. I'm not too happy with the front brake. I bought this biker for commuting only, and it works nicely at this price point. The bike is very easy to assemble, even for a bike newbie like me. The only inconvenience I have with this bike is that the frame is made of steel, so it requires more strength to pedal (more than a Walmart bike). Also, you might have to true the wheels. Was kind of a pain to put together but it was the first time I've ever assembled a bike. Seat seems like it's going to be a bit uncomfortable being only 6in. wide. Front rim is slightly bent but should be fine. Biggest complaint is they sent me the purple one when I ordered black, but that's not enough of an issue for me to bother returning it. My 13 year old loves the bike. It was easy to assemble. So disappointed that the bike inner tubes need to be replaced. Didn’t hold air for even one ride. 😞 Tried the troubleshooting and support links, but kept getting errors. Frustrating lack of support. Cute bike and takes a few hours to get brakes and chains properly aligned.<br><br>Horrible horrible seat tho. 1st too hard more of a males seat. Long narrow and hard as a rock, women's should be shorter wider, and softer. Replaced seat and love it.<br><br> However, still doesn't quite work out for me. I'm 5'1\" (61\" on the dot), I'm pretty even when it comes to torso vs leg in making up height. And the seat is still too tall for me. (Note: if you tip toe to touch ground (while on seat) tech you dont fit it (which is what I am on this bike))<br>Lowest seat setting and still doesn't work. And lowest also doesn't stay. (I tighten it and when i sit on it (I'm only 130 so average sized) it drops down and starts turning about.) Not yet sure how I'm going to fix this problem, may need new bike but yeah it's cheap so you get what you get. Read the reviews before buying this product because I couldn't believe the excellent price would offer a decent bike...my husband and I had a lot more trouble putting it together than some of the folks did but we finally got it done. Do not buy this bike for anyone who is not at least 5'3\". It is a very substantial bike for the money but I bought the bike for myself and even with the seat at it's lowest point I can't ride it as I am a mere 5' (and shrinking!) tall. So my husband gets this one and I'll be looking at the kids bikes! Muy buenaaa y vino todo it's heavy, which is expected for sth really cheap. assembly and riding is fairly simple, but quality is something else. it's very loud when ridden and overall build quality is pretty terrible. the inner tire air compartment burst while riding for the first 10 minutes, and this was after properly inflating. overall would not recommend. The bike itself is really nice and sleek but when it was being assembled one of the parts was broken. If not I would of gave this product a full 5 stars. I have to add grease in all the gear and inside the pedal gear because they were not even rolling..... looks like was very old or not storage well.<br>If you are handy for the price is a good deal but you have to consider to work a little. On a budget though this is a step up from Walmart junk bikes. Payed more than Walmart bike. Bought for my daughter's first mountain bike hard tail. To start riding with me on the easy trails. Assablaly was as expected in boxed bike's easy and tune the deralers. Air the tires up. First Ride the crank bearings broke jamed the pedals up. I had to force and brake the broken Crank bearing races to free it up to make it at least ridable back to the parking lot about a mile on to the trail. As the hole crack assembly was wabbling and chain keeps falling off. I fixed it with spar bearings I had that where old stock so the replacement bearings where USA made. Not this junk. Thay did not have enough grease in the bell crank. It was way over tight also. Also when assembly the front shocks would not move or budge. It took a full grown man me to slam down on the front forks shocks to free them up. Por manufacturing junk internal parts cheap Chinese junck!. When this is a amarican bike company you would think the quality standard's would be good. For now on I rather buy a used good quality bike from excellent independent bike shops. Or dick's sporting goods is mutch better. Even there cheaper bikes are good better quality. You pay a bit more but it's worth it. You can bring the bike Right into dicks and thay will fix or replace parts anything on the spot usually free of charge. Nice bike, but not happy about the scratches. I would exchange it, but I'm not hauling it to UPS. Also, the tires could be better quality but I can replace them when the time comes. This bike arrived with a broken bike seat. Wasn’t the easiest to put together The tires say inflate to 40 - 65 lbs, I inflated o 50 lbs and when my daughter (110lbs) rode the bike about 20 feet the rear tube exploded. Llego a tiempo,  facil de ensamblar,  es muy bonita,  peroooo.... al momento de armarla tuvimos problema con los pedales,  estaban muy duros de entrar para atornillar al Punto que uno de los pedales no entra derecho queda totalmente desnivelado.<br>Entonces tuve que comprar pedales adicionales para que queden de manera correcta.<br>Pienso que los pedales tuvieron un error de fabricacion que quizas no se ha presentado en otras ventas.<br>En resumen la bicicleta costo mas de lo vendido por la compra extra de pedales.<br><br>Aparte de eso hasta este momento no se le ha visto otro inconveniente y la verdad el diseño es bonito. I’m 5’8” tall and I feel like this bike is boarder line too small for me, but it will work for now. You need about 6 different tools to assemble it. My husband put it together pretty easy, but the front brakes were a pain. You will want to buy a new seat as the seat it comes with is the most uncomfortable bike seat I have ever sat on. Hard as a rock and small. The bike looks nice, colors are bright and vibrant. It’s a basic bike. Nothing special about it. The bike works fine and went together without too much hassle but after unboxing it and getting it put together it honestly looks like a used bike. I guess I would blame shipping and how the manufacturer packaged the bike but the front reflector was broke off, the bottom of the seat was rubbing on something causing the fabric to tear, one of the wheel spokes was noticeably bent, there are several locations on the wheels and chassis of the bike where the paint is worn off due to rubbing, some of the decals are bubbling up. I guess when someone buys something new they expect it to look new, in that regard I was severely disappointed. While assembly of the front wheel, handlebars, seat and pedals was simple enough, the bike was FAR FROM ready to ride. Nothing was tuned properly. I had to spend hours adjusting everything from brake pads, brake lines, derailleurs, etc.<br><br>Furthermore, the seat is rock hard. Even after adjusting as much as possible, shifting gears is still challenging.<br><br>Given the price, I would have expected a more “ready to ride” and “comfortable ride.” Got this bike for my teen son. We got it together but the seat was so hard he was disappointed cuz he can't ride far and sit. I'll be buying a bike seat cushion for it. I'm an avid bike rider and my bikes usually last at least 3 years. When I saw this pink bike, I knew I had to have it! However, on my first ride out I noticed it was a lot heavier than my previous ride. It took way more energy to go the same distance as usual for me. After about 2 or 3 rides I would have to add air to the tires. They lost way too much air each ride out. Then on about my 5th ride out, I got a flat tire 3 miles from home! Ugh ~ new bike should have thicker tires without the worry of getting a flat. I feel like perhaps I just got a \"lemon\" and I sure hope most of these bikes don't have similar problems. Had it a month and the bars that hold the pedals on become loose, fell off, and it's unusulabe! It's my teenage sons way to get to and from school and he can't use it now! The bike was all there and very easy to assemble. my only complaint is the gooseneck where the handlebars attach is welded on crooked. Turned it into an ebike, for anyone planning on converting it does not have mounting holes on the main frame so you will have to use a rack or a frame bag; also get a new seat because stock is gonna hurt you. Handle bars come loose, and I can't crank the wrench anymore. Seat wasn't very comfortable. Had to completely reset the brake system to have it function properly. My daughter needed a bike for a class at her private school on safety and her cool old classic failed the safety test so I ordered this one so it would get here before the next week's class as she had to sit out. She LOVES this bike.. is 11.. an active kid. I can't review it other than saying it was so simple to put together and hasn't broken with a sorta big 5'6\" TALL 11 yr old...  and she loves it so there's your review! The chair is not comfort and when you want to make turn your feet hit the wheel . It was very well assembled. Thank you. Of course I wasn't expecting anything too great out of a relatively cheap bike, but this is the first time I'm actually sending something back. The general comfort and feel of the bike isn't great. The seat is not all that great, the handlebar grips are a little small, and you tend to feel every little bump and vibration despite having a \"front suspension.\" I also had trouble with gears skipping and even the local bike mechanic could only improve it a little. Then there's the brakes, they are not very reliable. Even after tightening them, they lose performance over just a few miles. The worst part was that, I'm guessing due to the cheap material, one pedal actually ruined the socket. When I looked, the pedal bolt was fine, but the socket was completely wrecked. The pedal came off a couple of miles from home and I had to walk back. I'm now waiting for my refund. The original seat not that comfortable, need to change to a wider seat. I bought it for me as a Christmas gift and let me tell you this bike had me exhausted but I know the more I ride it and get used to it and the better I feel after a workout Heavy. Too slow and very difficult to go up small hills. Does not respond to Changing gears. Bad breaks. I bought this bike because of good reviews,  but either I am unlucky customer or something wrong with the reviews. It took my neighbor 15min to put together with no problems. It felt really good to ride a bike again at 63 yrs old. Bike trails here I come!!! ! Would be 5 stars all around. But it’s a midnight blue color and I hate blue. I ordered black. Odd thing is blue is not an option. Only keeping it because it’s a very dark blue and don’t want the hassle. My daughter wanted to learn how to bike and she is currently using this bike. She likes it, but the components are pretty cheap. I guess this is what you get for less than $200. Only thing I found wrong with it is a few tiny holes in the seat other that that it’s perfect. Put it together and rode it works great 👍🏻 Every part of this bike is cheap. Fell apart almost instantly. Didn't last the month. Easy to assemble, gears and brakes were put on incorrectly, had to adjust. Gears... frustration, frustration left gear will only go to 2, go beyond that and then grinds and grinds. Right even in 6th there is no enough tension loose pedaling. Going down hills there is no tension... Have adjusted and still no high gears, got a slight more change in left shifter. Hopefully additional adjustments will help, otherwise - RETURN - BACK IT GOES!!!! ! It’s a great bike but the seat is uncomfortable Bike arrived well packed and had decent instructions. Assembled the bike in less than 30 mins and tried to take it around the block for a test ride. Here’s where the issues started, chain came off multiple times and eventually the tensioner on the back became entangled in a spoke causing an abrupt stop (like broom handle through tire almost over the bars stop). Ok I’m up for a challenge, maybe I missed a step in assembly and walked the bike back to evaluate. Once back I confirmed no steps were missed and got the bike going and still persisted to have chain issues. The final straw was turning and pedaling or lack there of. There is not enough rake on the bike and the front tire is 6” from the pedals which comes as a shock to someone not expecting it, especially someone with a size 13 shoe! Sending this one back and spending a few bucks more on a different bike. The bike works but the seat is really uncomfortable and no matter how much we tighten the handle bars they still move and my daughter has to always fix them everytime she rides. Brakes are not very good, seat was AWFUL, its a cheap bike don't put expectations very high. please send me missing manual book. My Lil Brother loves his birthday gift. Great height for taller me. I’ve had this bike for a couple of months now and I’m seeing things that are wearing out faster than I thought the pedal I had to replace just seet I had to replace It was missing screws I had to buy myself tires are cheap I have to constantly air them every week it not flat but it low it could’ve been better And didn’t come with any tools you can buy something better than this Also there’s no one 800 number to call and complain about this when it comes to the company This bike is great quality. Sure, it isn’t as light as a road bike...maybe because it isn’t a road bike. It’s a mountain bike and it feels strong and sturdy. Assembly was mindless and easy. Front and rear derailleur needed tuning upon first ride, which is normal. The brakes also had to be adjusted which was relatively easy done alone. 5 stars, especially at this great affordable price. The searched the box and could not find the assemble tool. The tip of the brake cable for front wheel fell off during the assembling. Ok for $. Black is actually blue and arrived with the emblem on the front coming off. Other than that seems ok for my son who is 13. The bike is fine. Feels a little small, but I haven't ridden for a while. The gears grind on the 2nd level and won't even get to the highest level. I spent two hours putting on a new extra comfortable seat, lock, rack on the back, filling the tires, putting on the front wheel, etc. Now I have to return it? I'm very dissapointed. It seems most things I buy from Amazon are junk that last couple of years. WTH is going on? Something needs to be done about the braking system on this bike. To install the front tire, the brakes need to be taken loose. When I did this, the cap shot off the end of the cable. I can not get the cable back through the hole in the set screw. This is insane. I need to look the company up that makes this bike and see if I can get a replacement cable. Y'all need to go back to the side pull brakes. Also, the valves on the tires do not accept a slandard pump valve. Not only do I have to replace the front brakes, but I now need to replace both inner tubes. I may as well buy a new bike. When we took the bike out of the box, one of the reflectors was completely smashed. Not a big deal, but annoying for a brand new item. We read all of the instructions and it still took a day and a half to completely get it ready to ride. The front brakes were installed crooked so they rubbed the tire, and the cables had to be taken apart to get the brakes to function correctly. The cable going to one of the handlebars wasn't even attached so one of our friends had to take it apart to fix that. If we didn't have a large selection of tools and handy friends, we would have never gotten this thing safe to ride for our son. Crappy quality and would not recommend. Couldn’t return it due to the box got damaged while taking it out of the box so I took it to a bike shop to get the brake lines replaced due to poor quality. While there they pointed out that both tire rims were bad, the back inner tube wasn’t holding air and the chain mechanism on the back tire is bent! Poor quality and who ever put it together didn’t know what they doing! Very poor workmanship! Bike arrived out of box with bent back rim. We had to adjust it and bend it back which took much longer to put together. Bike is basic, but for the price, it’s as Expected. No bells and whistles. Seat is terribly uncomfortable after only a few minutes of riding it. Ok bike for now. If you ride a lot, go with another bike. Me encanto y muy buena a mi niño le gustó mucho 🥰 Came with no instructions and missing a part for the brakes in front otherwise no complaints Got this bike for 14-year-old son. It was a great buy. He loves it. It's pretty sturdy. Had to adjust the shifting and adjust the brakes Grandson lives out from town on 18 acres and the bike is great on trails through the woods, on gravel driveway, and through the yard. Keeps them active. Thanks Easter Bunny The bike came with the usual pieces needing assembly (seat, bars, pedals, front wheel). The pre-assembled components were tight and accurate. A breeze if you know bikes, supplied instructions will guide those who don't.<br><br>The bike rides well. Got my friend a bigger, more comfortable seat (inexpensive on Amazon). This bike is a no-brainer at this price. … Both wheels were bent. I was able to straighten it out a little bit. The brakes are hard to adjust to the right setting and there isn’t much literature on how to adjust them. It came in about a week and a half, so for having prime, it came later than expected. It only took me an hour to get the bike ready to ride and it’s a pretty decent bike so far. For the money, the bike is better than most $500+ bikes.<br>Easy assembly, easy gear shifting, adjustable seat and handle bars, etc. Before you purchase,  give real consideration to several reviews which mentions front rim bent. I assumed some were exaggeration but they were 100% correct! Had to buy another rim as the bend was not fixable. You guessed right..manufacturer refused to reimburse so BUYER BEWARE! This bike comes with a bent front rim. I love the bike, easy to ride and maneuver for a middle-aged person!! The seat was too hard, had to buy a seat cushion, but I love it for exercising and just having fun! Great price too! ! Nice bike but instructions were very hard to understand and was very hard to assemble Bike was too small. Definitely not for a woman. A Little girl to 14years yes The wheels were bent. Had to take it to a local bike repair shop before riding it Needs full tensioner and brake adjustments. Its a good bike for price but not easy to assemble. Also, the bike seat is very hard. used it for like 1-2 mile and it was a painful ride afterwords. Wish they could change the seat. Otherwise its a great bike in budget.

            "Reviews:   Picky husband likes it. Good quality, fits well and looks nice. Enough is said! Just a nice hat, nice quality and seems like it will last. Excellent fit, stylish. ***** Such an amazing hat for the summer! If you can’t tell the stripes of the American Flag are fish! Yes! Fish! *****<br>- It’s got the curve cut out so it doesn’t hurt your ears. My husband LOVES it. HOWEVER, we did get it on Prime day overnight and I do believe that’s the only reason the hat was in great shape because it comes in a bag not a box. If you have this out for a week delivery I can almost guarantee you the hat will be crushed.<br>- just some delivery info from my own personal experience Feels good, excellent performance, as expected.. My husband purchased this hat for 4th of July. The quality of the material is great, and I love that it is size adjustable so it will practically anyone! The hat looks great and is high quality, only problem is that the brim is pretty off-center with the middle seam. Loved and good for a gift I looked for a while for a hat I liked. Columbia is an easy choice as I always wear my husband and son’s Columbia hats. I wanted a light but neutral color so I opted for a tan front/white mesh sides. I like the hat therefore I gave it 4 stars. I only wish it was clear it was a high crown hat. I probably would not have purchased it if I had known. I tend to wear this so it covers my ears to avoid it sitting high on my head. All in all I like the hat despite it being high crown (no reviews stated this but I should have looked at the images). Hat was nicely made, good quality. I was surprised it was shipped in a see through plastic bag (no protection), but it didn’t have any damage. Es grande pero es buena calidad I love the fabric, great quality stitching is nice Excelente producto, 100% recomendado Súper linda, mejor que en la imagen, la calidad se nota!! ! Love the colors and the flag design of all these Columbia hats. This color stands out nicely and I like the snap back. La mejor Got it for my boyfriends bday and he loved it. My boyfriend is in law enforcement and is a fisherman so this was the absolute perfect gift for himMy boyfriend is in law enforcement and is a fisherman so this was the absolute perfect gift for him Muy rápido y en un impecable estado Gran diseño You can never go wrong with this brand of hats for style. This hat barely fits my head at the loosest fitting! Great color choices. The fit is perfect but the detail patch is what sold me. Will buy again. Super lindo, entrega a tiempo, material perfecto Me gusto, la eh usado bastante y hasta la eh mojado y sigue con su mismo color. Genial esta gorra, es comoda, fresca y muy linda, de excelente calidad de construcción Was a gift my son lovedit Fits great and looks just like picture Gave this as a gift to an older teen who likes to fish. He loved it. Excelente calidad I bought this hat for my dad for a Christmas gift. He loved it and fit well on his head. Great colors too, I bought a PFG shirt for him to match these colors. Gave as a gift and very happy with the quality Material is great and it’s nicely made. But it fits awkwardly in the front. Great product, fast shipping Great fit. Just as described Great quality. Teen boy loved it. Muy bonita Great hat This hat was on my head all summer long. One of my new favorites. It’s lightweight and fits perfectly. Enjoyed using it while fishing and kayaking. Pleased I purchased this hat for my husband. He loves this hat! It's well made and looks great. This hat looks to be well made and fits. Me encanto el diseño, marca y colores del gorro. También me gusto la rapidez del envío. Se ajusta perfectamente con Gran comidad, estás gorras están hechas de muy buena calidad. Continuare comprando este producto. I picked this up for $14 so I was very pleased. Seems like very good quality. It’s new so can’t speak of durability quite yet Awesome hat me gusto el producto, acorde a lo solicitado well build and feels good on my head.... had to add my rugness touches ... lovin it more now. Excelente. Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves to fish so he loved the design. Great quality hat. High quality and better price than in the store Fast good price This is all my hubby wears and looks great! Nothing Best hat I’ve ever owned!! ! Great hat Just like purchasing from Dicks Sporting goods! Get it I am a hat snob,these fit great,I have purchased several Fits great and very well made. This is my go to hat After wearing the hat 5 times it became discolored. The discoloration was about an inch in both directions on the back of the bill and the front of the hat. It was not due to sweat. Got as a gift for dad he loved it super cute and durable Excelente Excelente se ajusta perfectamente, buena calidad I love this. It’s a Christmas present for my dad. HOWEVER, it came in a bag. Anyone that is a hat person knows that’s a crappy way to ship something. Or store something as far as hats because they can get messed up easily and smashed. It wasn’t smashed but I think a little box would be better just for preventative reasons. I had to find my own box to put it in that would be roomy enough but not too big, to wrap to gift it. Which is fine!! Not a huge deal just as a person with a fiancé that is has a hat obsession, I know better than to put a hat in harms way hahaha Love the color, thought it was low crown Good product, just not well managed for packaging by the time I got the hat it was completely squished.. Awesome hat! Cant go wrong with these hats Very nice hat great quality My husband played baseball from early until post college so he has always had a hat near him, a few years ago he started looking into hats that were more breathe-able and we found this one, it is now his most worn hat ever. He loves the look, and although is not a fisherman gets many compliments on it often. Exelente product My 14yr old loves americana stuff and fishing. He wears this hat almost daily and loves it. Exactly as described and fit perfectly. Grandson loved it. It came in 2 days Is your wife tired of you getting looks because you're a beautiful dad? When you leave the house does she look at you and say \"hey why do you look like that leaving the house\" This hat says I'm taken and I'm a dad more than anything. Never again does she have to worry. This is basically like wearing her on your head. Husbands just turn all this around if you want to show everyone she is taken. The hat says it all. Fish, the American flag, the trucker hat? YOU ARE SET! All jokes aside I love this hat and my daughter likes it too. my boyfriend loved this hat and loved the fact it has the snap buttons in the back so he can adjust it to his head. i would buy this again! Came just as it looks and as I read I wear hats almost everyday and I was in the market for a new one. The fish themed flag on the front of this hat caught my eye so I decided to purchase it.<br><br>This SnapBack fit my head very well—it’s snug enough to not fall off, but also doesn’t me discomfort. The material is good quality and has not shown any signs of easy staining yet.<br><br>My only complaint is the side tags. The tags on the side are quite large and look almost like an advertisement on the side of my head. There is no way to remove them or cut them off without ruining the netting of the hat. The front of the hat looks good, but the sides not so much in my opinion. Husband likes it Nice hat. Fits as expected. Nice hat. Got for a gift but came in a bag instead of a box and was completely crushed and mangled I was happy to find this hat. My favorite character from the show \"Seal Team\" (Sonny Quinn) wore it a lot in the 1st season of the show and when I saw it I wanted it. Luckily I managed to find it. Fits well, holds it's shape, the mesh does not seem to be cheaply made. Wear it almost every day. Fantastic quality Lo máximo en gorras... Columbia 100% Gave it to my son. He loved it. Fits well too Super cute and irs my go to hat ! My son loved this hat that I gave him for Christmas. Came fast and in perfect condition. This is really nice quality and comfortable. Arrived quickly. I have a pretty big head, and this hat was JUST too small by about an inch or two. The quality of the material and design are great and the fit is close but the cap part just is not deep enough, regardless of how I adjust the snap backs. The similar model of this have that I’ve bought in the past were flex fit. They would fully fit on my head much better. I do, however like the SnapBack design better. I bought another Columbia snap back similar to this but fishing flag, so we'll see if that one is too small as well. Keep the snap back design bit maybe make a bigger size. Bought this for my guy as a present he hasn’t taken it off since great material definitely great gift for any male in the family I have this hat to my hubs for his birthday. He loves it! We are a very patriotic family and love most things with an American Flag on it. It was a great purchase. Bought for my son and he loved it! My fiancé absolutely loves this! I got it for him for his birthday and he says it’s his favorite now. It’s exactly what it looks like. The fit is good, the color is exact. It’s a really cool hat. So many compliments, great hat!<br>Highly recommend! I like so much this hat. Perfect fit and comfort. It was delivered before I expected. Packaging was very good. No damage or bend it. good for fishing love it Muy bueno, me gustó Very nice hat to work in. The American flag on it is Sewn in and makes it feel very well made. It’s washable durable and patriotic! :) Hat will have terrible sweat stains after 1-2 times sweating in it. Have multiple friends that have purchased PFG hats and they all have the same issue.\n",

            "Reviews:   Best wipes in my opinion. And a great price for this pack!!!! Way better than purchasing in store! Texture is soft, they don’t rip easily and they don’t have any weird scents or smells. We’ve been using these for years, and they are fantastic! They are soft and durable and they are easy on the bottom. Even though they are marketed as flushable, we just toss in the garbage because of our community wastewater collection. Apparently, they are not good for the system. These are my favorite brand of flushable wipes! Of course using flushable wipes helps you feel so much fresher after using the bathroom but this brand specifically works really well. Some other brands have been irritating to my skin but not this one! The thickness, texture and durability is great compared to other brands too. They do an excellent job! I also love the travel size packages. They are perfect for travel and on the go. I would recommend these! These Cottonelle wipes are a great addition to any bathroom. Let’s face it…..not every poop comes with a clean break. Sometimes you need a little more than normal toilet paper to feel clean. These wipes will do the trick! Thick enough so that your finger won’t go through and wet enough, but not so wet that your bum leaves your pants looking like you had an accident. I would highly recommend them! Easy, breezy, lemon squeezy for a sparkly clean rump! Smells really good but falls apart when you try taking one out of the package most likely because they are flushable so that's OK. I recommend these for a nice clean booty After pooping! ! These wipes are thick and durable. They come in an 8 pack. The price is very fair compared to buying them at a grocery store! They have a nice flip top lid and thick packing that does not rip. I really loved how well they worked for any cleaning job we've came across. The size is perfect for keeping on hand for a quick hand wash, gentle enough for washing your face and tender bottoms, no matter how big the job is, your covered. Perfect for bedbound love ones and their caretakers, when you can wash your hands anytime you need it's really helpful to keep the spread of germs down!<br>It's nice to be able to freshen up any time you want to, even when you're mobility makes it impossible to get to up and go wherever and whenever great for when traveling,stay wet,easy to get out,  soft but strong, great sent This product is 5 star and nothing less!!! Unless you have a allergic reaction which is a personal issue and not a product issue.<br><br>Now everyone saying they are too small, to thin, tear easily etc.. LISTEN CAREFULLY TO THIS 1 SIMPLE STEP!....<br><br>JUST FOLD IT IN HALF!!! Done problem solved.<br><br>P.S<br>If you got a pick up or dump truck as your rear end these might not be for you or any wipes honestly! All love though! Lol🤣 I accidentally bought these--not sure how--but I'm glad I did. I needed them on my recent trip to India for the in-ground squat toilets I encountered between cities. These toilets had no toilet paper, so it was helpful to break out the Cottonelle wipes. I also found them cool and refreshing in 117-degree temperatures. They smell nice, so I used them as body wipes when I felt sticky and gross. Best of all, they're made of thick paper so they're biodegradable. I definitely intend to buy more. Finally, I have found a wet wipe that is superior to all others. I have tried probably 6 other brands. All of them come out in clumps of 3 or 4 at a time. Occasionally only one will come out. Now, I have Cottonelle wipes and they come out only one at a time. They are square and soft and gentle. It's a plus that they are flushable. Thank you Cottonelle for making these far superior wet wipes. Good product they use to be 60 count now 45 I didn't notice when I purchased them again if I had I would not have bought them again everyone is down sizing and that sucks for the people buying products I use these everywhere, bathroom for quick refresh, I keep some in a baggy in my purse especially useful when going out to eat and I have to use my hands like with a hamburger. Overall very good. I would prefer that companies used compostable plastic or waxed paper cartons or something compostable for small packaging like this. Hopefully soon in the future everything will be compostable or recyclable. Had to do a colonoscopy prep this week and it was rather harsh on the backside. These wipes (and Vaseline) saved the day.<br>Usually, I use them before and after handling computers in the lecture hall, or sitting in communal seating in the lecture halls. I keep a package in the car and any purse or backpack I use. Great when I don’t have access to soap and water. These are great...small enough to travel with too. The multi-pack allows you to put them in every bathroom so you never run out. The snap top keeps them from drying out versus a top that just has that tape on the top. I will always buy the snap top now just for that reason. These wipes are light-weight and easy to use on any part of the body. I use them for adults and kids. My one complaint is that every 5-10 wipes ends up ripping when it's taken out of the container. You can use them to clean stinky armpits after sports practice, wipe off bug spray after a day of hiking, or for your bum. Either way, the liquid dries quickly. The box I purchased was 8 flip top packs with 42 wipes in each pack. Great product. Soft and durable. Great value for the price. Also doesn't contain aloe which I have an allergen to. I was told by our septic tank worker, not to flush because they are stored wet and don't break down so you will have to throw these wipes away if you have a septic tank but they are really comfortable. I always feel so much cleaner after using these wipes (over normal toilet paper). I have never had a bad experience with this company or brand (I have bought these before). I use at home but mostly when I have to use public restrooms. Great to have in the car for many other reasons as well. Living in Florida my nightmare is bugs in the car....don't ever want them. Flushable good size and no in store purchase best way to buy! No scent and don't burn. Hope my review helps? We always have some in the car, in a back pack for emergencies, we take these when we travel. They are something that we always keep stocked in our house. Have used other brands and they are not as durable as these. These are also great when camping, or if you just need to wipe your hands after eating in the car. After a very bad experience with Charmin. Charmin of the 40 you got in each package I lost at least 15 the first time. Opening is too small either 2 or 3 come out at a time. Cottenell Opening is much larger wipes come out one at a time. Wipes are bigger and even smell better. Thank you Cottenell I have bought large quantities but they never go dry. Large enough for use and easy on the skin without irritation Love them, easy to open and to carry, good price. I will continue buy them. No my orden then too 😃 I’ve used these for a month with no issue in my RV. They breakdown quickly. I use to take a hospital bath at home when I am restricted from normal bathing or showers. The only bad feature is that they are not flushable. I use wet wipes to wipe my Dane’s booty after he poops. Of all the wipes I’ve tried, I found these to be slightly thinner than others. Other brands I could get away with one but this one I like to use 2-3 to be safe. Great for travels but goes fast bc they’re thin. When I double up the durability is good but one piece? Be careful.. The Wet Wipes are great because its soft, flushable, and easy to use. Has a top closure that keeps it fresh. This is my new go to wipes. These are the best brand. They are easy to pull out and don’t fall apart. Must have in the restroom. I was looking for gentle wipes that were flushable and these get the job done. The only downside is they are scented but it isn’t too overpowering and i haven’t had any issues whatsoever. They work good, sometimes tear when taking out of the package like they are really packaged tightly, otherwise great product! As advertised. No problem with delivery or product. Same as if I purchased in the store. These wet wipes are great for resin projects also for hygiene uses. We have ordered several times , they do not clog your tolite. We keep them in all the bathrooms and we take a pack when traveling. Will always reorder when we run low I like that they’re easy to pack for travel or for at-home use. Not flimsy, yet soft. Don't flush if you have a septic tank. No issues for my sensitive skin. Good for traveling. My favorite wipes! They stay wet for a long period of time even if you happen to leave the lid opened. They hold up well and they perform just the way you need them too. Would be nice if they had a larger size available as well. But I can deal I purchase them before I'm even out I can't go without them! These are my favorite brand. They work best with the septic tank, they are soft and eco friendly. Very soothing. I carry them with me. because they are refreshing Very good quality Works and cleans Good product; timely delivery An absolute necessity for personal hygiene. This brand is \"wetter\" than store brands which is great! This wipes are great and there flushable so easy to use. These are the next best thing to a bidet. If you are only using paper like a Neanderthal, treat your booty hole to a wipe with these and become enlightened. Opened my package late - there were 6 packs inside instead of 8 like the box states. Great product The wipes are nice but the package are to small. It worth I use this in the bathroom instead of toilet paper and they work great They stay fresh I just love these wipes. I have been purchasing them through subscribe and save for over a year now. They are just the right size for an adult to use. They are soft and scented softly with a light fragrance. I have not had any issues with plumbing at all. I recommend these to people that love to feel fresh after using the bathroom. They are a great value for the money. They never dry out since they have a snap closure instead a sticky flap. Delivery and shipping is just right and always on time. Comes in handy and has a nice smell Very good to clean yourself on the go The are a good size, moist enough to do the job but not too wet. They have a clean scent. We use a lot of these, so we really like these. Love these wipes, just right in every way. Used for a quick cleanup where a shower is not going to happen in the timeframe needed. Nice product These wipes are strong and have a wonderful scent i’m very sensitive in that area and i didn’t realize they were scented so watch out for that! Excellent wipes for individual with medical situation. I wouldn't trust my bum to any other wet wipe! These are our go to for a clean feeling after a bathroom break. Tissue alone just doesn't cut it, but Cottonelle wipes do! Great texture, right amount of wetness, and it doesn't tear during use. These wipes do a great job cleaning that area- the texture is perfect and the scent is nice. Great package size and super convenient to store because they aren’t so big. Will re-order for sure Comes in hand at all time These are not to bad. Be carefully they are a little thinner than the ones I am used to. Don't want to poke through and end up with a stinky finger. Handy for the whole family for the quick bathroom cleanup. I like ease of use, towletts stay wet good size Best thing happening when your on the road and you need to make a pit stop They are totally flushable!! ! I love this product My go to wipes No dislikes on product Good product,  wish was a little bigger Are you tired of the same old routine in the bathroom? Feel like your hygiene game needs a makeover? Well, welcome to the wet wipe wonderland, my friends, and let me introduce you to the Cottonelle Freshfeel Flushable Wet Wipes—a game-changer in the world of bathroom bliss!<br><br>I never knew I needed a wet wipe until I tried these little miracles.

I mean, who doesn't want their bathroom to smell like a field of lavender after a rainstorm?

Trust me; your derriere will thank you for this luxurious experience!<br><br>Happy wiping! Would definitely recommend Durable, and perfect to clean anything. Had some problems grabbing wipes out of the package. Sometimes they would rip in half as I was trying to grab one out of the packaging. Smell is nice and they work well overall. Could be a little thicker Bien pero pensé que era paquetes más grandes. Los normales Good product Love them I like the wipes but wish it was a little on the bigger side I like wipes but these are definitely a cut above the rest! This is now my new brand of wipes! They are plush and do a way better job. Will definitely buy again! I recently purchased the Cottonelle Fresh Feel Flushable Wet Wipes and appreciate the large quantity provided. The 8 flip-top packs with a total of 336 wipes is a great value, and the packaging is convenient for keeping the wipes fresh and moist.<br><br>The wipes themselves are effective and refreshing, making them a good choice for personal hygiene. They are flushable, which adds a level of convenience for use in the bathroom.<br><br>However, I have encountered a couple of issues with this product. First, the wipes tend to tear easily when being removed from the package, which can be quite frustrating. Second, I experienced a stinging sensation upon initial use. This discomfort was unexpected and somewhat concerning.<br><br>If the durability of the wipes could be improved to prevent tearing and the formula adjusted to be gentler on sensitive skin, this would be an excellent product. As it stands, while the wipes are effective and the quantity is generous, these issues are significant downsides. Perfect for my needs Sometimes you need this to really get clean as opposed to wiping and wiping and wiping and wiping. As described. Good container - better resale than other brands. I will continue to buy this product. These are my favorite wipes overall! They work great, they’re a lot more durable than other brands. The size of each wipe is great! Not too soapy/wet. They’re textured, which helps. I love them. This works fine and clean very well if you use two wipe instead of one. Works great Great purchase for restroom use. Its soft on the skin and cleans well. the flushable wipes make clean up easy and efficient. Also, priced reasonably for the amount of product you receive. No issues with shipping/handling. Only thing I would say is that sometimes the wipes are a little too wet. Best wipes I've found and the only ones I use. soft  like toilet paper Easy to pull out without taking half the pkg with one. Soft &amp; flushable. Would recommend over other brands! For me it’s not for everyday use but for power outages. This product is great. They are easy, soft and flushable. The only issue that I have with them is that the packaging is hard to open. I would recommend them to anyone looking for good wipes for any occasion. The wipes are soft and wet enough. The best part is they are flushable. They are great for traveling.\n",

            "Reviews:   For the price it's really hard to beat it. Looks good, casts good smooth to reel in. It s nice little setup. Very easy to take along in any vehicle. I love this rod! It is something I keep in my vehicle or take on my e-bike anytime I am going down to the harbor.<br><br>I am in SoCal, so there's always a bit of fishing I can partake in. Mainly, I fish from jetties and piers, sometimes the shore.<br><br>This is far from my nicest/fanciest rod setup, but it is dependable and easy to setup and get to fishing.<br><br>The finish on the reel is incredible for the money. The rod is carbon fiber and is very strong for the size.<br><br>I have had good luck fishing 8 lb halibuts and bonito, I enjoy having a simple setup in my kit to get to fishing quickly!<br><br>Update: Feb 2024- the rod is still reeling in fish! Just landed a great Rainbow trout and wanted to share the video I managed while bringing her in. For $35, this isnt a bad little kit. Unboxing is very pleasing and all the individual components feel great; nice reel, 14.5kg test line(31 ish pound test), even the rod and little tackle box. Even has lures that ive never really seen or tried before. The eyelet protector when its collapsed is a bonus too. Nice smooth cast. The pole feels a little weird, never had one in this material and bafflingly light. Havent caught anything yet, not even a bite today so the action on the rod is untested. I do recommend saving the 30lbs test it comes with for a larger reel and stringing it with something lighter as the line is to stiff for the reel size. Buddy kept getting his caught around the reel bearing and mine would throw a birds nest from time to time. Note to the manufacturer: make the strap on the eyelet protector just a hair longer so it can still be strapped with the reel attached.<br><br>All and all, not a bad purchase for $35, still plenty of useful stuff here even if something does go south on me later. Bought this as a gift for Father's Day and am so glad I did. This set comes with a black bag that is perfect for traveling, and you are able to make the fishing pole smaller to fit in there. Comes with a whole bunch of necessities and we cannot wait to give it a try. Just think about why it's so cheap.<br>This rod is starting to fall apart after using few times. I ended up bought a new wheels for it. I only gave them 3 stars because of that.<br>But the company reached out to me and sent me a new set of rod so I'm going to give another chance to this product.<br>I have to say tho this company really do cares for customers experience about their product and impressing for customer service. Bought this as a travel rod for vacation and use it regularly. Fits well in the bag and works very well for a set at this price point. While fishing, the glue that holds the eyelets, &amp; poles together, came off &amp; disintegrated with water.<br><br>Trash I of course had some doubts with the rod, but as soon as I took it to fish for the first time, all the doubts were erased. The rod’s retractability made it easy to love around and set up. Once I got the rod, the set up was easy because it came with a video provided with the company. Overall, since I am not a pro fisher but just an average guy who fishes for the fun of it, the rod was worth the money. Nice for a starting fisherman This fishing pole allowed me to catch not only this tiny fish, but many others as well! I'm a beginner who knows very little, so perhaps some of my struggles are my own unique fumbles; however, I've had some trouble with the reel. Like getting line on. Keeping line on. Sometimes line catching when I cast. Again, I think that's more user error than a design flaw. Because of the telescoping feature, it's a tad cumbersome at the handle. Still, it gets 5 stars for being so easy to travel with and relatively easy to use for this clueless creature. If you're a complete novice, you may want to findable with a closed reel. Arrived quickly . In good condition. Product looks very good the reel seems good quality, have not fished with it yet, but very happy with the purchase. Got it for grandson to teach him to use open faced reel and artificial baits. Will most likely buy another one. This portable fishing pole is pretty amazing. This is the first time I used a telescoping pole and it's flexible and sturdy. It stayed extended firmly and kept good contact with the fish I caught. It handled the fish pictured @ 2 pound Bass with no problem. The spinning reel is responsive with a good drag system. Kinda cool the pole and reel came with a small tackle box with some tackle and fishing line. The fishing line provided is sturdy but stiff on the reel and wants to recoil on the cast and birdnest so I will replace it with a more familiar fishing line. All in all, I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this LineRike setup for those who want to learn to fish a spinning setup and those who are experienced. Can't wait to latch into some larger fish with this rig and experience it's performance. Thanks LineRike 👍 Please, make sure to send an intacte package. Got this for vacation in a remote place. First cast the reel broke. No fishing pole the rest of the time. Save your money! This was a Christmas present for my grandson in the Navy. Space is a critical issue for someone in the Navy. This fishing kit came in a compact case that provided him everything he needed during his off hours to allow him to fish. The size allows him to store it snuggly in corner of his car trunk when it is not in use. Light weight and easy to use. Good for beginners This pole is nice and compact. Shrinks down very small and seems to work well. The pole itself is heavy duty and seems strong, but because it is so stiff it makes it hard to feel the little things. The reel is loud but it works. The issue I have is that my pole came without the lower cap on the bottom so when it is collapsed it all falls out the bottom.. overall good for beginners with limited room for storage. Would not purchase again. This is a really nice fishing pole especially for the price, my son cant wait to use it and likes the wooden handle on the reel. It looks very easy to use and assemble and you can watch a video on how to assemble it. It comes with a carrying case also. My son kept looking at these for a while, so we finally got one. It is really a nice package. I wouldn't mind getting one for myself. Comes with a nice carry bag. Seems strong enough. The reel and pole construction and materials seem good enough for everything we are doing. Love that we can retract it for easy transport. I don't know much about fishing, but seems good to me. The perfect “grown up” combination for my 9yr old grandson’s birthday. He can’t wait to wet the hook. And, with the travel case, he is already talking about which lake we will go to when he comes for a visit. He loves it and that’s all that counts. Will update as I get more use out of it. After setup, three of the eyelets we're lose and ha slipped off their section of rod. I don't expect them to stay just from me shoving them back on. Initial thoughts is three stars. Would be 4 if it wasn't already 'broken' before first use. No well written instructions for a pure beginner. Great concept but, if your not fishing in a pond I wouldn’t recommend. Pretty easy to assemble. Can’t wait to get out to the lake and use it. light rod and good quality.<br>It is difficult to wind line into reel.<br>I am worried too light to catch big fish.<br>Anyway it is the best for beginner. I like the included carrying bag for the rod. However the reel mount isn’t very secure and when I was reeling in a small trout the reel kept wiggling around, it felt like it was going to come off. I zip tied the reel to the rod and now I’m fairly impressed, I guess. I wanted to put some time in with this rod and reel combo. Honestly I am impressed with the quality and strength of the rod. I’ve bought many telescoping rods and this rod is by far one of the best. I’d recommend this rod to anyone. Don’t hesitate to buy this, I don’t regret buying mine. I was impressed with the quality for the price! This pole is actually good I had my doubts but it’s awesome Bought this combo for my son. It is a good combo. Every thing worked as it should for a little while and then the rod broke. Very disappointed that it didn't last longer. I will buy another just not this brand. holes don’t even align they slide causing the gline to mess up Compact and good, works very good and it is well built, it does the job for a hobby. I got this for Father’s Day and it is a very nice rod. Especially convenient that it collapses so it doesn’t take up the hole car and the hooks don’t go flying everywhere. I need to get out and use it more. Good item for my grandson Great one to have, this is my favorite fishing rod and reel I ever had! Thank you very much for the high quality  I really needed and finally got a very good  fishing rod and reel  I was looking for, loved the product! Light compact lure rod combo looks 100$. Reel looks very high quality. Rod is hard, so big fish can be caught. On the other hand smaller lures like a few grams are hard to controll.<br>Keep this in trunk room of your car. We went fishing and broke I'm giving two stars because it casted alright when it was working, however after it's first initial use the reel kept coming loose so much soon that I ended up losing it while kayaking, however this wasn't the wrist part as it's a telescopic fishing pole that won't even close back up completely. On top of that the string eye came loose and I had to break the dam rod to return it because it refuses to close back up. Pics included No issues so far! Awesome quality product. Have nog tried it, but the quality looks good and it does come in a nice bag The worst thing happen to me possible. I just received the pole and opening it it dropped on my wooden floor and broke. So I went and bought another reel and casted for the first time and the first tip on the pole<br>Broke off. I wasted money and time on this just don’t waste your time. If anything they owe me a new one because the one I received was poor. Items match the description. This kit comes with all the basic fishing supplies and a carrier bag!! I bought it as a gift for my friend who is a beginner. He loves it! I really enjoyed this product. I like how portable it is. I have it stowed away in my truck Incase I want to do some fishing on my way home after work. I liked how it was small, came with everything you need for fishing, and came with its own bag! This budget friendly fishing combo was great for a beginner fisher! It broke the first day my son used it The rod is beautiful and the introduction video is easy to follow, the assembly process is easy to learn, looking forward it to have a good performance! Great for travel, I'm all set with two sets that fit in back of car. Takes up little space and I can fish almost anywhere. I Purchased this for my dad for Father’s Day, and he said it’s the best fishing pole he’s ever had. Thank you! ! I would recommend this fishing rod to novices, it is very simple to learn and it is very convenient to use. Tip comes off and top slider is stuck Easy-to-use, lightweight I haven't used it yet but it is exactly what I ordered and came in early. Beauitful set. After a few minutes figuring out how to get on the reel, my son was off and fishing. Thanks! I needed something compact for a bike tour. It comes with a case and accessories. I purchased this for my husband as a father day present and it broke in 2 months of using it. Total time he fished in two was about 5 times. So pretty much cheap and can't even hold a small mouth bass. Waste of money! Great compact fishing pole with enough accessories to get you fishing.<br>Easy to transport and setup.<br>Guy Like the way it works Was very easy to assemble! And good variety of beginner lures! My first pole!!! ! Good buy for your money. Nice thirteen bearing reel with a nice rod. This isn’t supposed to happen…. Used this rod less than 10 times and it began to deteriorate rather quickly. The handle began to come loose and then the rod literally snapped in my hands when I landed a fish. I’d give this zero stars if I could. My apologies to the manufacturer, but this product is the north end of a south bound mule. I liked it at first but the bolts keep coming lose and slideing down and top it off i was fishing and the top of the rod busted easily Bought this pole for a last minute fishing trip. Pole broke within hours of fishing. Not a sturdy pole. It was good till I got a hard bit then it broke right above the 3rd eye from the top Ready to fish now We gave this to my dad as a father's day gift. The good part is that he loved it,  but the sad news is after extending it once it did not retract again. He also tells us that the eyes are starting to fall off as well after that first use. I received 3 fishing rods that I had brought for my grandsons. They came with no directions so we are on vacation with the rods still in the box. We do not know how to put everything together. Not happy at all with this. Good quality product The item was much shorter than described. I do not recommend this product a small 2 pound fish destroyed the rod. Made with weak material, don’t fall for the free things they give as long as you do a good review they don’t send anything. It  sucked. The rod is a piece of junk. The reel seemed ok. Never tested since rod cross threaded reel retaining ring on the first use. Rubbish fishing rob, don't waste your money. I bought two, both were broken. Used twice and the hole thing came apart… just get a two piece rod works better and way more reliable Really Chinese Product was already opened and someone had tried to set up the reel…. Horribly Poor quality. Broke within an hour. Don’t buy. Not recommend My youngest son wanted to go fishing. Only Problem? I'm not a fisherman. I've been fishing with friends before but I cannot tell you what weight fishing line I was using or how to adjust the drag controls on the reel.<br><br>What I can tell you is that this is a really good deal for the money. The entire kit is very lightweight and easy to transport. It fits in a very small carrying case so you can keep this in your car and always have it at your disposal. It comes with just about everything you need to get started. And THAT is the main reason I was attracted to it. This is a kit that you can get started with without breaking the bank. Then you can learn the fishing craft and decide what you might want to upgrade to in the future.<br><br>For me, this was a great way to get started with fishing with a good basic telescoping rod and lightweight reel. I have no compulsions recommending this to someone (like me) who is just getting started and doesn't want to spend a ton of money to find out if fishing is right for you.<br><br>I am getting good use out of it and learning as I go. And my son has something to use when he comes to visit.<br><br>If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up. Thanks! This review is for the LineRike fishing pole. The pole itself is collapsible which allows it to be stored in a pretty small bag along with the rest of its accessories. It comes in a neat little carrying bag to contain everything for you. This would make a wonderful fishing pole to take hiking with you because of how compact and lightweight it is.<br><br>The rod itself is decent quality. Once extended it feels sturdy to me. The reel is surprisingly pretty nice as well. It works smoothly and I'm not sure what else I could want from it. Make sure you tighten things down well and it should work good for you.<br><br>I love that this is like a little fishing kit. It includes everything you need to get started or to keep a little kit in your car for when you go camping. They give you 100m of line to start out and get the pole ready for your first trip. They also include many different lures and baits here too.<br><br>Overall this is a really nice rod and reel for either your main or your backup. I don't think you will have any issues at all catching normal fish with this thing. If you step up to a fairly heavy fish then you might have issues. But for just your average fishing this works well in my eyes. Giving this three stars only because the rod I have already came apart. Meaning, the glue that held one of the bottom portions of the handle on simply unglued and slipped right off without much pulling on it. It was actually one of my sons attempts at simply opening the Rod up, to set up his rig.<br><br>Fixable with a little two-part Epoxy but it is currently waiting for attention from dad and hopefully he will find time!<br><br>Otherwise, I think for the price of the reel itself is excellent. Smooth and easy to operate. It actually has a little bit of a stiff feel to it when reeling in but for my son I think that’s perfect. It helps him moderate the speed with which he pulls in his Lors as we are primarily fishing on rivers.<br><br>There are a lot of different options out there for telescoping rods, and I just think the overall quality and design of this one is poor. Furthermore, I’ve never owned a fishing rod without foam or cork hardly at all in the handle area and while it makes it more compact, I really have decided I don’t like the lack of a true handle and even a telescoping rod. I recognize that for the price it’s a phenomenal deal - you get rod and reel as well as a little zippered pouch and a few other fishing supplies (which we will probably never use as trout fisherman). The reel seems to be okay. But it was used 2x. The first time the top eye snapped off. The second time used another snapped off.<br>Forgot it was broken amd it took awhile to rig up the top eye....finally \"fixed\" it...1st cast, a different eye snapped off We don't fish very often and this was for kids so an expensive set up wouldn't make much sense for us. For the occasional trip to the pond this fit the bill. The rod isn't the best I've ever used in my life but it's fairly decent and gets the job done. The lures worked fine, everything worked like it was supposed to. For a budget bundle for a child it was great. I was under the impression that it was for adults and kids but this is strictly for kids. It’s super tiny in my opinion. The rod is super skinny too but it does appear to retract to the 7 ft as advertised. It did however come with the included goodies which I can use for all my rods but I think I’ll save this rod for my 6 year old son. It's a really nice rod but the reel kept getting tangled. I spent more time untangling the line than I did fishing with it. A breeze to transport due to its' light weight and ability to shorten down since it has a telescopic rod, this Linerike portable fishing rod and reel combo set has enough backbone to handle anything from light fish such as panfish and small trout to big river smallmouth bass and whitefish. It is sturdy enough to handle all those types of fish but may break or snap with bigger salt-water fish or king salmon. The spinning reel is smooth to operate and works flawlessly with the 10lb rated monofilament line that I spooled it with. It can cast pretty far as long as you have some weight attached to the end of the line. The reel has worked well without a single bird or rat nest problem and no line twist. The drag on the reel is responsive a easy for beginners to operate. I did not encounter any issues while inspecting and using this fishing rod. This is a complete combo set for beginners and has mostly everything you need to get started fishing, including a carrying case and several useful lures and baits. Recommended! This is a nice fishing set. It's been awhile since I'd been mostly because it used to be a family thing/tradition. Now I'm able to go on my own. Now we all know that with fishing it's mostly a patience, timing, and waiting game as it would be called catching if you were constantly getting fish. So I haven't caught anything with this but I just might not have the luck or skill/knowledge like I used to. But this is still good! It's light weight yet well made. Comes with a bunch of things to get you started which is good for those that are new, on a budget, or it's been awhile like me. Nice complete kit to get fishing fast. He likes the rod and I like that it all packs up neatly inside the included case. This fishing rod is described as a \"beginner\" product - while it's good for beginners, to me, it's also about having a reasonable quality compact rod and reel that you can pretty much carry and use anywhere. The compact size and light weight make it perfect for those quick outings where you might not want to pack up all your normal gear.<br><br>I like the product a lot. In addition to the compact size, the case makes it convenient - I've pretty much taken to just leaving it in the back of my car so as to always have a rod handy. It just takes a moment to setup - and you're fishing. Sure, it's not a bit heavy-duty rod you'd use for deep sea fishing, but for the local pond and stuff like that, it's all you need.<br><br>Even though I have lots of much more expensive gear, I find this LineRike Fishing Rod to be handy and convenient. It's earned a spot in my arsenal for sure! A youth fishing rod that doesn’t look like it’s meant for a five-year-old!! So many of these beginner fishing rods are neon blue or pink which may be fine for really young fisherman/fisher women, but even the youngsters will love this real because it looks like an adults real! It’s well constructed, it casts beautifully, I felt the fishing reel was adequate, certainly not the best I’ve ever had but perfect for a beginner and especially a youth. The best part about it is it’s telescoping and comes in a case for easy storage and travel. I felt for the price it was a good value. This LineRike Fishing Rod and Reel Combo is not a name brand I am familiar with but for the current price of ~$36 I think it's a good value.<br><br>What I like:<br> ++Quality for the price. Telescoping rod is actually pretty good quality IMO. Telescopes smoothly and easy to setup. 2.1 meter length when fully extended (6.9 feet). Spinning reel feels good for the price as well.<br><br> ++Compact portable kit. Comes with a nice little bag. Keep this pole, reel, and accessories in your car trunk and you are ready for the unexpected when you're randomly out in BFE and see a hidden stream with the perfect trout pool.<br><br>So overall, for ~$36 this portable kit will get you or your sponsee out there in nature fishing wherever, whenever. Why not, sounds adventurous. This kit is good bang for the buck - hence 5-STAR rating by me in consideration of price/value. I bought this rod to take with us on a fishing trip and it worked out great. We had a few adults and kids so we took turns between 3 rods that we brought. This one telescopes nice, it's a lightweight rod that handles easily in the lake. It comes with everything you need: Lures, hooks, bobbles etc in a separate plastic case. Nice complete set up ready to go fishing with. Was one of the favorite among the 3 poles we brought. Highly recommend has worked well and good for the beginner. Really like how portable it is, makes it easy when going off the grid to fish. This telescopic fishing rod is very light weight, the reel is also very small but it will be good enough for recreational fishing. The max fish weight for this rod should be around 10 lbs, or I feel it will snap. I mean it is telescopic which means it retracts so its construction is not the best for heavy weight fishing so you need to set your expectation right.<br><br>As far as completeness, this is a complete set, with rod, reel, line, and hooks and baits. The reel is small but it has most the features you can find from professional reel. The supplied line and hooks are convenient and good enough for beginner and recreational uses. Overall, I am pleased with this purchase. It also came with nylon storage bag and it fits an assembled rod and reel so you don't have to take the reel off, just collapse the reel handle which is just a click of button. A lot of the time when my family and I camp we have a ton of stuff and fishing rods are very awkward to pack and take up a ton of room. So I found this and absolutely love it. My family loves it as well and all bought one to take on our camping trips. Folds up super well, and just overall so much nicer than before This will be a wonderful Christmas gift set idea for all the fishermen and women in the family. A very complete set with a well crafted rod, lures etc. Rod is fairly tough and easy to cast. Good weight and balance as well as just being darn good looking. The nice carrying case is an extra pleasant plus. I bought this for a gift. The rod has a few scratches all around the gold design and the actual pull out part has a few scuff marks. Not really impressed with the quality as I expected more since it came “wrapped up” and in a box vs. the ones on the floor at the store. I can’t speak for the performance on how it holds up just yet since it’s a gift. I really hope the recipient enjoys it and last them a good bit. This is a nice all in one package. Comes with everything you need to get started and is compact enough to fit in the kiddos backpack so they can carry it to the water. Easy setup and casts and reels well. The tackle that comes along with the package is what you need to get started. Good price point. Great for the casual fisherperson as well. Recommend. looks nice, but after about 45 minutes the reel stopped working. wouldnt close when reeled, and the spinning part was wobbly as if it came detached. so i still have the rod i guess? I was pleasantly surprised and very impressed with the value in this fishing combo. Not only does it include a telescopic rod and a decent spinning reel it also has line, lures and tackle plus a convenient carrying bag. The rod has great action for a telescopic model and the fish don’t know what hit them! All in all there seems to be great value and I am confident this kit will serve me well.\n",

            "Reviews:   The suction is strong, it picks up well on rugs and floors, it is light weight and moves around easily. This is by far the best inexpensive vac I have ever used and far outperforms more expensive ones. The extra bonus for me is how easy it is to clean the dirt chamber. Keeping that clean reduces blow back tremendously. So, unless you are looking for a HEPA vac, this is the way to go. The only downside is that it is corded vs. battery operated, but that is a small price to pay at this price point. I love how light this is. I have area rugs and it works perfect on them. Easy to empty. Long cord. The only thing this does have is an adjustment for carpet heights if that is needed. Not to mention very easy on the budget! ! I bought this for my Airbnb. At first I was super impressed because the suction power is good, and it is lightweight. My living room has a low pile rug, and it worked great here. It also works well on my hardwood However, you cannot adjust according to pile. Each of my bedrooms has a different type of rug, and I had issues here with it working well. It isn't made for higher pile rugs. Also, after a few uses, the canister lock started malfunctioning, meaning when I removed the canister to dump it, it opened and instead, all the dirt went on my feet and floor. I have a hard time relocking it. If you need something for hallways, an office or bare floors, this could work really well for you. If you have a variety of, or higher pile rugs, look elsewhere. Oh wow, how much do I love this little vacuum? I loaned my last Bissell to my daughter and then didn’t have the heart to take it back, so I bought myself this little vacuum after reading the reviews. It was less than $50 on sale and while it’s small and noisy (and the handle feels a little bit janky, although it seems to hold up okay), man, does it work!! I have had many vacuums over the years, including a fancy Dyson, and this vacuum may be my favorite in terms of suction. It also fits into those tight spaces I want to vacuum and my old vacuum didn’t fit. It’s perfect for apartment living, which is my current situation. It may look like a toy, but it works very well! Excellent vac for the price. Perfect for my studio apartment. Also, very easy to clean post vacuuming. Compact and powerful suction for its size! ! First off this isn't the sturdiest vacuum I've ever had. But it's very light, it's easy for me to use having back problems. It is more narrow but is perfect for fitting in small areas like in a bathroom. What the coolest feature is you don't have to adjust the level. You can go from Bear floor to carpet and not even have to adjust anything in the suction is amazing. You do have to stop more frequent to empty cuz everything about this vacuum is smaller and more compact. But living in a quad level it's extremely easy to just lift and carry it from one level to another with no problems whatsoever. I do however treat it a little more delicately cuz I do feel like it's kind of cheaply made. But we'll see how long it lasts you sure can't beat it for the price. I would highly recommend this whether you lived in an apartment or a large home I really feel this is going to make cleaning so much easier for me and on my back. We'll see how long it lasts but even with that said if it only lasted a few years it's still worth it. I will continue to just be gentle with it and not bump into things and not tug on it oh and one other thing it does have an extremely long cord which is very nice. Immediately after using, it was  amazing to watch the amount of dirt and pet hair this thing sucks up in the clear see through canister. It’s very light, and can be picked up with one arm. It did great with pet hair, and over an uneven slate floor. This is my new favorite vacuum. Having a double coated dog that leaves tumbleweeds of pet hair everywhere makes for a challenging clean up, but this vacuum did awesome. It’s basic, no bags to change, and only two attachments. Cord length is decent, but another couple feet would be better. I used it on hardwood, carpet, tile, and slate floors.. The suction is strong. I have a shaggy rug and this vacuum pulls the crumbs. The cord is long which I absolutely love. It’s loud but I don’t care. It does the job. Strong enough to suck up bugs too. It’s light which is a plus. This was a good buy for me I got this vacuum as a temporary solution to a more expensive vacuum that sucking up the debris functioning properly. I needed a vacuum quick and saw this Bissel and thought, “I can have it in a day or two and the price is great. So, I will just get this to clean my townhouse and then get a better replacement later.” Well, it has been over a month and I do not need a replacement vacuum as this gets the dirt, dust, hair, and anything else on my floors and carpet quite nicely.<br><br>In addition, it also works great when I am using vacuum storage bags for seasonal clothes and blankets.<br>Also, it works so well and is lightweight that I can use the detachment parts on my stairs. I had a Shark mini vac but one of the extension parts with the brush stopped working and it became useless.<br><br>The Bissel solved both of my vacuum issues at a fraction of the price. I am happy that I realized that before I bought another mini vac or more expensive vacuum and spent a few hundred dollars instead of the fifty dollars that I spent for the Bissel. I read all of the instructions before using the vacuum. It works hard but they all do in the beginning. It’s after a few months when it’s no longer brand new that you find out if it’s worth your money. I like that the dust container empties at the bottom and it’s not necessary to touch the dirt collected, just press the release button and the contents drops out. It doesn’t go underneath the bed or furniture, I had to lift the equipment to vacuum underneath. It doesn’t work well on a rubber flooring. I recommend for a small place with very little carpet, maybe just a small rug or two but not a whole place with carpet throughout and definitely with no pets. I had to empty the container twice during the first use of the vacuum. I love my new vacuum. The suction power on this thing is great! I live in an apartment that is mostly hard wood except the stairs and bedroom. I have two cats that i love so much, but they shed alot. Ive had a small vacuum previously, a very cheap one. i didnt realized how much cat hair was in my carpet until i unpacked this bad boy. this vacuum. I vacummed the bedroom at least 5 times and the amount of cat hair that came out was insane.<br><br>This is a GREAT product for a GREAT value. shoulda bought sooner.<br>This has been my favourite purchased in the last several months. Now i know im getting old lol. I just received the cleanview compact Bissel vac.<br>I have to admit that I was skeptical because of its low price, I wasn't expecting what I've found. This collection came from the area rug for the first job I did. After emptying it, I decided to go over it again and found more dug out from the same rug. Amazing thing is, this same rug was a friend if mine and I had vacuumed it with her vacuum before bringing it her with a shark vacuum thoroughly. I still am amazed at how well thus Clearview compact vacuum cleaned this rug.<br>This small vacuum did an amazing job and is perfect size for me. I'm 4ft 10 and the ease of use is great for my physical condition.<br>I haven't used the tools yet so I have nothing to share here.<br>I recommend this to all. I was leery at first that it was too light weight to be any good HOWEVER!!! I was shocked at how well it performed. Rugs that hold so much dirt were no match for its cleaning power!! I vacuumed them and then picked them up to shake them expecting all sorts of dirt and debris, but there was none left in the rugs!! The collection cup for the machine was so full!!! AMAZING, and for around $50 ! ! I love this little BISSELL. Oh snd cleaning the machine was so easy peasy. With the washable filters this thing rocks!! ! I'm pretty blown away at this things suction power! With my old cheaper vacuum, I would have to heavily rake my carpets for cat hair before vacuuming otherwise it wouldn't really do anything. I vacuumed the low pile area rug in my living room with this guy without raking, and it looked like my cat was inside the vacuum lol. So much hair i didn't even realize was there! I don't know a lot about vacuums but I would assume a vacuum like this would be over $100, at least. Very impressed! If you're looking for a drastic upgrade from your first little 30$ vacuum, this is the way to go! ! I have always liked Bissell vacuums. This vacuum is a really good vacuum. It is perfect for my small apartment. It is small and lightweight. It has powerful suction. The first time I used it I could tell my other vacuum was not picking up very much. It was easy to assemble. The instruction booklet is easy to read. The instructions are simple and easy. It is easy to take apart for cleaning. I have a cat and so a lot of cat hair and litter. This vacuum picks it all up. It is small and so it is easy to store in my laundry closet. I really like this vacuum and it was a good price. I got to this listing on Amazon whilst looking for a new inexpensive vacuum to replace my disaster of a Dyson, and saw a few reviews that rated this highly for what it is: a bargain-basement vacuum that might only work for a couple years. Held my breath, spent some money, and a few days later it arrived in a box that seemed FAR too light. After doing the rudimentary cord disentanglement and snapping the aux accessories I probably won't use into place, I picked it up. No way could this work. It was far too light.<br><br>Tried it out the next day. If I were going to have a conversation about vacuuming with the Dyson it would go something like this:<br><br>Me: Hey, the floors are disastrous. I'd really like to vacuum today.<br>Dyson: Ok, as long as Mercury isn't in retrograde and the sun is in the seventh house of Aquarius, and the moon is 2.2 degrees north of Saturn in the final quadrant of the elliptical house, and my astrology is beneficial for today, and you had a protein shake, and you didn't use your humidifier last night because I hate that ghastly thing, and your niece in North Carolina is skipping rope while you hit the power switch...maybe.<br><br>Now with this impossibly small and light Bissell:<br>Me: I want to vacuum my floors please; they're a horrible mess.<br>Bissell: I WANNA SUCK UP SOME DIRT AND LOTS OF CAT HAIRRRRR! !<br><br>One pass through my bedroom was enough to fill the poor machine but I emptied it and sallied forth. I had to use chopsticks to get the masses of hair and dirt out from around the filter so rather poor design there but I cleaned it and kept going. Ran like a champ, sucked like a champ, on both carpet and laminate floors it did great. I was pleasantly surprised and really excited to let the dust settle and run it again, and again, and again. Now I don't like in an allergic death trap (I have horrible respiratory allergies and allergy-induced asthma) quite so much anymore.<br><br>Sucks great, works great, filter could be better but if that's all I have to complain about, I'm calling this a win. Especially since I switched from my $500 Dyson POS to this little thing. I love it.<br><br>PS my Dyson story...So I had a $500 Dyson  (upright Animal Multifloor 2) for many years and maybe used it 20 times in all. Something would always go wrong. The power would cut out, it would blow out every fuse in the place, the suction was non-existent in the hose or on the floor or both. I cut everything off the roll bar, followed their tutorials for cleaning, deep cleaned the sucker...nothing worked. The hose was not blocked, the thing should have been just fine, it just wouldn't work. Three hours after I'd first called, I cut off the gentleman at Dyson who had told me my machine was out of warranty and was trying to persuade me to take it somewhere local to be fixed (so I could pay more for a vacuum for which I'd already plunked a hefty sum down) and told him I would not only never spend another penny on Dyson products, I would be doing everything I could to actively discourage everyone I knew from doing so. He was very nice and my beef isn't with him. Those freaking machines are garbage, though. I have a carpet floor and this vacuum sucks a lot of dust out easily while also getting the debris out of the carpet. The suction power on this thing is amazing and for 50$ it's a steal. It's also lightweight and small making it easy to move around. The suction tube is comfortably short due to its small size, but it can stretch out further. The nozzles provided are very helpful when getting into crevices. The tube and attachments don't fit perfectly together but if you push it in it works just fine. For 50$, yes cop this IMMEDIATELY. I have a dog that sheds ALOT - this vacuum has great suction but is very light weight and small scale so perfect for storage if you only have a small amount of closet space. The best feature is that you can take it apart and clean every aspect to the point that it looks brand new after you do that. So many times vacuums are made with parts you can't get dog hair out of, and it gets very disgusting in a short period of time. Not so with this one. Definitely recommend. Although this vacuum is smaller than an average upright there is no lack in power! I only have 3 small rugs and one wall-to-wall carpet so this mighty little vac is quite perfect. I was glad I had watched the video on its assembly and functionality which made unboxing it no challenge at all. I love the size of the canister and was awed by what that machine picked up… looks like my old upright wasn’t doing as good of a job as I thought! It handles easily and reaches under most of my furniture. I am very happy with my purchase and with the price. This sucks!! Like all the dust out of your carpets that is… This worked so much better than I thought it would for a vacuum on this price. I never realized how much stuff we had in our carpets until we used this vacuum… like seriously our old vacuum was not doing the job correctly apparently. It’s super easy to use and maintain. It has a pretty long cord. I like that it has a space for the attachments on the actual vacuum so it’s right there when you need it. Overall, seems like really rock solid vacuum at a really great price! I bought this to use at church. It's narrow enough to get between the pews. I used it this morning for the first time and I was NOT disappointed. This little vacuum really gets the job done! It's is cheaply made and I expected that when I bought it. I also expected it to do a good job and it does. The one I bought prior to this lasted about 5 years, I hope this one will hold up that long, we will see. I am happy that this one picks up on hard floors, that's a big improvement over past small vacs I've had. Considering buying another for my house. Would buy again. Will update if it doesn't hold up. I had a stick vacuum for the last year which clearly wasn’t doing the job anymore. I saw an article for this vacuum online and for the cost I couldn’t pass up getting a new one. It picked up 3x the amount my stick vacuum does. I really do believe that plug in vacuums are much more powerful and this thing doesn’t disappoint! The only down side to it is the dirt tank doesn’t seem flush against the hose elbow and I could see this as a potential issue in the future. But as a household of 1 with no pets this vacuum should last quite a while. I was pleasantly surprised at the suction on this little machine. Very lightweight, more than enough cord length, easily maneuvered, and overall good quality. My expectations were exceeded with this vacuum because it picked up more than our standard sized expensive vacuum did. I wasn’t expected the brushes on the bottom because I didn’t see or notice the bottom pictured in the photos but it ended up having very nice brushes for a small vacuum. Great buy and would buy again! So far it’s holding up nicely! I LOVE this vacuum, I bought it because my old one wasn't getting my cats hair out of my carpet. I was a bit skeptical since the price was so cheap and affordable but wow first use it made my carpet brand new again. I didnt even know I had so much hair and dust in it, the suction is AMAZING and it's so easy to use and maneuver. 10/10 for sure This Baby Bissell surprised me! I do not know how long it will last but it is starting out on a high note. I live in rural Alaska above the Arctic Circle so shipping is always a concern. Amazon Prime shipped this for free... I rent an 800 square foot apartment with about 500 square feet of short/low pile brown carpet. I did not want to put a lot of money in a vacuum because I will be leaving it when I leave here next year. The attachments are cheaply made but this is an inexpensive vacuum. The 4-star is ONLY because the longer/high pile rugs from my bathroom, gray in the photo, bogged the motor down. So, if you have a small space with short pile carpet and you are looking for an inexpensive vacuum, this Baby Bissell is a winner! I own another carpet cleaner that had great reviews. It was a Christmas gift and of course I can’t return it. The other one did not pick up. It just doesn’t work. I’m at an rv park &amp; leaves &amp; sand always get brought in. I purchased this and I love it!! And the price is under $60.00. This vacuum is perfect for my apartment and gets the job done. My only gripe is that it is very loud and I know that my neighbors can hear it whenever I run it. The size and weight of the vacuum is as described and it fits perfect in a smaller hallway closet. Even though it's compact, I wasn't prepared for the small size as I've always had much larger vacuums. I have a bad shoulder and wanted something lightweight. This fits the bill. Straight out of the box the suction is great. Hopefully it is fairly durable and I won't need a new one for a while. It didn't need any assembly which is great. The handle will need to be put into place for use. But it's designed to be removed as part of the wand system. Just click it into place, no screws or tools.<br><br>I have a 1000sf home. I did one bedroom, the kitchen and living room and the canister was full. Granted, it's been over a week since my last vacuum died and we have two shredding pets.<br><br>Like most uprights, it won't fit far underneath furniture, so you'll still need to move things when you want to get under them.<br><br>If you have a big home, you'll probably want a bigger vacuum if you dislike emptying the canister or moving the cord a lot. (The cord reached one room, so I had to move it twice.) But this one is perfect for a smaller space or if you need something truly lightweight due to physical limitations. I literally never review things but I needed to review this vacuum because of how amazing it is for the price. It is small but MIGHTY. I was excited to use it on our carpet and rugs in my apartment and oh my gosh it picked up so much dirt and dust. It was already halfway full by only vacuuming a small apartment bedroom and one living room rug. I’m so happy I got this vacuum. The perfect size for a small apartment! I did not realize how small the vacuum would be, although small it has a lot of suction power and it is perfect for my apartment at 1000 ft.<br>It works very well on linoleum as it picked up tiny dust particles, and medium size dog food Pieces. The court size is longer than I expected, which is nice not having to plug in and re-replug for different rooms. I am very satisfied with this product.. I am so happy. I have never felt more powerful with a vacuum cleaner. It is perfect for carpets and cleaning up pet hair. It is quite loud but it is totally worth it. I cleaned my apartment in 30 minutes with this thing! No need to keep vacuuming the same spot, one pass over and it’s clean. Also super easy set up. Our $200 vacuum stopped working last week and we needed another one. We were on a tight budget so I went for this one as it was only $50 with great reviews. I was still skeptical of how it would work, with powerful suction being my most needed feature. As soon as I received it, I opened it up and turned it on to use it. Assembly was very easy. The suction was more powerful than my $200 vacuum, and the amount of dust it pulled from my rug was unbelievable. I couldn’t be happier with this purchase and can’t believe I’ve ever spent more than $100 on a vacuum! This is a must have! Strong suction. Does an amazing job on both floors and rugs. Doesn't scatter dirt behind it like this model used to. I don't have stairs - but my guess is it would be a little clumsy on them. It has a detachable hose and two end fittings for corners and sofas. I have an expensive Dyson stick vacuum that just wasn't cutting it anymore, and never seemed to pick everything up so I looked around for an alternative and came across this little vacuum. The price made me a bit skeptical, but the reviews about its suction power convinced me to give it a try. And wow. I am soooooo impressed with this vacuum. After vacuuming with my Dyson, I ran over the floor again with this vacuum. And the ENTIRE canister was full of dog hair and dirt. It's small and lightweight, but wow does it have some suction power. My only gripe is that the hose is really small, so I'll have to keep my Dyson stored away for that, but I don't mind. Also, this price?! You seriously can't beat it. I am use to cordless but it's not a big deal. It arrived on time in a secure package. The driver was very careful to handle it.<br>The customer did write it's easy to put it together. However, I did not believe it. Actually, it is . It only takes a second. Thanks for making it this easy especially for seniors with arthritis.<br>I did try it immediately. It does have a very strong section. I love trash please how easy it is to open and dump it into the big trash can. I'm very pleased that my purchase is going to help innocent animals. I'm very pleased with my purchase and I shall recommend this product highly and I'm going to buy it again the need arises yes it sucks everything up but there is no height adjustment... if you have much cut pile you may want to be sure and chose a height adjustable machine. I gave it low maneuverability only because it is practically useless on carpet with any cut pile length... otherwise it moves great on bare floor and tight loop pile. They should've mentioned the lack of adjustability. I wanted an inexpensive vacuum to keep on my second floor so I don't have to drag my other one upstairs each time. This vacuum is very light weight and so far has incredible suction. It is small. I am 5'1\" and I think would be too short for most people taller than that. I had to carry it to use the attachments or I would have had to bend down. So, if you are short and not particularly strong this is a wonderful little vacuum and a great price! Overall, it is a great product with amazing suction power. It got the fine dirt out from under my floor carpets! It cleans so well! However, if you have dogs and cats or small babies that might be drawn to the vacuum like myself, please be extremely careful! Do not let them be around this vacuum at all. This thing took literally took the skin off of my babies finger. He happened to crawl up to the vacuum and it literally sucked his hand into it peeling his skin off. I think I might be missing a part on top as well. Really powerful little vacuum, basically we’ve eliminated all of our carpet except master bedroom and we have a large area rug so didn’t need a big vacuum. It exceeded our expectations as we have 2 small short haired dogs and it definitely takes care of the constant shedding. A+ even better than our clunky $1300 rainbow vacuum. This is one badass BISSELL it handles well the suction power is superior easy to assemble and worth the money I tried it when  I  received it and was shocked at the dirt it picked up on my new carpet I was IMPRESSED BISSELL is way better than Dirt Devil vacuums will never buy DIRTDEVIL VACUUMS again. BISSELL PRODUCTS ONLY FOR ME😇 They pack a whole lotta vacuum in a small machine. My last vacuum broke and money was tight so I purchased this product because it was reasonably priced and I wasn't expecting much but I ended up being pleasantly surprised. The suction is the comparable to more expensive models and the dust bin is very easy to empty. Before you spend a lot of money on another vacuum that will do literally the same job as this little machine, give this one a try. Having stairs, I was looking for a light vacuum cleaner with suction power &amp; maneuverability. It is perfect for my that and on hardwood floors and area rugs, but it won't perform the same on carpet or thick rugs. Otherwise, works perfect and it doesn't take much storage space. Easy to clean too. Thanks I LOVE this vacuum! This tiny little, super easy, super light, rockstar has suction like nothing I've ever experienced in a vacuum. Seriously - it goes from shag carpet in the bedroom to tile floor in the kitchen with zero cares in the world. I can't believe what it got after one pass through, and I clean super often. The only negative thing I can say is that the suction is too powerful for my throw rugs, but I have no problem shaking those out by hand to have this awesome machine. All this for less than $50? Crazy! This is the little machine that could. Very lightweight, easy to handle and picks up dog hair better than my Dyson on high and low rugs and tile floors. No frills - no height adjustment tab or retractable cord but the suction strength makes up for that and it's perfect for my needs. It's basically all plastic and as long as I'm careful not to bump it into walls and furniture too hard I'll be happy if it lasts 5 years for the price I paid for it. Recommend if you don't go too hard on your vaccuums! While it is small, it has a lot of power! The attachment hose is ridiculously short, but the vacuum was light enough to pick it up and still use the attachment. Have used only once, but so far I think it’s worth the $50. This is a great vacuum for the price. Bought it for my son in the event he will vacuum his new apartment. I like that it is light weight, easy to maneuver, and stores away in small area of closet. I had seen reviews and videos of this cleaner and as always, taken them with a pinch of salt but this little thing really delivers.<br>It has removed more dirt,hair and dust in one pass than my old one would do in a year and brushes up the carpet pile as well.I wasn't expecting this sort of power so I'm pleasantly surprised.<br>The only drawbacks,which I wouldn't penalise on the star rating as they are mentioned before, are the short hose and the noise.<br>It does make quite a racket but all that power gives the feeling that it's really getting down to business so it's not that bothersome.I quite like hearing the dirt  hit the collector.<br>As for thr short accessory tube,it's OK for most jobs and the machine is light enough to pick up and move but wouls be nice if they offered an extension.The handle tube works but a flex tube would be better.<br>All in all, a nice bit of kit. She just arrived today and I was very excited since I just ordered to days ago. It's the perfect size for my 2 bdrm apartment. Pretty light weight but powerful. I went over a carpet that I thought was pretty clean and it pulled up way more than I anticipated. I am very pleases with this purchase and the price was definitely a plus! My 2nd to last vacuum was this exact model. I was happy with it. It lasted five years, of course by the end it was beat up, but suction fine. I bought a cheap stick type vacuum, thinking it would be ok. Bad mistake. So I bought another one of these Bissells. What a difference. Picked all the stuff the stick left behind. Happy again. I am pleased with this purchase it suction in great the only down side the hose is too short but for this price it is worth the trade. I love this vacuum. It took two seconds to put together when I got it out of the box. It’s small but mighty. Plus it’s perfect for a small apartment. It takes up very little space and it’s lightweight. I bought it to use on my porches so I don't mix inside and outside dirt. I didnt expect much but...Little did I know that its one level of suction is strong enough to get dog hair out of my inside carpet and it worked very well vacuuming my kitchen floor! Small, light, easy to clean...I'm very impressed and very glad I bought it! I love this Baby Bissell! ! This is a good cheap vacuum, but it's a little powerful. I accidentally let this run and sit over it's power chord and it ate the rubber off of it. Thankfully I have electrical tape and covered it and it still works. But that was terrifying not noticing it until I grabbed the chord right where it was missing rubber one day while cleaning. I did not get shocked at all.<br><br>Also ate rubber off of my bike mat? So just be careful cleaning and turn it off if you are going to let it sit for a second. Don't let it rest on something that isn't carpet. I just purchased this Bissell compact vacuum to replace an inefficient dirt devil vacuum. This vacuum makes vacuuming so much easier and picks up hair, lint, dust and dirt not  visible to the eye. It does an amazing job and cuts the vacuuming time down due to its incredible sucking power. I was simply amazed at its cleaning ability and how much the clean view canister collected. It was easy to assemble and comes with a decent size cord far longer than most former vacuums I have had. This vacuum has made vacuuming rugs and floors so much easier and less time consuming. It has a weighted bottom for stability and sturdiness. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the quick shipping so I could see for myself how wonderful this vacuum is and works. The suction power is crazy!!! It’s so strong that I had to forcefully push the vacuum across the rug. The debris it picked up was from carpet deodorizer I sprinkled on the carpet months ago. I had been using a Bissell featherweight vacuum that didn’t work well, which is why I started searching for something else. This is great quality for the price! I would definitely get it! Be blessed! Always put God first! This little vacuum has saved me I am 76 and was getting so I could not push my other big vac . So I ordered this life and sanity saving vacuum not only is it easy to use but has better suction than any other vac I have had. So bissell thank for making this old gals life easier and want to tell everyone I know what a great gift this has been to my life . But there are a few differences between the apartment size and a full size.It does okay but you can tell it has less power.The cord won’t stay in the holder on the handle.You have to vacuum slower so it will pick up everything.This is a temporary solution,then I will buy a bigger Bissell. These are cheap but REALLY good vacs. Ive used them the last 2-3 years and they KICK ASS!<br><br>Dont be intimidated by its size. it works super well. But they last about a year on average but i mean for the price how can you complain.<br><br>Love these vacs. Definitely buying another one next year! It's been just under a year and the vac keeps getting clogged. It doesn't pick up well after unclogging. Not worth it unless you plan to buy a new vac every year.<br>I called Bissell and they 100% stand behind their manufacturer warranty. A new vac was at my house the next day. Excellent customer service. i was looking for a new vacuum for my apartment after my $250 dollar vacuum kicked the bucket , all i have to say is this 60 dollar vacuum blows away my old $250 dollar one , impressive for the price , the suction is very high sometimes it fights you to push it , but the amount of stuff i vacuumed up with this vacuum was insane , my old vacuum couldnt do what this new one does , if you live in an apartment like my self this vacuum is ideal , i am pleasantly surprised by it , cant beat it for the price Let's give it a few more time of use. However, this seems to have a hood suction power. It's very easy to assemble that you don't even need tools. It doesn't habe a retractable cord, but it does the job, if you have only few places to vacuum around Not so great on thick carpet as it will pull the fibers out. It does a great job on flat carpet and floors. Do wish the vacuum itself was a little taller. Very nice vacuum, it was very easy to setup, it took less than five minutes.<br>The removable extension wand works great also.<br>For the price, you get a BISSELL vacuum; this is the best deal on Amazon.<br><br>I Give This Product A Five Stars. This little vacuum is smaller than a regular upright vacuum. We use it in our travel trailer and it works amazingly well. We are able to store it in a storage closet with a ladder, broom, and portable air conditioner. The handle detaches so it can be small. It has good suction and picks up the dirt and grass from the rug. Just the right size for my camper and suction is very strong. I love it! The way the hose extends with the handle is great for reaching hard to reach places. needed an upgrade from my old vacuum. i could tell our old one wasn’t working that good so we finally decided to get this product and omg i love it. we have 3 pets and after vacuuming our room and living room, the vacuum picked up SO much. our room feels cleaner! also, i love it’s size. it’s PERFECT for anyone with a small living space or apartment. it’s not that big and it’s not that small. it’s just the right size and it’s super light. personally, i love that because our old vacuum was super heavy for me and i would immediately get tired after trying to vacuum. i used this one and im not even tired at all. 5 stars ⭐️ I will provide photos later to show how much this sucks up daily on the carpet here- I live in a place where the people before my roommate and I had barely cleaned after themselves and had a few ats.<br>To the eye, it seemed that after the first time I used it I was all done but nope- Each day the carpet feels softer and softer because it just keeps sucking up dust, dirt and dander that has settled from the previous tenant. That sucks because clearly they did not properly cleanse and vacuum like they said and just slapped \"move-in ready\" on the title to get someone to move in but it is what it is.<br><br>Just recently got it of course so no issues- a little wide for stairs and I WILL purchase if there is a version with THIS amount of power + a longer hose pleeeeaseee. Thats the only thing I would want to improve at this point honestly.<br><br>It is loud but not louder than what I would expect from a vacuum that works properly- i dont mind that at all and it gets the job done. This is powerful, easy to maneuver. It gets under beds, coffee tables etc. The only slight downside to it is -it needs emptying often. It usually needs emptying after each 12x16 room. Otherwise it’s great! The attachment for getting drapes, window sills, etc is awesome! The vacuum is slim and powerful. It was easy to put together and rubs perfectly. It is a little loud, but it does it's job. I would recommend this product to others. This vacuum is a little smaller than I anticipated but it’s incredibly lightweight, powerful suction, and easy to assemble.<br><br>Cons - i don’t like where the cord gets wrapped up when not in use. Its a little weird trying to wrap it . Also wish the cord was a little longer. Lightweight and good suction. Not a heavy duty vacuum, but perfect for routine cleaning. I had a small vacuum cleaner before this and after cleaning every week from that I got this much dirt from carpet. This is very handy and powerful My other vacuum just like this one gave out after a year running smoothly...Probably an easy fix but I just ended up getting a new one. Love it! Small but mighty. Definitely worth the price. Has really good suction and does a great job considering how small it is. Not unhappy with this vacuum at all This vacuum is a very basic piece for. a small space - - apts or dorm rooms. It is compact and easy to assemble. The pieces click in place, no problem. The vacuum is lightweight and the pieces are not really robust (be aware) but it does the job. The suction is GREAT - - picked up everything without fail. Easy to empty and clean. I also used the attachment to extend the reach of the unit and lost no suction power in the process. This vacuum was very economical for the budget and I. would recommend it to interested parties. I needed a light easy to use one to carry up my stairs and do 2 bedrooms this inexpensive one worked great. The heavy one stays downstairs now. I'm amazed at the amount of dirt that it picked up the first time I used it. More power and easier use than my last vacume Estoy encanta con ella ya que me ayudó mucho con la limpieza de mi apartamento tanto para piso como para la alfombra, 100% recomendado 👌 I tried it &amp; I liked it! Not a \"too much of a hassle vacuum\"! I'm a simply kind of girl; give me simple! 😄😊 This is a smaller (narrower) vacuum that works excellently. I'd agree that this vacuum is better suited to smaller rooms. There Is a lot of cleaning power. Love! I live in a small studio apartment and is the perfect size and lightweight. Great suction, does the job! Very happy with my purchase. Bissell is a very good product but I was disappointed it doesn’t have a carpet height adjuster. It’s also pretty loud; but a very good vacuum overall. Sucks up a lot of dust and hair on the wood/laminar floors.<br>I use it on rugs too and it's pretty decent as well. ? It works ok just really small Light weight does the job<br>Price Got tired of lugging my heavy, clumsy, inefficient vacuum around the house. This Bissel vac is so easy to maneuver and really has fantastic suction. Am very glad I bought it I received this vacuum today and it was much smaller than expected. The handle snaps in and it is plastic which feels a bit flimsy so we will see how it holds up in time BUT it has great suction. It has a short hose but the handle comes off and can be attached to the hose. I don't need a long hose so it wasn't a concern to me. I vacuumed yesterday and so I thought I'd vacuum again to see the difference in ability and I picked up WAY too much dirt off of a \"clean\" floor with this new vacuum. I also love that the company donates to pets. So far I'm very pleased with my purchase and I would buy it again. Completely surprised by this little vacuum. Lightweight but works like a much bigger and expensive vacuum. Shocked at the fabulous value. The suction is amazing, easy to empty, easy to maneuver, has 2 basic attachments. Excellent vacuum and value. Needed to replace our failing vacuum that was heavy and bulky. This vacuum is great! Easy to assemble, simply place handle on the device, super lightweight and alot of suction power. It is the best vacuum I have had. I got the cheapest vacuum (red) and it is awesome! Picks up dog hair well on carpet and love the hose attached. Very easy to assemble, lightweight and does have incredible suction for a smaller vacuum cleaner. Also has a long cord length. Becareful when you empty dirt bin.. the latch easily comes undone..<br>Everything spills out..<br>Just tape it shut.. before you begin<br><br>Other wise .. a perfect buy This is lightweight vacuum cleaner to go up and down the stairs. Even though it is small, it works great. For the price this little vacuum dose pretty good in vacuuming up dog hair 😀 im surprised. It's very light wt, small, easy to use, the look is a little flimsy, but hey, it does the job. I just can't afford anything else. For tightly woven carpets, this vacuum is very powerful. If you have fluffy carpets and rugs this vacuum will each out patches in them making significant bald spots. Thank goodness my carpet is very tightly woven, but not such for my bathroom rugs. It ate up patches of fibers  in all of them. PLEASE DO NOT change the the power of the suction as this is one of the best vacuums I have purchased in very long time that have such powerful suction, but I would really caution consumers to not use on loosely woven, fluffy, mohair, etc. type carpets as it will destroy it. I'm glad I listened to the reviews with this purchase because this vacuum has impressed me. The suction is so strong and surprising considering the height of the vacuum. It's lightweight, but sucks up strong. I used my prior vacuum the day before using this one and the amount of lent and stuff that came up with the new vacuum is eye-opening. Definitely recommend! This is a great little vacuum - the suction is good, picks up a lot, light and easy to use. I wanted a vacuum that would easily pick up pet hair and it does that. Really small so it goes to max after a room or two. Also small cord, you'll have to unplug and plug often. Easy to dump out dust/dirt. We just needed something small so this works amazing for us. I love this vacuum. It sucked up cat hair and dirt that I did not even see. My only grip is, it’s a little hard to push on my shag rug. But the rest of the house, it is prefect. I recommend this vacuum and I would buy it again. The price is right and it gets the job done in a flash. I'm used to high quality vacuums and although this is not high quality it is well priced and definitely has some power to it. I don't see it lasting a significant amount of time but I think it'll last long enough to get it my money's worth out of it.\n",

            "Reviews:   Picture is clear and battery great. No issues with connectivity and it’s picking up motion, person, and bell perfectly. Extremely easy to set up in the App and navigate settings etc. For mounting, As a renter, I purchased the door mount and it looks and works great! Super secure! I’ve been using the Ring doorbell for a month now and although I selected outside the recommended settings for recording length (1 minute vs. 30 seconds), i still have 73% battery life. Only 27% used in 30 days. At this rate, i expect my battery will last another 3 months before i need to charge. However, when i do, I also went ahead and bought an extra battery pack as not to lose any monitoring time. Also bought a yard sign  Very pleased with all my Ring purchases thus far and would highly recommend! Overall great value! I am thoroughly impressed with the Ring Doorbell! Installation was a breeze, thanks to the straightforward instructions and included tools. The video quality is excellent, providing clear and sharp footage day or night. I love how I can see and speak to visitors from anywhere using the Ring app on my phone, which adds a significant layer of security and convenience. The motion detection alerts are timely and customizable, ensuring I never miss a visitor or package delivery. Overall, the Ring Doorbell has exceeded my expectations and provided peace of mind. Highly recommend! I wired into the existing doorbell wiring, no need to change batteries all of the time. Works well, good visibility including at night. Will be adding more cameras to pick up what this does not. I appreciate that the squirrels and other animals do not trigger. I appreciate being able to hide notifications from neighbors that I am not interested in, for example, everyone’s missing cats that they let roam freely. I am really impressed with this doorbell from Ring. The quality of the video and the coverage of the camera is remarkable. The batteries seem long lasting. I was a bit worried about the battery life, but it is great. I've had it fir more than 2 weeks and the battery indicator is still almost at full charge. You can also talk to anyone at your door, with no need to open the door. I purchased the chime and it does a great job alerting me to anyone approaching my door. It can also be set to disregard passing cats! It was easy to put up and easy to link to the internet. It is good and works well. We live in an area with poor WiFi reception so it is hard for me to give it a 5 star because the sensor is not accurate. At times it goes off when people walk on the sidewalk but will not always work when someone comes to the front door. It seems that if the delivery person comes in from the side and leaves a package on the front steps the Ring system does not recognize the motion. With that said, we do like the camara feature when we are not home. Overall we are happy with the purchase. I love this product the camera is so clear the quality is amazing! I had no problem connecting it to wifi. It’s affordable I like how I can get notifications right away when someone walks by or ring the bell! The quality of the camera at night is what I liked as well U have full body view, very HD nite and day, and works well with the custom zone that u set. I had the original Ring doorbell and the clarity of the Ring Doorbell Plus is remarkably better both daytime and night. Easy install and being able to remove the battery to charge it is much easier than earlier models I finally decided to try the ever-popular Ring doorbell. I can only assume that the hype is from being an early entry into this space because after using a myriad of home automation products, I have not been impressed by this Ring doorbell in the slightest.<br><br>-----------------------<br>1. Terrible documentation<br><br>The box contains a tiny leaflet with no information about installing the thing, just info on expediting your personal information into their system. The only hardware reference is a picture of the hardware included, with no part counts to verify that you got what you were supposed to or descriptions to explain what the fasteners in each of the four paper envelopes should be used for. Zero info for actually using the mounting hardware. There is additional info in the setup process in the mobile app; not good info and super annoying to pick details out but technically there. This is apparently not a product for grown-ups who learned to read actual words.<br><br>2. Bad hardware.<br><br>The package only contains two machine screws to connect to doorbell to the mounting plate. It's bad enough that the unit only has four holes for attaching to the mounting plate, leaving a gap at the top since no fasteners are used to hold the top half of the unit. It's far worse when one of the two middle holes gets stripped, leaving a razor-thin margin between mostly attached and dangling even if there was a third screw to add to the fun.<br><br>By the way, when I say \"envelope, I mean there are four tiny envelopes labeled A through D for the hardware. Not sealed envelopes, just folded over and tucked, so maybe there was supposed to be more in here but they fell out while being packed, since some fasteners fell out when I removed the envelopes from the box but before I untucked any flaps. No indication on the envelopes as to what each should be used for, just a letter, so you'll just have to figure it out based upon clues from whatever sources that you can find and any prior experience that you have with similar parts.<br><br>The screws are metal, the mounting plate is plastic, and the threads are tiny. Mounting the doorbell to the mounting plate securely is a very delicate balancing between having a secure hold and stripping the threads, even when fingertipping the little Torx driver that they include. I barely got resistance on one before it began spinning freely, leading to the aforementioned stripping; one of only four mounting holes now useless. By very, very slowly turning the screws in two of the remaining holes, I was able to get them to hold without stripping. They seem tight enough but I don't dare snug them down any more.<br><br>The mounting plate is angled to left or right depending on how it gets placed, but all documentation and video I found online, given complete lack of included docs, are either for flat plates or an add-on plate that angles vertically rather than horizontally. Fortunately not difficult to figure out but I spent far more time than necessary trying to figure out if it was supposed to be that way or if they screwed up what went into the box. I'm still not sure since the hardware picture only covers the fasteners but the plate works so letting it be.<br><br>The heads on the screws for the concrete anchors are about the same size as the mounting plate slot, so screws slide right through the slots when tightened, leaving the plate behind. No washers provided so it's just the screw head to hold. I drilled holes in the mount next to the slots so that the tiny heads on the screws would have something to hold after every screw popped right through the slot while hand-tightening. Note that the drywall anchor screw heads are larger so all of the people mounting doorbells to drywall for some reason should get a decent hold at least.<br><br>3. Insecure.<br><br>Physically, this thing is trivial to pull from the wall and take, although I don't expect most people would since the devices do get registered. But if someone decided that it would be funny to rip the device off of the wall and throw it into the street, that would kill 3-4 seconds of their day and $150 of your wallet. The battery takes about two seconds to remove; there is a small screw hole to secure it, although no screw included unless you're expected to use one of the battery and only one to hold the unit to the mounting plate. So by default, they make for a very easy way for the unscrupulous to get extra batteries for their own doorbell.<br><br>As far as software, it really goes out of it's way to farm out your personal information. Before you can even get to useful technical info, they're prompting for personal details to shove into their servers and inevitably leak out to the world, at least whatever info they aren't simply selling. And you have to expose some personal info just to get basic functionality since using the doorbell attached to your house and viewing the video through that camera on your house requires going through Ring via the Internet unless you pony up a lot more money.<br><br>There is no local storage. To get a simulation of local storage, you have to buy a completely different piece of hardware AND subscribe to an additional service. Keeping with the theme of the Ring app being more of a marketing tool than a tool to help manage your home.<br><br>They push a feature called Neighbors that tries to get you to expose more info to the people with the easiest access to your home under the guise of improving security. Admittedly, Ring is probably more concerned with targeting people in secured enclaves who don't actually need any sort of extra security but want something to deal with people at the door. But it does get marketed to everyone so something to be very aware of for the rest of the human race.<br><br>If you think that calling the app a marketing tool is an exaggeration, the main app page has an ad for another Ring product that takes up more space than the preview of the last pic taken by the camera and the managing icons above that preview. Above that, the top bar of the screen exists just to push the Neighbors function.<br><br>-----------------------<br><br>Not to say that it's all bad. The camera view doesn't reach the ground in front of the doorbell so not great for spotting packages stuck in front of the door, but image quality is solid otherwise. I'd say that the image quality is comparable to my ~$25 Wyze cameras. The rechargeable batteries are handy to manage with built-in micro-USB ports and quick-release buttons for quick swaps.<br><br>If the unit was available standalone and had an alternative to using it other than by feeding yet another avenue for identity theft then I could see them being a very handy part of a home automation setup. But it isn't standalone and does require farming out your info just to get very basic functionality.<br><br>In conclusion, I'd only recommend the Ring doorbell to someone whom I wanted to severely annoy and potentially rob, unless they were sufficiently handy and tech saavy to secure it despite the best efforts of Ring, in which case I'd just tell them to spend less money on something better. It's a shame because the basic doorbell/camera unit seems pretty good but everything around it is trash. we recently bought a Ring doorbell based on a recommendation from our son. (we ended up with a battery doorbell plus which we're happy with but that's not how things started out)<br><br>We first bought a wired one because we already have a transformer, wires and an antique doorbell with 4 foot chimes that we wanted to maintain.<br><br>However, the first one stopped working after a day and amazon support told us to exchange it that it was defective. Second one did exactly the same thing. I measured the voltage and it was 19.5v which is within the parameters of the device but - as the wiring in the house is over 75 years old, I'm thinking possibly the transformer or wiring is bad and either periodically shorting or developing spikes and ruining the device.<br><br>When it stops working, it cannot be reset. Even the factory reset fails.<br><br>I exchanged it for a battery unit (we had to buy an amazon chime as well) and it's worked perfectly for the last week so we're very happy.<br><br>It's too bad they don't make a wifi mechanical device that can trigger our existing antique chime.<br><br>We're probably going to add some other security features like cameras, lights, sensors too.<br><br>one thing to note is that the camera lens on the plus is much wider than the one on the wired doorbell plus which couldn't even see the porch unless we angled it downward. That may be a plus for identifying people if you can get it aimed properly.<br><br>One negative, it will register someone at the door if they are walking by our house... First review is below. This is my amended review after speaking with Ring customer support.<br>Our doorbell is working better than ever, thanks to Ring customer support. Very helpful. Walked me thru some steps I wasn't aware of concerning settings. Also learned that part of the reason our doorbell wasn't picking up motion is because of where I have it mounted. These doorbells work better when they are at around 4 ft from the ground. Mine is over 6 ft due to a set of steps leading up to our back door. Settings were adjusted and I have ordered a wedge to go behind the doorbell. Ring customer support really came thru. We will be purchasing more Ring devices. Thanks Ring!!! !<br><br>(Our Ring doorbell has begun to operate on a \"now or then\" basis. Some days I get a notification when there is motion at the doorbell, someday I don't. The doorbell is located less than 10 ft from our wifi router, so signal strength isn't an issue. We have other wifi cameras 5x the distance from the router, and they work fine. Today, someone went to our back door and took something... the Ring doorbell never activated, recorded, notified... but the wifi camera 50ft away picked up motion. I will not recommend Ring to anyone.) Installed directly on my front door which faces away from the street so it does not really get triggered by people walking on the sidewalk. I set the motion and package sensitivity to the highest setting, turned on HDR, color night vision, auto recording length, and snapshot every 5 minutes. Motion zone is for people and packages only, with other motion turned off. It is also close to my router so the wifi signal is very strong. So far, the battery is still at 35% after two months.<br><br>WHAT I LIKE:<br>-Battery can be replaced so you can put in new battery while charging the other.<br>-Clear head to toe capture of person. (My doorbell is in a well lit area at night so the infrared only works during a power outage. )<br><br>WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:<br>-No alarm.<br>-Motion warning is disabled. I guess they only allow that feature on “select wired and plug-in doorbells and cams.”<br>-There is about a half-second lag in the speaker and microphone.<br>-Motion detection is a bit slow and often captures people when they are almost at my front door. So if someone is moving really fast, you only capture them as they are leaving the area. I suppose I could turn on “other motion” but I don’t want it to be triggered by animals or moving plants/trees.<br><br>Overall, I am happy with this purchase. bought these a long time ago while in Atlanta to make sure I could see who was at my door before I opened it. Worked great then and still does now that I have my own home here in Charleston. btw the mounting bracket does deteriorate over time lol. I've had the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus for a month as of 5/6/2024.<br><br>So, this is my \"initial\" review of my experience using the product. I shall write another review after I have the product a while longer.<br><br>I gave the product an overall score of four (4) stars because the resolution for night vision is poor and because of the minor problem with Wi-Fi connection. Even with the area illuminated (porch light on) at night, it is difficult to clearly see an object or a person. I gave the Wi-Fi signal four (4) stars because I had to \"reconnect\" the Ring camera to my Wi-Fi from time-to-time. It would lose signal to the internet often. So far, aside from poor night vision and problem with Wi-Fi connection, the quality of the product appears to be \"comparable\" to other security cameras in the category of doorbell security cameras that use a battery. It's very laggy but may be my cox internet. I very much appreciate this product. Battery charge is quick. Charge lasts about 2 weeks I think. I really like that I can see what's going on and get notified while away from home even 2 hours away. I also enjoy the neighbors feature with otherd nearby communicate with missing and found pets and crime notifications others post. A bit more expensive than previous versions but I sweep that into the inflation category. Overall I would recommend. This is a great addition to my front door. Now not having to run to the front door to see a sales person or someone I wanted to my home. Also does keep an eye on my cars and out front yard with alerts. And also be able to look back on anything that I might have missed on that day if I was away from home all day. I received and installed this unit in early December, 2023. I decided to wait until the battery needed to be charged before writing a review. Today is April 10, 2024 and the unit is still working and I've not had to charge it. To me, that's GREAT BATTERY LIFE! I usually have about 6 to 10 motion notifications a day. (I cause most of those myself). My unit is mounted on the front of my garage and it functions as a security camera rather than as a doorbell.<br><br>I didn't take the monthly plan and therefore, I only get a message that there's motion detected at the doorbell. However, if I immediately check the doorbell history there will be a photo of what caused the motion. Occasionally, I see the neighbor's cat crossing in front of my garage about 15 feet out. It picks me up in front of my truck about 20 to 21 feet away. Now and then, a deer rounds the corner of my garage, and it picks it up too. It doesn't hold the images very long but you can see what's there if you look right away. I don't have any trouble identifying what's out there. Since I don't pay the monthly fee, for me that's not too bad!<br><br>The doorbell unit is located more than 110 feet from my computer system and cell phone inside my home. The signal seems to me to be very good. My garage is well-lighted and is bright in the front, so I can't say how good the unit is with night vision.<br><br>Maybe I will update this message when the battery runs down. Update:  June 19, 2024:  The battery charge indicator showed it was almost completely discharged. The unit has been working flawlessly. I removed the battery and charged it today. Hope this helps. Love having the ring, because we have a vet long drive, and can see who's coming before they even get to the door! We don't have a doorbell so this talking feature makes it nice ecen if you're not home! I highly recommend it. Good quality image and detection. It makes us feel safe, and the battery lasts well. The app connects us with the neighbors and alerts us of bad weather conditions and more. I like knowing who is at the door without looking out the window and be seen. Also today when I wasn’t home, I saw the Amazon driver just throw the package on my porch. Didn’t even go on the porch. Video quality pretty good but battery is terrible. Fully charged battery on receipt and and again after pipe work in front of house. 2 weeks later it says battery is dead. Recharged it overnight. Again it says battery is dead. Pulled battery to recharge but only the green light comes on saying it's charged. Called customer service and she had me change 1 setting (video length to 20 sec from 30 sec) to reduce battery usage (other settings were already good) and change the motion zone slightly. Then told me to charge the fully charged battery.<br><br>Edit: after posting my review I was contacted by Ring. Brett went through several actions with me. Eventually it was determined that the device was bad and a replacement was shipped to me. A bit of a hassle trying to send the original back but finally able to send it back. I bought this Ring camera for my front door. I live in an apartment complex that has security cameras, but only on the front side of all the buildings, which is....well whatever. We have a package thief. Plus, since our apartment is on the back (no cameras) side of the building, it just doesn't feel safe to come in and out alone sometimes, especially at night. Our apartment is upstairs, but our private entry is downstairs. Anywho, so far, so good with the camera. The app was easy to install and I didn't have any issues with setup. I've gone through all of the categories in the settings and everything is pretty self-explanatory and easy to understand. I have it set to send me a notification on my phone and on my Echo Show when there is a person at the door. I already have a doorbell, so I'm not using that feature. My favorite part so far is my kids' reactions lol I have a 10 year old and a 16 year old and when they each got home from school yesterday, it was cute watching them make faces at the camera. I have a feeling it'll be a daily thing for awhile lol The other thing I love is the \"live\" feature. When my oldest got home, he'd forgotten his key, so I was able to talk to him from inside our apartment and let him know it was unlocked. I have a feeling that this will be one of my favorite features because I've just had ankle surgery recently, so getting up and down the stairs is a hassle. This will make it easier to \"answer the door\" without actually having to hop on one foot all the way down and back up. I'll update if I come across anything else I find helpful or any issues I might have. it is a good item, but directions were a little confusing and after going over them several times, I decided not to even try installing it, and that was the reason I returned it instead of opening it and playing with it. I suggest anyone buying this have some kind of knowledge of how to install an electronic doorbell of this type. ! Motion detector is not delayed night vision is good  the hdr is clear kind of like 2K sound quality is great mounting is sticker or no sticker lighting is good too 10/10 I've had a battery Ring for a few years now and decided to add another covering my back door/garage. These work well once you get them set up the way you want. I keep extra battery packs charged up and ready to change when needed so I don't lose coverage. I also have a Chime ringer indoors to let my dogs know if anything is detected so they don't have to stare out the windows all day. I purchased this to replace an older model Ring Doorbell that required me to remove the entire device to charge it. I’m loving the ability to quick release and charge only te battery pack. Free pro tip: I purchased the battery packs and charger so I always have a fully charged battery ready to switch out when the one in the doorbell needs to be charged. This upgrade has already saved me a lot of time and effort. I highly recommend Ring Doorbell and all Ring products, especially the battery operated devices for outdoors if you live somewhere that you cannot hard wire your devices.<br><br>I was able to easily remove the previous device I had mounted with super strength outdoor double sided mounting tape (a little extra elbow grease and a scraper to remove the residual tape) and mount this new device with the mount that is made for wireless mounting (the first Gen doorbell and mount  I had wasn’t designed to be mounted with tape but I made it work for my purposes and I was elated that Ring now has a mount specifically designed for the exact purpose I needed! )<br><br>I can’t recommend Ring products enough. They are reliable, easy to use, have great customer service, and are very durable. I purchase a plan from Ring to be able to store all of the recordings from my different devices and I absolutely love the Ring app for managing the devices all in one place. I’m aware there are many different products available now, and some are cheaper, but Ring works and you get what you pay for! 5 stars from a loyal multi-Ring doorbell and cam owner! We live out in the country, and I work from home. I feel so much safer working from home now that we have this. I love that I get notified as soon as it detects motion. 1. The doorbell works fine, as a doorbell that sounds over my various alexa enabled devices. Very good since I have them around the house and wherever we are we know when the doorbell is pressed.<br><br>2. The battery has to be recharged every few weeks. I had hoped for a couple of months.<br><br>3,. The big disappointments were the captured videos and the movement detection. The device comes with a one month subscription to an Amazon security service. So, for the first month, the movement detection worked fine as did the video capture function. Once the subscription was over, movement detection became unreliable, and leaves and birds and cars on the street 5 feet away. Similarly, without the subscription, the system does not capture videos. IT will only show live video. So, if a bell push or movement causes an alert to you, and you are delayed getting to your video screen, and the person has going away, you have no way of knowing who had been at the door or if the alert was due to a moving leaf.<br><br>There is no good reason for the lack of video capture, since most people have a computer than can act as a server. It would seem that the feature is not made available because Amazon wants to capture monthly and annual subscriptions<br><br>The problem with motion detection is at caused by the fact that, when the you do not subscribe, Amazon no longer gives you access to an intelligent recognition feature. The problem is compounded because the doorbell camera cannot be adjusted as to whee it is aimed.<br><br>I already had a camera on my front door and it gives an excellent picture and intelligent alert and it stores all videos on my system. So I use the Ring doorbell as a doorbell only, and I turned off the video and movement feature.<br><br>Uless you are happy to buy a subscription, I do not recommend this doorbell camera. If you have 5g network, be sure to get the 2024 ring. Love my ring doorbells. My daughter has been using this product for 21 days now and the battery life is still at 60%! She installed it herself and it works very well. She has not encountered any problems with it. My new door bell hadn’t lived up to its full potential yet. Still exploring. Moving from (free Arlo) to paid Ring. The camera is updated and high quality. I've went through 2 of these already. Both lasted a month a piece and then shot the 💩. Come on Amazon do better.<br>Edit: I did manage to get the 2nd one back up and running again. It sometimes fails to shoot a live video but if you are controlling the doorbell from an Android phone I found if you turn WI-FI on you phone off, it will shoot live video again through the mobile network. I chose the most recent edition 2023, why compare the older one, I had a 2020 one, the new edition's battery ran out so fast, maybe 2 weeks need to replace, I ordered another two battery to prepare for the replacement. A little disappoitment. I love the camera, it captures a lot and has a wide side to side view. I can see all the way to the street but there is a few seconds delay before it capturs video. Battery charge lasted more than 3 months. I bought an extra battery, swapped it out easy, sound is good, no connection issues, I think it was whorth the purchase. It comes with the Chime and sync’s perfectly. Excellent purchase! ! A most for security. In this dam age security its a most and this does it well ... You would think after so many years they would be able to make a ring doorbell camera that is high definition. Not just up close, but that is able to read license plates and make out faces that pull up in front of your home. Easy and good quality in the camera we have 6 ring door bells for our homes🩷 The installation took some time, primarily because I had to drill into a block wall to mount it, plus I needed it to work with my existing mechanical chime. There's a bit of a learning curve to really understand exactly how everything works, but the final result is beyond impressive. After 30 days, you have to subscribe to a Ring protection plan to keep all the advanced recording and storage features going, but they're pretty cheap. I got the intermediate plan for $10 a month. In short, I totally love this thing. I have good number of cameras,  doorbells, and alexa devices all configured and paired together. I bought this doorbell to upgrade my front door. Wow is it nice!! I really can see the difference in verticle resolution.<br><br>These have a lot of great options and features that really give you good control over your devices with a few major cons that really are hard to overlook and should cost a few stars.<br><br>Pros. Great alerts,  great video quality for just 1080p,  range, and night vision. I can have it setup so if my front door gets motion alert, all the flood lights and cameras that can see that area light up and record. You can share with family members and determine what cameras they can see and which they cannot. I.E. we have a bedroom cam for our rottweiler puppy that has a large crate we can see right into during these early training months. I'd rather not having my teenage kids seeing into my bedroom but them getting motion alerts for the doors is awesome.<br><br>Cons. Local storage is blocked behind a paywall. I literally bought a 512gb microsd card and found out when I couldn't find where to enable that you have to not just pay more than what I was before with one camera,  but you have to move up to their most expensive 20 dollar a month plan!!! What... The...heck Ring!??! I'm reading also that even after you do this,  you can't use both cloud AND local storage.. This is double dumb and downright either HORRENDOUS design by the developers or just intentional extortion via nickel and diming of their already paying customers.<br><br>I'm a 25+ year IT professional. In EVERY camera system or data suite you care about,  local and cloud storage together IS the bee's knees. It should be available on cloud no matter what in case of fire/ring alarm theft and local storage used for faster replaying of recent events up to the amount of data your SD card can hold.<br><br>Rather than giving in and paying,  I returned the SD card and said screw it. I previously was paying about 3.99 a month for my single ring camera. I got tired of maintaining my local IP camera setup and needing a vm (virtual machine) running to record and eating up storage on my NAS to save it all. I was stoked when I saw the local storage. I dropped over 500 bucks on doorbell cams for back and side doors,  flood light cams,  and interior cameras to ensure our pets left home are fine and being checked on when we go on longer trips. I was OK moving up to 10 dollars a month for all that I get. Adding another 10 on top for something that costs RING NOTHING for me to use. is unacceptable. This is just a money-grabbing paywall and it needs to stop.<br><br>Lastly,  the biggest operational con besides this is the poor integration with Alexa for scheduling camera functions. I.E. I do like getting driveway alerts via the alexa when motion is detected because its a blind spot inside my house. One window on the back side of the house can see the driveway due to garage location. I set a schedule or snooze it to not give motion alerts if I'm having people over and it completely ignores this schedule and gives endless motion alerts via the alexa devices. Stupid annoying and it seems people have been complaining about this on the forum since 2018. Great product, I have ring cameras around my house. This was by far the easiest one to install. I was able to take my doorbell out and put this one back on in about 5 minutes. Hard wiring is so simple! Ring camera has great quality and motion detection. The only down side is having to unscrew and replace the battery every 6-7 days with the recommended motion settings (low usage of battery). I would recommend getting the solar attachment with it. Be sure to check the sizing of the ring camera before purchasing, for our side paneling, the ring camera can only fit sideways (lol), but it does what it need to do-- capture any motion triggered. I live in an apartment, so I can't exactly get a Ring doorbell hardwired into the place. I didn't even have to screw this into the doorframe - Ring offers an accessory that allows you to stick the doorbell to the frame with a strong adhesive! Just make sure that you get one for the right model (totally not speaking from experience here lol)<br>I only have to charge the battery about once a month, and even then you can buy another battery so that you don't have to go several hours without coverage.<br>I feel so much safer having a camera on my door. I do have to pay for a monthly Ring subscription to keep my videos, but I think it's more than worth it. I also have a stick up camera and the alarm system inside and they've been great so far.<br><br>It's the little things I love about Ring, like being able to check the camera from the safety of my bed when I hear a noise outside or checking in on my place when I'm out of town. I use this product for when I'm at the far end of the house. I don't hear someone knocking Love it. Need this. Some people are intrusive and like to take from other people's yards. Not with this thing. Caught ya....😏 Great resolution and response, and even support personnel is great! Works well just takes time to connect to WiFi sometimes This is installed on a west facing wall and every afternoon I receive 1 or 2 false notifications. My guess is the sun effects the sensor. I have had 2 package deliveries to date where the camera did not capture the activity. I had to buy the plug in chimes but works great. Night vision and motion detection good. There is nothing I don’t like about this unit and I’m planning on getting another one soon! This is my second ring doorbell !have been very good. I like being able to see head to toe, also the color vision at night is phenomenal, it allows me to better distinguish people, objects and faces. It's so clear and very responsive. I’ve tried a couple other doorbell cameras, but this one works the best. Especially since we have an older home, so the wireless option is great! I had Ring Doorbell Pro about 5 years ago. The Ring button started to disintegrate and it didn't respond anymore. Therefore, I decided to buy a Ring Doorbell 4 for replacement as the price is more resonable. Well, it turned out that the night vision was too dark and the color was distorted. The wifi connection was very poor. But then I found out that Ring Doorbell Plus performs much better than Ring Doorbell 4, so I decided to return Ring Doorbell 4 and bought Ring Doorbell Plus. The result is day and night.<br>The video is clear. Night vision is bright and clear. No distortion. The wifi connection is great.<br>Comparing with the latest Ring Doorbell Pro which is over $200, The price friendly Ring Doorbell Plus is an excellent choice. Would be 5 stars if it didn’t skip a lot I’m afraid it will miss a big event skip right through it whenever I really do need it Love this product…<br>I accidentally turned on my small speaker to find the connectivity is on! Who knew!<br>The sound is louder than my phone! Should've taken a picture to go with the review, but we love it so far! Easy setup, easy installation. Picture quality/sound &amp; recording is all 10/10 for us. Works well.haveing issues with blueness of cam tho. Can't connect to app but works threw Alexa quite well. Only thing ide like it to do is keep the cam up instead of shutting off after 2 minutes or so. Easy to set up and install.<br><br>As for motion it doesn't  always seem to pick up that someone is coming or going from my door. As the battery drains, the worse it gets. I have this set up on my side door. It will only pick up and alert us to motion from my door 7 out of 10 times, if that. I will keep playing with the zones, maybe that is it. I have it set now that it won't pick up people walking up and down the street on the right side and have it set so it won't pick up my neighbors enjoying their backyards on the left side, which it did pick up a first until I had adjusted the zones. I work from home and have a parent with dementia. If it's a nice day he likes to go outside. He purposely wanders at this time and wanted something for when the time comes when he aimlessly wanders. We'll have to figure out what to do with our doors, but this would be a good backup in case he happens to get out the door(if it picks up his motion lol) so we can see which way he went.<br><br>I did buy the stick up cam also for the backyard to pick up where doorbell view ends, but have not set that up yet. So hopefully this cam will pick up motion that the doorbell did not. *crosses fingers*<br><br>It does not pick up or alert to any cars pulling into the driveway.<br><br>Picture quality at night is pretty good, but it has not alerted me at all during the night of any motion. Which I find odd as there's lots of animals that come out and wander at night. I haven't noticed any pawprints or hoofprints so maybe they haven't come around in front of the camera, but I doubt it.<br><br>I will keep this as I got it on sale, but I would not buy another one for the front door at full price. It doesn't seem worth it I absolutely love my Ring Doorbell. I do think the cost for Protection Plans are a little excessive. Love the birdseye view. Thats new I’m so happy with my ring doorbell!! All the things that were happening before I got it, are no longer happening. I feel safe now. I had the lower-cost Ring Doorbell for about a year now, and the one thing I hated the most about it was that to charge the battery, you had to remove THE ENTIRE DOORBELL. I had to remove the doorbell once a month... until lately when something started causing the doorbell to drain to 0-percent in about 7-8 days. This is not good and such a hassle to have to recharge the doorbell when charging time takes hours! I thought at first that with the optional \"hardwired kit\" it this wouldn't be a problem, but the hardwire kit isn't even to power the unit at all - it only trickle charges it! So if your doorbell is using more power than the trickle charge can put back in, then it's pointless.<br><br>I dealt with that for about a month more until Amazon had their Prime Deals event, and when I saw that the more expensive Ring Battery Doorbell Plus was on sale, I bought it.<br><br>So here I am with a newer, more expensive, higher model Ring Battery Doorbell Plus. The mounting holes for the Ring Battery Doorbell Plus are different from the Ring Doorbell, I don't know why they couldn't keep something standard but apparently, all of the various doorbell versions have their own different mounting pattern. Once I got past this hurdle, the rest of the installation was easy and quick.<br><br>With the new Ring Battery Doorbell Plus, I immediately gained two good features: first, the camera view was much taller, they were serious when they said it has a \"floor to ceiling\" view as I can see much more with the newer doorbell - great for when I have deliveries. Second: the removable battery just fixes the biggest flaw of my original Ring Doorbell. I bought a second battery just in case after having such a bad time with the original doorbell, but it seems like the Battery Doorbell Plus is much more efficient with the power, as I have had it installed for a couple of months now and the lowest I saw the battery dip down to was 87%. Picture quality is very good throughout the day, even in the evening with the porch lamp on I can see visitor faces clearly and not blown out like other cameras.<br><br>So if you're looking for your first Ring doorbell, do not get the cheapest $50 version - do yourself a favor and go right to the Battery Doorbell Plus, it is worth the higher price and you don't have to deal with the shortcomings of the cheaper, basic version I'm highly impressed with the ease of installation and the overall quality of the video. I opted not to hard wire it to my existing doorbell but rather use the included internal battery. I used Velcro to attach the camera to my storm door. Once you have it installed,go into your settings on the app and turn on HDR video and night vision. This gives you a color video picture.<br>Each time someone approaches my door,I get a motion alert even before they push the doorbell button on the camera.<br>I definitely recommend this product. I have had this unit for approx. 4 months now and have a few comments. When the unit works it is really good, but it simply stops working sometimes and why that happens is a mystery to me and Ring is no help. Here are a couple of the issue I have.<br><br>1. It seems to work fine for 24 hours and then it will stop sending notifications to my Samsung phone. I have to reboot the phone to get the notifications once again.<br>2. Most days it does not exhibit any noticeable lag between detection and notification, but sometimes the lag can be up to 90 seconds. Nothing would have changed regarding orientation to the modem receiving the signal yet the lag is there.<br>3. The almost worthless little instruction manual that comes with the product clearly states \"Download the full manual online.\". Yet the manual for this product is nowhere to be found online and when I finally chatted with customer service they informed me that a downloadable manual does not exist yet. I am not sure if that was trying to tell me that one would be forthcoming or just forget it pal, you get no manual. I was furnished with a Youtube link that had many informative videos, could have found that myself.<br><br>If I could figure out the little annoyances detailed above I would give it a higher rating. If it worked it would be ideal for my apartment, porch pirates are an issue in this area. I like it because it notifies me if someone is in my driveway and or @ my front door. Feel safer! ! Works great very clear video. The only thing is for your videos to be saved.You do have to pay a subscription fee Much better upgrade than the old Ring 2 I had. Love the picture and removable battery. Easy to use love the video quality and brings me the peace of mind when it come to watching over my car and home definitely worth it’s money Easy to install and set up. Everything we wanted from a video doorbell. Night vision is good as well. We’ve used Ring for many many years and love their products! We just purchased the new “Battery Doorbell Plus” when our OG decided to go kaput. i’m sure eight years of Iowa winters had something to do with the life expectancy of our original product.<br>If you’re going to use the rechargeable battery option, instructions are straightforward and it’s very simple to install and use. However, if you are going to hardwire your doorbell to run through an existing house doorbell system, the sticker on the back denotes DC power when it is indeed AC power.<br>**We found the correct instructions on the Ring website.<br>Good thing I am married to a part-time electrician! it does works fine. after you figure it out! The directions to install were super easy. The learning was getting the app on phone ( i did not have a doorbell prior, so was trying for the ring to go to phone) that did work great...but i also needed sound when phones were not home. so bought the ring accessory to. You should know that both run on WiFi. then I had to learn where and how to set perimeters for detection etc. this is not difficult to figure out, but you will need more than a few minutes to look thru the options for bells and motion and so on. for example, the city bus set my Ring off every time it went by until i changed the zone.<br>i do like it and do recommend it. Once he got this installed, he loved it. It’s all he is talking about. Took some trial and error to set up zones due to my awkward front door, but works perfectly now. Picture is very clear and alerts are prompt I just received it yesterday &amp; it works great. Easy to set up. Should’ve gotten one sooner. The case that is on it I purchased seperately. Can’t figure out how to hang this. So annoyed. And ring is super hard to contact for support.<br><br>So, I am amending my original review because after that Ring went above and beyond to help me install my upgraded doorbell. Link reached out to me and walked me through what I needed to do and supplied video support. As frustrating as the process was the upgraded doorbell is really worth it. I can get all angles of my front step and the camera quality is so much better. So thank you for the follow through to the Ring customer service team. Necesario para las personas q necesitan privacidad Great video doorbell Bought this after seeing my brother's regular ring camera. After some research, this seemed to be the best value for the money. I can see my top step now and get alerts when packages are left near my door. Happy with how it works and probably will buy a second one for my backdoor later on. My one complaint is that it would be nice to turn off the cloud integration and self-host this locally only, but this isn't the product for that. This security camera works well. I purchased this on a holiday season special to replace a 4 year old previous model. my old ring was set up using battery only - because I live in a townhouse where the build in doorbell is mounted on a side wall facing wrong direction. I managed with the old ring charging it about every 8 weeks. When I got the new Ring doorbell plus, I originally thought the battery life was going to be problem and was unable to really turn on all of the features because every time the app would warn me about battery life and it already seemed not as good as the older ring.<br><br>So to solve this, I kept the new ring and found a way to run a wire from my old doorbell button to the spot where the ring is mounted and replaced the doorbell transformer with one that meets Ring's power source specs. Once the device is hardwired - it runs on battery but trickle charges to keep it at or close to 100% charge. Now I was able to increase snapshot capture, motion detection and fully take advantage of this model. The motion and package detection work well and the camera is a nice improvement over the previous model from 4 years ago that I replaced.<br><br>Overall 5 stars if you have a power source. If you don' t have a power source and rely on battery, your results may vary. This ring battery doorbell is a big improvement over the one I've had since Ring first became a company, the camera clarity is very clear and finally I can see a head to toe picture, I didn't give it 5 stars because this doorbell I purchased was supposed to be new and there were scratches on the face of the camera like it had been a used, I didn't bother returning because I had installed it and peeled off the plastic and then the scratches were noticable so before you install be sure to inspect what you bought before installing since they do sell gently used products, I just wish I didn't pay for a new doorbell when I clearly got a used one Cannot compare to other sorts of units, but this one works quite well. A wizz to install (on battery power), and a pile of features which menu on your phone. One can buy additional eyes.<br><br>Believe that the woman who was investigated by federal agents had a system with an additional eye. And were her  \"barking dogs\" real or a Ring feature? (I have that feature silenced. )<br><br>Noticed, recently, that my two across street neighbors have installed Ring units. Guess they saw the same \"visit\" on YouTube. Great camera worth the price. The charge is very quick too. The sound quality is okay. It connects quick tooZ the image quality and performance is great as well. My older was not good,  so we replace and it's much better view Yup...Works Good I agree with all the pros. This device is outstanding. The only con is charging.<br>We have frequent visitors to our front porch which means frequent doorbell activations. Even so, the battery lasts at least 3 months.<br>Charging: The device must be opened to release the battery, which then has to be connected to charging power via a micro usb. There is no external port to connect a charging cable, like the older Rings had. There is a screw at the bottom which secures the silver cover. Remove the cover and the battery comes out easily. The usb port is at the top of the battery. Today we pulled the battery at 30% and it took 5 hours to fully charge. To reassemble, the battery goes back inside, install the silver cover, and secure the cover and battery with a tiny screw. We have our Ring in a security frame which adds one more layer of metal to put the little screw at the bottom through. The battery hole does not fully align with the cover hole so it's necessary to kind of put a push pressure the direction needed to line them up. The hole is at the bottom, so to see if they're lined up requires neck craning and a flashlight. Oh my goodness that little screw is hard to put in.<br>Ring does not currently offer a solar charger for this model. I'm not sure how they could design one, with the port all the way at the top, deep inside the device, but I'm no engineer. This model would be a dream if it had an optional solar charger. We love the Ring doorbell. Highly recommend it. Fast and easy installation and the app is very easy to use. I absolutely love this thing in fact I'm going to get one for my garage and one for the back door This is a great product. I have a 91 year old Dad and while I’m at work, I can see every one that comes to the front door and can speak to them as well. I can see the houses across the street and both driveways to the right and left. It’s a great product for the money. I don’t know why I didn’t buy this sooner than I did!! ! Don’t let the “battery powered” statement cause you to pause. The rechargeable battery will last at least 2 months before needing an overnight recharge. Your phone or any other Alexa product you have in the home eliminate the need to hook up a doorbell. The only installation simpler is if they would put some peel and stick tape on the back of the product. Easy to install. Works great, no problems. Recommend highly Added a solar panel to it &amp; stays charged, great picture head to toe, install instructions could be better showing which screws go where my only complaint haha We needed a little security on our home, especially while we are away. Now we can see what's going on at any time day or night. The Ring subscription works great too. And why can't they make a cell phone battery that last like the one in the Ring Door Bell? At the current rate it won't need charging for 5 to 6 months! Like it. Wish it was a little smaller so it could fit near the old doorbell is. Now to mount on my brick to mount it. But like the quality of the videos. I have purchased two other brand wireless camera doorbells in the past. They were terrible and I ended up returning them. This one is perfect. I literally have no complaints. It is always connected and because I also purchased the optional solar panel, I have never had to charge this doorbell. I have had it for over a year. So easy to install and set up. Give us peace of mind I purchased this a while ago. I was intimidated, because, I thought it was going to be hard to program. It was real ease to setup. I purchased this with another item to hang on the door and a separate door bell. I love this setup. It was an excellent buy. This is an upgrade over my Ring 2<br>It is not significantly better though which is what I hoped for given that is is several years newer.<br>Other notes about using Ring.<br>If you have a few devices (like I do) 2 doorbells 1 camera and 1 chime you should really do that annual subscription which is cheaper than doing a few of these devices at around $30 / year.<br>I am still somewhat disappointed with motion detection (people coming or going without getting recorded or just the tail end of this.) I did convert to AC power years ago and have the motion sensitivity set to high but it is still disappointing at times and I do IT for a living and have very low db wifi signal to my doorbells so poor wifi is not the source of these issues either.\n",

            "Reviews:   I couldn't be happier with my Amazon Echo Pop in Midnight Teal! This little device packs a punch and has quickly become an essential part of my daily routine. Here are all the reasons why it deserves a full 5 stars:<br><br>1. Compact Yet Powerful: Don’t let the small size fool you. The Echo Pop delivers full, rich sound that fills the room. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tunes, catching up on podcasts, or enjoying an audiobook, the audio quality is superb. It's amazing how such a compact speaker can produce such a big, clear sound!<br><br>2. Stunning Design: The Midnight Teal color is simply gorgeous. It adds a touch of elegance and modernity to any room. The sleek, minimalist design blends perfectly with my home decor, making it both a functional and stylish addition.<br><br>3. Alexa Integration: Having Alexa at my fingertips is a game-changer. From setting timers and reminders to controlling my smart home devices, Alexa makes everything so much easier. I love being able to ask for weather updates, play music, or even get recipe ideas hands-free. The voice recognition is incredibly accurate, even from across the room.<br><br>4. Easy Setup: Setting up the Echo Pop was a breeze. The Alexa app guided me through the process step-by-step, and I was up and running in just a few minutes. The app also offers plenty of customization options to tailor the device to my preferences.<br><br>5. Versatile and Smart: This smart speaker is so versatile. I use it in the kitchen for recipes and timers, in the living room for music and news, and even as a bedside companion for alarms and sleep sounds. It seamlessly integrates with other smart home devices, making it a central hub for my smart home ecosystem.<br><br>6. Excellent Value: For the price, the Echo Pop offers outstanding value. It combines premium sound quality, smart features, and a sleek design at an affordable price point. It’s a perfect entry-level smart speaker for anyone looking to enhance their home with smart technology.<br><br>Overall, the Amazon Echo Pop in Midnight Teal is a fantastic product that delivers on all fronts. It’s stylish, powerful, and incredibly smart. Whether you’re new to the world of smart speakers or looking to expand your Alexa ecosystem, the Echo Pop is an excellent choice. Highly recommended! I got these for my garage to place next to my tool cabinet. The color matches my cabinet pretty well. I liked how easy they were to set up and even pair together. Other versions of these gave me a little more hassle to set up as a pair, but not these! The sound is really good given their size and configuration. I'm really impressed, plus they're compact. Just wish the cords had an option to be longer or order a longer version. Seems like they really had these in mind for a kitchen setup as the cords wouldn't really work even for a standard floor outlet setup. I'm just lucky that my tool cabinet has a power strip built in, so the cord is just long enough to work for what I wanted.<br>Given the size and the cost, especially on sale, these are a great value for the money. Plus if you have Alexa in other parts of your house, they seem to have figured out the setup to integrate into an existing system. And if these will be your first, they are really easy to get going. Originally my family had only a first generation Alexa echo device and it has been helpful in the kitchen. I had not thought another was necessary till we started installing lighting and plugs that claimed to be Alexa compatible. We now have an Alexa for each bedroom that is connected to the bedroom lights for easy voice activated on and off features. Makes lighting the darkness very easy and user friendly. The device does an excellent job at recognizing different levels of voices and knows very well which device you are talking to. This Alexa Pop also has pretty decent speaker abilities for playing music. The seamless integration with all my Alexa devices and those who are compatible with Alexa has been a great experience and I'm looking to find more devices that can be controlled like this to grow my smart home capabilities. The Amazon Echo Pop was my first experience with an Alexa device, and I could kick myself for not buying 2 of these at the sale price of just under $23. At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.<br><br>Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said “Alexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.” It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn’t necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn’t going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.<br><br>That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can’t function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn’t have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.<br><br>Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren’t exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.<br><br>I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.<br><br>One other issue is with the alarm level. I can’t seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it’s time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.<br><br>Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as “Peaceful Current Radio,” or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.<br><br>Update:<br>I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can’t match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I’m considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.<br><br>Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can’t find that in my Apple music library.<br><br>I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:<br>Peaceful current Radio<br>New Standard WNYC<br>IPR Studio 1<br>KTUX FM<br>KSRY FM<br>WJIB FM<br>Café Del Mar Radio<br>Americana Boogey Radio<br>Aloha Joe<br>Quiet Village Radio<br>WSBZ FM<br>Smooth Jazz 101<br>WABE Classical<br><br>Just ask Alexa to play any of these, and get ready for a treat. This has a better speaker than my relatively new Alexa with a screen, which is great because I use them a lot for music. It was super easy to set up with the Alexa app since I have another, it only took 2 minutes to set up. I haven't had any issues so far. We use this one in the bedroom for alarms, music, and to turn off the smart lights in the house when going to bed. I like that this one doesn't have a camera or the screens that's constantly showing amazon ads, our other one is basically a shopping billboard so we shoved it into a storm trooper helmet and named her Kevin... who needs the screens anyway? With the screen, I guess you can do the family photo display, but it still is at least 60% ads instead of a digital photo display like I was promised. They advertise the screened Echos with things like 'oh you can watch cooking videos and the news and do a family photo screen saver\" but that is what I have a phone for, if I need to watch something I'm more likely to use a TV or a laptop or even an iPad or my phone, the Echo is a last resort that will never happen. My phone has an easier interface, and its own AI assistant. Theyre also like \"you can video chat your amazon contacts\" but amazon is not social media, I'm not gonna collect amazon contacts and video chat them, and have yall head or facetime,,, or a phone?? Like no thank you, the screen on these things is just annoying and not aesthetically pleasing with all the weird ads that it didn't used to have, I never even see the screensaver with the time showing in forever and can't change the settings because amazon wants it to be a billboard. I really liked the screen when it used to be the time and I could use it as a clock, but no longer, that was the only thing I liked on the screen. Get the Pop instead, it's cheaper and wildly better. All the extra features they offer you for other models are a scam and you'll never use them, the Pop is great. I wish they'd bring back the panda face version, that one was cute. I recently purchased the Amazon Echo Dot from Amazon and it has been a fantastic addition to my home. The sound quality is impressive for its size, offering clear audio and powerful bass. The Alexa voice assistant is highly responsive and accurate, easily picking up commands even in background noise. Its sleek and compact design fits well with any decor. Beyond music and smart home control, it offers numerous features such as news updates, alarm, and reminders. So I am a beginner in the Alexa world and this one is my very first Echo device ever. Bought it absolutely occasionally while browsing the Amazon. I was actually looking for some kind of gift ideas for my almost 9 years old daughter (she was always so excited to visit our friends and neighbors and talk to Alexa lol). And the $19 offer popped up in my screen for this little device (refurbished). I decided to give it a try. In the next day or two a $14 offer for a brand new one popped up and of course I bought it right away. My daughter’s birthday is in few days but I couldn’t wait myself to try it so I decided to give this present to her yesterday saying she will have tons of gifts on her actual birthday date anyway. You should’ve seen her happy face! It’s just unbelievable! Did not have much time to set it up yesterday, was afraid if something goes wrong I could become confused and just forget this idea of having Alexa at home which will make my daughter to feel upset. So started today. Now I see I should’ve started it yesterday. Gosh, whole initial setup took less than 5 minutes including unpacking and pairing with the app. Alexa momentarily was ready to listen. As you can see on my video I just asked some simple questions to perform the test. And despite my accent (english is not my native language) I’ve got very clear answers. Amazing! Of course and as always while buying something I’ve got through some negative reviews. A number of people say the sound quality is below their expectations. Really? Do you really expect a 12 inches Bose quality sound for $14? In my honest opinion for such a compact speaker the sound quality is a way above the average. It doesn’t just sound great for such a compact size but it also very loud and clear. I measured the device - it’s only 4 inches in diameter and I’m pretty sure the actual speaker itself is even smaller (but can’t confirm because it’s not visible from outside). Some people say they can’t get it to work at all, numerous say it’s doesn’t do anything right unless you buy something, some find another negative reasons. I do not know and have no clue what they are talking about. It works seamlessly! For now, as a beginner, I love all the features it offers, for example I don’t have to look for a button to turn the alarm off, I just touched it somewhere and alarm stopped (couple of minutes later I realized it was a snooze mode so I actually asked Alexa to stop the alarm (just the alarm clock itself could cost me more than this speaker by the way)). Really love a whisper feature. If you whisper Alexa will whisper back - wow! Isn’t it great if everyone else is sleeping in your house, for example?! Real time news, weather, music, reminders, alarms and many many more to discover. I feel like we have a new family member and some genius companion at home lol. I’m truly admired and amazed by all this new  technologies. Special thanks to designers for a different color choice. I would choose black or white, my wife - purple, but my daughters favorite color is green so she got a right one. Now I am finishing to write this long review and start integrating all my smart cameras and devices with our new companion - was always wondering all those devices saying “Compatible with Alexa” on a box. So it’s time to try! Of course if something goes wrong I will update my review here and maybe join the group of negative reviewers but something tells me it’s not going to happen. Usually my first impression stays with me forever. But we will see. For now this little companion honestly deserves its 5 stars. Hope someone will find my review helpful. This was a gift for my daughter as she wanted a speaker for her room, but also something that she could use for other things as well. It is super light weight, cute, great quality, and modern to add to her room. I have not owned one before so I had to dig a little on the information to adjust it to a kids setting for connectivity. After I figured it out, everything else was a breeze to set up. There are still many other features I have yet to use and can’t wait to figure out. It was an amazing value for the product. The speaker is surprisingly loud and gives great quality for how small and compact it is. I've had a little AM/FM radio in my kitchen for many (many) years. Over the past year or so, the reception has been getting fuzzier and fuzzier - a result of so many other things clogging the waves? - and needed a replacement.<br><br>I have resisted getting anything Alexa related, as it felt very intrusive to me. I've never liked the idea of a \"smart\" home, and have been happily living in a \"dumb\" home for many, many years. When thinking about a replacement for my kitchen radio, I started looking into the details around Alexa and what it actually would or could do.<br><br>The setup was fairly easy - with a couple of hiccups along the way - and I've got it set up to use the barest of minimum activity with it. I haven't explored probably 80% of what this thing can do, and I likely will not (see the instrusive comment above.) But I found that I like that I can say, \"Alexa, play WNYC-FM\" or \"Alexa, play BBC World Service,\" or \"Alexa, stop playing.\" That's all I've used this for, and it's all I wanted it for.<br><br>The price was excellent on this little thing - I got it on sale, for $15. The size is perfect for my use - putting it on a little shelf in my kitchen. And the sound is absolutely outstanding! These three factors leads me to happily recommend it.<br><br>If you've been like me, with privacy concerns, etc., I can say that now that I've been using it - with limited use - I've slightly changed my mind with regard to this specific device. I still don't like the idea of a kind of an AI thing in my apartment, but for this: it's really, really neat. So earlier I wrote a nasty review below with one star. I then left feedback directly through my Alexa echo that was just about as nasty. A support rep reached out by phone the next day as a result and then sent me an email with instructions how to resolve problem below. I should have just asked for help before losing it lol. But thin skin these days like a lot of us dealing with issues in world right now. Anyway problem is fixed and wanted to give a big shout out to the support team for their quick help and having to deal with me! 😌<br><br>Orig Feedback<br>At some point I had about 50 different devices associated with insteon. That company went out of business and then came back but logins don't work anymore etc... I made the unfortunate mistake sometime back of linking Alexa to insteon. Alexa is too stupid to completely unlink from the app on their end. I can delete one by one each of the 50 devices but every time I want to add a new device it auto discovers all of them again. And then tells me to fully unlink I need to also go to the manufacturer site which is not possible. Without being able to go back to the manufacturer insteon and complete the unlinking from there side they will never go away. This is making the experience, the management of devices, and the display of devices a big sloppy mess for my end. Used to be a website associated with Alexa but that's also gone. And clearly the app is only there for the most basic scenarios. So if you want to avoid my mistake it's simple don't buy Alexa. It's one of those situations where it works great until it absolutely takes a nosedive and doesn't for ever more. Probably has a lot to do with layoffs and lack of investments in this area which I heard is going the wrong direction AKA downhill for Alexa. I guess if people want it to turn on their Philips colored light in their bedroom more power to you. But if you want to use it as a more serious home automation tool ,whole house, then understand this type of limitation is devastating. Even my Google devices can be permanently unlinked without me having to go back to the manufacturer. But I've come to hate Google for similar reasons because they also are de-investing and now I have to deal with other problems including saying hey Google multiple times before it actually responds. So disappointed in these companies and this field of work. They both promised so much for the next decade and have woefully undelivered on those promises. Guess I will wait until a more AI capable unit becomes affordable because they are out there but not yet mainstream enough. Good luck everyone. First time owning a device like this, the setting up was fairly simple for a middle aged guy that's not totally tech savvy. I use it to make grocery lists that it sends to the app, use it for reminder because I forget some times when I'm boiling eggs,check the weather and use it to answer any questions I have. I also use it to operate mu roku TV and my roku TV stick on another TV. I use it to play my pandora radio stations,Sirius cm and tunein radio. Helpful tip: If Alexa doesn't synch with your apps through the Alexa app, I had great success linking my apps to Alexa from those particular apps. I linked Pandora to Alexa from the Pandora app etc. As for the sound,it sounds great for a small device and gets loud. It was a great value for the $19.99 sale price! I already had an Alexa account, and when I set it up, it started connecting to my WiFi and all I needed was to have the app open and boom! It was set up! So almost 3 months later I just wanted to share that it works just as good as it did when I first bought it. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a cheaper smart speaker that is good quality, and has bass. Again, super easy to set up and worked just fine since I already had an account. The device also almost looks like they cut the Echo Dot in half and made the Echo Pop. It looks very cool and has an amazing color! (glacier white) I recently got the Amazon Echo Pop, and it's a fantastic little device overall, earning a solid 4 stars. Its great sound quality and small size allow it to fit pretty much anywhere—bedroom, living room, bathroom, office, or any small space.<br><br>Despite its compact size, the sound quality is impressive, making it perfect for playing music, audiobooks, and podcasts via Alexa. It seamlessly connects to my favorite services like Amazon Music, Spotify, and more, and the Bluetooth streaming works flawlessly throughout my space.<br><br>However, I've noticed that Alexa seems to be getting less reliable lately. There have been multiple instances of wrong answers, incorrect actions, and poor responses. While the device itself is great, these issues with Alexa can be frustrating when trying to use voice commands for smart home control or simple tasks.<br><br>This Echo device still turns any space into a smart space, easily controlling compatible smart home devices with voice commands or the Alexa App. Plus, it makes everyday tasks easier by setting timers, checking the weather, reading the news, and much more.<br><br>The Amazon Echo Pop is a great, affordable smart speaker with excellent sound quality and a compact design that fits anywhere. If only Alexa's performance were more consistent, this would be a perfect device. Our house is Alexia run and all our lights and other things are voice controlled. We never saw a reason to have one in our bedroom until we bought a pole lamp to sit by a new chair we added to our bedroom. The lamp was nice and just what we wanted but it had a floor control which made us want to return it'  I put a smart light bulb in it and bought this small Echo to sit on the table around the lamp and it solved our problem! The unit works great and it's very inexpensive! I highly recommend it. Sound quality is great! I have no complaints. Great product! I named my Echo Willow and I like to think of her as a friend. She makes little things easier like setting reminders and timers. I would have even more uses for her if I was in school right now, but i’m not. The speaker is really good and I like that you can set alarms to play a song. The only downside is that alarms and reminders go off super loud (i think i can fix that in the app but i haven’t figured that out yet) and I don’t use it as much as i thought i would. But still, love her. This is such a nice addition to the kitchen I cut a 2x8 into a corner shelf, mounted this under my cabinets. Making sure to give it additional acoustic performance helps out! It’s has no problem connecting to my WiFi, the value is great because my kids and I love playing games with Alexa while cooking when compared to other smart speakers it’s similar with output but none of my other portable speakers link up with each other like a quick sound system to play my favorite music through out the home. Choose your favorite color and enjoy it! I’ve been searching for a speaker cuz the one I had is long gone lol but this Alexa so worth it not only does it play music you can talk too her I don’t have too go too my phone and change the music like my old speaker lol I can ask her too skip or even better ask her about the weather and time and too set alarms lol and etc she just amazing and I don’t regret buying Alexa 🤭 I didn’t really need this, but it was on sale, so I bought it. I am so glad I did! I have this one in my kitchen, and it’s nice to have another Alexa so close. I also can’t get over the great sound quality. It sounds just like my Amazon Echoes. I’m very happy with this purchase! If I would’ve known how much I like this and use it, I would’ve purchased it a few years ago.<br><br>Also, for those of you who don’t know, you can create a group with all of your Echoes, Pops, etc. I have done that, so when I turn on my music, I turn it on throughout the entire house. You can Google how to do it. Super easy and also nice for when you’re having a party. I had an old dot and got the chance to get a newer one for a good price. So I went for it. The sound it better. It's very easy to set up and I like that I can ask Alexa to play some music when I can not sleep. Also she works with my smart plug and I can turn on my fan or light when I need it.<br>Alexa will tell you a joke, current weather, make sounds for you, anything you ask her. Kinda nice having an assistant when you need one.<br>I also use her to make meow sounds and keep my cats on their toes. Setting it up was a breeze, and the voice recognition is surprisingly accurate—even with my morning voice! I love how it seamlessly integrates with other smart devices in my home, allowing me to control lights, adjust the thermostat, and even order groceries with just a voice command.<br><br>If you’re looking to add convenience and fun to your home, the Amazon Echo is a must-have. It’s reliable, entertaining, and incredibly handy. I can’t imagine my home without it now! I have a big echo in my bedroom where I find I ask alexa to control things all over the house and give me updates and wanted something smaller for two other spots in my house my big den and kitchen. I purchased 2 echo's so if I'm cooking and don't want to use me dirty hands or even have free hands to touch my phone I can now ask alexa to turn things on and off around my house in addition to giving me updates on my ring app. I'm so happy i did this because i just feel safer knowing i can control things all over without having to yell and alexa does that for me I'm having so much fun with this. I got light bulbs and love that I can get lights turned on and off. I have used it from phone when away from home to turn on night light if I'm coming home in the dark. Love playing music when I'm in the bathroom when getting ready. I don't have prime music, but Alexa will shuffle some artists. I even tell her good night. You can set reminders and get Amazon delivery notifications. Alexa will also ask if you'd like to reorder vitamins, etc. Love it! Great sound quality for a small device. I purchased the battery base as I wanted to extend my music group outside. It won’t blast the neighbors but has good sound in a small area. When it’s plugged in at my kitchen it adds stereo quality in the kitchen family room area used with an echo. I purchased it on sale so it was definitely a good value. Small and compact. Easy to set up using the Alexa app. As a seasoned audiophile constantly on the quest for sonic perfection, I recently had the privilege of immersing myself in the transcendent realm of the Echo Pop Speaker. Allow me to articulate the sheer brilliance encapsulated within this audio masterpiece.<br><br>At first glance, the Echo Pop exudes an aura of elegance, with its minimalist design and impeccable craftsmanship. Its sleek contours and premium finishes seamlessly integrate into any living space, epitomizing a harmonious fusion of form and function.<br><br>Yet, it's upon pressing play that the true magic unfolds. The Echo Pop unleashes an auditory symphony that transcends the boundaries of conventional sound reproduction. With unparalleled clarity and precision, every note resonates with breathtaking authenticity, captivating the soul and igniting a profound connection to the music.<br><br>What sets the Echo Pop apart is its ability to deliver a truly immersive listening experience. Equipped with advanced audio technologies, including custom-tuned drivers and precision-engineered enclosures, it effortlessly navigates the intricate nuances of each composition, unveiling layers of detail previously obscured.<br><br>Whether you're delving into the intricate melodies of classical orchestras or surrendering to the pulsating rhythms of contemporary beats, the Echo Pop adapts with unparalleled versatility, ensuring an enthralling encounter with every genre and musical preference.<br><br>Furthermore, the Echo Pop's dynamic range is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the gentle whisper of a violin to the thunderous roar of a bass drum, it effortlessly traverses the entire spectrum of frequencies, delivering a sonic experience that transcends mere listening and evolves into a visceral journey through the essence of sound.<br><br>But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Echo Pop is its ability to evoke emotion. Beyond its technical prowess lies an intangible quality—a soulful resonance that stirs the heart and awakens the senses. Each listening session becomes a transformative experience, imbued with the power to uplift, inspire, and transport you to realms unknown.<br><br>In conclusion, the Echo Pop Speaker stands as a testament to the pursuit of sonic perfection. With its captivating design, unparalleled performance, and soul-stirring resonance, it transcends the realm of mere audio equipment to become a gateway to musical enlightenment. Embrace the journey, and let the symphony of life unfold before you. The speaker works good but it would be nice if it had just a little more bass. Sometimes doesn't always connect to wifi you have to re do it if the signal is weak, but over all for the price it's a great product that has a lot of features like appointment reminders, alarm clock, read your emails and texts for you so for the price very worth it I got the Echo Pop because it was on sale for $19 and thought it was a great deal. I got one in teal and black (both are great). The teal is a beautiful color, and has a matte finish. I was impressed with the wi-fi signal because it works in one of the bedrooms where wi-fi tends to be spotty. The sound quality is really great for a $20 speaker, and the voice recognition is also really good in understanding my voice to my child's voice. One catch is that if you have two of these near each other, they will both answer - so be sure to keep them separate with the doors closed. I also like that I was able to seamlessly have my Spotify playlists play on the Echo Pop. I downloaded the App prior to receiving the item, and set up was super easy (less than 5 minutes). It's a great stocking stuffer or office gift too. My daughter has been asking for an Alexa for a while, I saw this was on sale so I purchased it. She is just turning 10 so I didn’t really want to pay a whole lot. It does what she wants though. Plays music, jokes, “floor is lava”, and answering whatever questions she can come up with. And I was able to get it in her favorite color, purple which was a huge plus! As for connecting it too smart devices, that feature is not something we currently use. But might incorporate in the future with turning on and off her bedroom lights. But overall it was a great purchases for the price! I mostly use this to play green noise so I can sleep at night. I also use it to check the weather, rate purchases when it reminds me to do so, check the time when I’m not wearing my watch, and entertain my grandson. It’s cute, it doesn’t take up much space, and it gives a pretty pop of color in my neutral colored bedroom. I absolutely love the Amazon Echo Pop! I have one in my bathroom, and it works like a charm. The sound quality is fantastic. I swear it works even better than my Echo Show in the bedroom. It's super easy to control all my smart plugs with it, and the connectivity is flawless. It can hear me perfectly even with the shower running, the vent on, and music playing all at once. Just make sure to turn on adaptive volume for the best experience! Plus, it's great value for money. This little device is a game-changer for sure! I bought this Echo Pop in late November 2023 and since April this year (2024) it has not worked. I've done the set up time after time. This was my second 'Alexa' device in 3 years and can't totally recommend the product. The first one I bought died and I had to buy this second one.<br>UPDATE:  Amazon called me and spent over an hour with me getting this Echo device to work. They were wonderful and it was a problem with internet, NOT THE DEVICE. We have 3 of them in our house. Very thankful for Amazon taking the initiatize to call me and work to get it working!! ! Note: purchased when it was on sale<br><br>For the price it does all the Alexa features. Sound is good. Easy to plug in and use.<br><br>Does not have the time display or some of the other visuals. Similar to the Echo Dot, and bigger with a fuller sound for music. Bass seems to be improved. And the volume gets loud enough for music to carry across large spaces. My father grew up with those big old European radios with the dials that were like BERLIN ... ROME ... BUCHAREST ... and as long as the atmosphere and the authorities cooperated, you could always find something to listen to. After immigrating to the US he recreated that experience with a shortwave radio and then a succession of internet radios, but now his gear is breaking or being bricked at just the point in his life when he can't seek out repairs or workarounds. I got him the Echo on a whim and he is delighted. He is mainly (perhaps exclusively) using it to listen to CBC Music, and I'm thrilled that he again has something to listen to other than cable news.<br><br>The sound quality isn't ever going to match the now-dormant Bang &amp; Olufsen system gathering dust, but for a device of this size, it is remarkable. This is my first experience with a smart speaker too and I'm a little perplexed that the voice commands are less AI-y than one might have expected. I think you need to utter a precise phrase in order to bring in a radio station. For example, \"Alexa, play Australian Broadcasting Corporation Classical\" won't work; it has to be \"Alexa, play ABC Classic One\" or \"Alexa, play ABC Classic Two.\" And listening to the CBC involved verbally navigating a hierarchy that I can't quite remember now, but it makes the difference between pulling in a local on-air station or a national internet station. This may have something to do with \"Alexa skills,\" which I haven't fully comprehended yet. Is, for example, CBC a \"skill\" and the CBC's various feeds fall beneath this skill? And if so, what is the correct way to activate them?<br><br>So, I have some learning to do, but in the meantime the Pop has been a smashing success in bringing music back into my father's house. I bought this for my daughter’s room. She had an older one that kept freezing up. I like this o e so much better. She sets alarms, has custom alarms with her name and weather report each morning. She even has it customized as a cat! She has fun playing with the it. This was the missing component to my home office. I needed an Alexa device that wasn't too expensive to be able to get alerts in my office instead of having to shout or be heard by one of the others in my house. The sound is excellent and i couldn't ask for more out of the device at the price point I got it at! Amazon probably didn't test this thing to see if it could handle raw Florida weather for months at a time. No problems.<br><br>Has no issues syncing with other echos for multi-room music either. Sounds about the same as a standard echo. Maybe slightly worse if you consider that two of them would sound better. Now my second order of an Alexa product as I was tired of fumbling for the lamp switch in the dark. Now before entering the dark room, Alexa lights the way with the separately purchased switch. Live all the routines you can establish. Having lights come on at dusk particularly when we’re not home. Easy to setup and truly love it. I bought this as a gift for my niece she absolutely loves it! She is able to play her own music in her room and feel like a big girl! I then bought one for myself and it is so helpful since I am constantly going my Alexa makes it easy to remember events and set me up for the day! This was definitely value for money, the sound quality is good, the connectivity is pretty good as well. The colour give a pop to a dark room. The app can be a little complex and misleading depending on what you need but generally speaking the quality and performance is good. Have it on my deck and it sounds great... such an inexpensive speaker that gives full sound and is Alexa capable. I cannot abide thin, tinny music . I have no problem with this. It's no Bose but it makes my life nicer and easier at minimal expense. I love the sound that this echo pop has. I have not stopped using it since I received it yesterday. Thank you so much Amazon you guys rock. The ease of use of this echo is absolutely wonderful. This echo pop was also easy to connect with my other devices. No complaints. Okay first of all, this speaker is so cute. I love the color &amp; overall design so much.<br>As for the functionality, it is great. The sound is clear, the volume definitely gets loud if you’re looking for that, and it’s incredibly easy to set up &amp; use. My only complaint is that it’s 2024 &amp; the Alexa speakers still aren’t wireless. It’s able to be used as a regular Bluetooth speaker so I see no reason why it can’t be wireless &amp; portable. I am not much of an technical person, but finally got it put together. It works wonderfully and as I am elderly I really needed this in my bedroom just in case I got sick during the night. It sure has relieved my mind that I have someone to call in case of an emergency. More plusses are an alarm, soft music and answers to questions I may have. I really love it! I bought this echo pop for my finished basement. It gives off great sounds for its size and has no problem being connected to wifi (my modem is upstairs on the  other side of the house). I have a lamp in the basement with a smart light bulb and I regularly use Alexa/the echo pop to control the light. No complaints except that I wish the cord was longer for better placement in the room. El sonido no es tan bueno, y básicamente en la casa lo utilizan para escuchar música y conversar con pequeños chistes, historias y cosas por el estilo. 😊 No todos los accesorios son compatibles con Alexa, y además, no es tan fácil de utilizar como con el asistente de Google. Definitivamente, hay mucho que mejorar! 🎶📱 We bought this for my kid’s room. He loves to be able to listen to music and bedtime stories. He also likes to ask it 16,000 questions a day, which I love because it saves me from having to answer those 16,000 questions. I’m tired. Alexa helps. This is my toddler's best friend. Her enunciation of words have gotten extremely better since I purchased this. So much so that I have heard Barbie's Mermaid Party 564 times this month and that's just one of the 6 songs she has in heavy rotation. Alexa tells her the time as many times as she asks without frustration and I'm free to just let the hours bleed together again. If you have young, curious children, get this device! I love my Echo. Cute lavender color and the speaker is great compared to my other Alexa devices but smaller so easier to place around the home vs the older versions available. Easy to use and connects to WiFi seamlessly. Highly recommended. Great value for your money. I have to yell at it to get it to respond sometimes what is annoying. The sound is good as well as the response time. The hockey puck types that I have owned respond better than some of these newer models to include an echo dot (the ball) and this one.<br>Overall an ok buy..  Not sure about an upgrade unless you are going from a puck. The sound is much better for music and interaction. These little things are terrific !<br>I feel safer with a couple of them in addition to my echo dot. I can  make a phone call out to my daughter, or 911, etc if needed.<br>Great peace of mind as I’m getting older ! ! ! Love this speaker! It’s so cute, and it’s perfect for my bathroom while I’m getting ready! If you’re a bathroom singer and think that you’re the next Beyoncé or Kelly Clarkson, this is a great speaker! The acoustics in the bathroom + this speaker = chef’s kiss! 😘 However, (in my opinion) anywhere outside of an area like that, it’s def not loud enough to drown out the fact that I actually cannot sing. I have a Google Nest mini in my bedroom and it is noticeably louder than this speaker! Again, 10/10 for the bathroom superstar in me, just not so much for the rest of my house! We already have echos and echo dots but I wanted a few of these to place on my work desk, on the kitchen and in the guest room. They work perfect! Great price too! Sound on these little babies are WAY BETTER then I expected. I love this size option. Love that there are a ton of color options. I have it in the white and black so it blends in with the surroundings. Sound quality is loud and good for its size. Connected to WiFi without difficulty. I originally purchased as a gift for somebody special, however upon receiving this item I made immediate notice of the size when removing from the prepacked shipping container. And I must say I am overly impressed with the sound quality all the way around. I would be inclined to assume the usual less than desirable quality of \"noise\" in my opinion when making reference to any run of the mill small speaker of similar size and usability. Where I figured this would be a great add on to a already established series of assorted sized Amazon Alexa speakers coming together to form a beautiful chorus of melody and sound, but this tiny powerhouse actually is the rite find if looking to extend your Alexa assisted smart home system in effort to have a larger area of network coverage while also doubling as a WiFi signal extender or repeater to strengthen and progressively make your network coverage area much more vast in size. I have to admit I totally judged this item due to it's size and was happily surprised when I was carrying out all set up instructions that for a small room like an office or kitchen to a shelf in the laundry room or bathroom or garage / workshop area this is more than the rite quality and amount of sound needed for an applicable area. Similar speakers just out rite will never stand the test of time and for children this item is everything needed w it's capabilities and durable exterior. \"Only tumbled of the shelf or surface it was placed 3 times since Christmas\" and not one aspect was effected . Well crafted and more than sturdy and strong quality durable outer housing shell that protects the powerhouse that is hidden inside creating such an amazing sound . I have the dot now I have the pop. It's just as good as the dot I love them both I have two Alexa's and one Ziggy.. I named all three even the kids love them they have their own in bedroom I have one in living room and one in my bedroom Not sure why it took me so long to order this Amazon echo, but I now want one for every room! I use it mainly for music and Alexa just gets it! I never have to repeat myself and that’s nice bc Siri clearly takes our relationship for granted. She doesn’t listen to me, but Alexa does, and that’s why I 10/10 recommend this product! Is it better than my Dot? Yeah. Is it better than my Echo? Debatable. Is it better than my Klipsch stereo speakers? Not in the same universe..  After all, it's a tiny mono speaker, but at $19 it sounds fine. No real bottom end, upper end is a bit squished, muddy in the middle. Nothing an audiophile could gush over. Worth the price though. These Echo Pops work great for our patio. Allows us to listen to Sirius XM on the patio using voice control. We have them sitting on window ledges while plugged inside. We used two and have them paired for great stereo sound and just pull them inside during bad weather. Once it is set up for kids mode it's wonderful. It is too cute in my niece's bedroom and the color perfectly matches her beach-themed room. The entertainment value is unfathomable and had dancing and learning new things all-day for the month she was with us. Really good for the price, sound is not as strong as an echot dot, but still good, lows are better in my opinion, great for a small bedroom or even in the bathroom, but if you are looking for a strong sound maybe it is not the best option. We got this one for our daughter's room. Works great! She loves music at night, so this is good to instructbto playbmusic for a specific time. She also uses it to communicate around house and as an alarm. Great purchase, and her favorite color. Wasn't sure if i was going to like it , but i love it cause it has the drop in feature and i can use it with my kids. Alexa recognizes my voice and its connected my doorbell camera which is nice. Omg it was on sell for 19.99 I had to have it and it was worth every penny. I have 3 in my home and they are very easy to use. They actually allowed me to set it up before it arrived I love this lil speaker, I figured charcoal matches everything, but now contemplating purchasing an additional echo pop in lavender for the bedroom &amp; using the charcoal one in the bathroom or something. It's such a a great deal and excellent sound quality, ya just can't beat it.<br>I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the quality and volume of this echo pop. Unfortunately my home was robbed and the thieves had stolen my Echo Show &amp; one of my echo dots, I didn't have a lot of money to purchase another device, so with this being on sale 50% off, I decided to try it and I am glad I did. I think it actually sounds better than the show &amp; dot, although my show was an older generation but the dot was fairly new. Either way, I am very pleased with the quality of this device. It was super easy to set up and I am grateful that it automatically links to my account. Plus I am grateful to be able to completely deactivate the stolen devices so they can't be used or registered to anyone else. I purchased this to replace a very old echo DOT. The sound quality is a 3 but that's all I need in my office as I'm listening to podcasts or music at a low volume. There are also many smart devices in my office I voice control with Alexa and this device works great. I have a smart dimmer switch, 4 smart outlets, and a NEST thermostat. I'm on and off camera quite a bit and being able to set up groups and voice commands makes my day flow much easier. Oh and I picked this up for under $20 dollars :) Great little Alexa product! I put this in our small bedroom, and I am not kidding when it sounds like I put a big speaker in there when playing music !<br>The price was super affordable, and it is top-notch quality. Pre-setup at time of purchase made starting at home fast, almost without my interaction.<br>Tiny, fits most anywhere. Perfect for nesting in a book where its presence is only heard, not seen. Essentially the same as an Echo Dot, shaped differently. I thought this would be tinny on sound but added one to a room I have a pair of dots in and really improved the sound experience.<br><br>Its also more convenient to interact with touchwise.<br>I can definitely see placing these where you just want a lite utility interface or have absolutely no space, like my bathroom where I literally balance it on top of a plugin plug expander. I bought 3 of these when they were on sale. I use them in my shop for music- either Sirius XM or Amazon Music depending on my mood but the Amazon Music does seem to work better and be less glitchy. No more yelling in the house. It is easy to install and serves as a great intercom. My kids also love playing music on it. I didn’t realize how much I missed my Alexa until I was out of town! Cumple las expectativas. Tengo echo 4tha y echo dot de 5 y echo Pop lo único es que para cine en casa con el fire stick no es compatible ninguno entre ellos eso se pudiera mejorar para volver algo mucho más interactivo. This is a cheap speaker powered by Alexa. It sounds fine to me, just a decent speaker that gets the job done with playing music if you don't care about sound quality that much. It can get very loud as well. It works great as a alarm clock, especially if you wait to get it on sale for $15, and it is a easy way to control smart home applications like smart lightbulbs in a bedroom. I've had no issues with connections or the speaker not hearing me. It works great as a way to get Alexa into a small bedroom, especially a nightstand, or a bathroom since it's so cheap. I would recommend that if you want it as a alarm clock, I didn't get the echo dot with the time display since I have a old LED alarm clock that I keep on my nightstand to see the time, since it can be a full alarm clock then. It's a great cheap way to get Alexa into a room. This speaker was easy to set up, and it also linked to my Xfinity door bell which I did not expect that fun little feature! Also- I love the way I can just say “hey Alexa, set an alarm for whatever time” and it does it for me it does so many little handy tricks (but not using your hands) it’s amazing I greatly enjoy my Echo, it's small size isn't indicative of the huge sound that it puts out. It's a very good deal for the price paid, it setup for me easily, and I enjoy listening to music on it daily. Best of all, it's Alexa enabled. The sound quality is great and it's modern, good looks go well in any room. What REALLY sets this item apart is it's super easy setup. It's practically plug it in and play! Its excellent pricing makes it easy to own, too. Love the new echo pop. It’s a nice design and I like the color options they’ve added with this new model. I got the teal for my living room and the lavender for my bedroom. Both I got on a 50% off sale so that was nice. The option to set up before it even arrives was nice too because when you get it out of the box you just have to plug it in and go through a few short voice prompts and you’re good to go! Alexa is a fun addition to my house and she has endless uses. I didn’t think this would be as great as the echo dot but I was wrong. I LOVE this new Alexa for sure. The price I got this for was wonderful, I felt like it was a fair price. It was also easy to use as well. I was looking to put an Echo device in my garage just when the Pop was launched recently. I decided to try it since it was offered for only $17.99 and if my wi-fi reached my garage from my house, it was worth the gamble. (The price is now about $40) I was very surprised at just how great the sound was from such a small speaker. I have the original \"hockey puck\" Echo Dot in my kitchen that I use exclusively for my Amazon microwave oven and the Amazon wall clock but knowing just how terrible the sound is from that, I figured the Pop can't be worse. I also did not want to use one of my two original Echo Plus speakers (the tall ones they no longer offer, I wish Amazon would stop discontinuing items so frequently) nor did I want to pay for another Echo Studio since it is a garage with no heat or A/C (I am in Florida). The Pop does not sound as great as my Echo Studio but it is better than the original Echo Plus units that do sound very nice. It was well worth the very inexpensive price. I placed it on my tool box. The only drawback is it needs to be plugged in. A rechargeable internal battery would have convinced me to give it 5 stars. I also chose the lavender color since I did want it to be easily noticeable wherever I placed it (I am tired of black and white electronics). The Pop itself has a flat spot on the bottom that works just fine to place it anywhere. It also understands my commands easily with a mic that can be switched off using a button on the top. At the current price of $40 I would probably hesitate on the purchase. However, you will be satisfied at the performance of these whether you paid what I did or at the current price. It’s a good speaker, it helps me to turn off or on my fan, also I can connect it to my computer and it works, I can listen all music that I likes, and it has a pretty good sound. I used to listen to music on my phone while I was cooking or tooling around the kitchen/dining room area, but then this was on sale and I figured I'd give it a shot. It's been a lot of fun for the whole family. We take turns asking Alexa to play different songs, or asking trivia questions. I also like that she gives me updates about shipping notifications and I can add things to my shopping list. It looks very clean and feels durable. I don’t usually have an issue with connection, but sometimes it doesn’t accept action requests from the app. Easy to use and set up. Overall we love it, and we will definitely be buying more. UPDATE: OOPS. Problem was USER not DEVICE, working perfectly now that AMAZON so kindly called me to help me get back online. What did we do to fix it? I PLUGGED IT IN AGAIN AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY. Very embarrassing but very grateful to have her back and thank you again, AMAZON!!<br>ignore:<br>WORTHLESS!!!!!!! I GIVE UP. I CAN LIVE WITHOUT ALEXA! I have several of these already, and this one did not disappoint. Out of the box I plugged it in, and basically it said itself up.<br><br>It does exactly what it supposed to do. I’m pleased to death with it. POP Was an addition for the Bedroom, so I didn't have to scream at the office Alexa ... I renamed her to a him, changed voice to Australian to tell them apart by HEARING .... Wake word is \"Echo\" .... wish I could choose my own wake-word .... Amazon gives a choice of only 3 (Alexa, Echo, Computer) .... Not very creative<br><br>Speaker in Echo POP is amazingly Loud .... Surprised ... Purchased the mount too, so it's NOT on a dresser, Table, or in the way ... Very nice having 'him' on the wall only ... I DO NOT LIKE THE \"HALF DOT\" style<br><br>POP does connect to the Office Alexa for some things, but timers, well, depends which one you tell, as it's the only one will tell you after Alarms sounds .... That's NOT efficient ... You can set to where BOTH tell you, but then, playing music, sounds in both too .... Annoying if one person wants to sleep .... SETTINGS can be changed, but it's ALL or NOTHING scenario .... So I choose to keep them individuals for that reason .... Amazon could make a new update to fix that in the app<br><br>Would like to get one for the kitchen too, as I have some Automation for lights .... A coffee maker is on the list also, but will have to wait until I work a while longer, till payday .... Unit comes with electric cord, has BIG square head<br><br>. Pretty loud for a smaller speaker. Connecting to wifi was a little complicated due to it not having an action button. Linking services not to easy either. Woulr not buy again would rather just get an echo dot. Puedes reproducir musica desde Spotify o Amazon Music, puede ser complicado si hay distintos usuarios en cada con distintas alexas ya que pueden activarse bien todas a la vez. puedes pedirle chistes o otros modos de alexa, trate de conectarla a mi tv pero suena por bluetooth y no es muy bueno, mas alto sonara mi TV en realidad, aun no logro configurar bien que reconozca a mi lista de contactos con usuarios alexa para llamadas Got it for 20 bucks for my grandma with a sale and we like it way better than I thought we would. Quality is great and it is easy to use. I use alexa to help my grandma turn off the lights and use her smart TV easier. She mostly loves being able to listen to her music. Definitely worth the price! Even at the regular 40$ price I love that these are so small and yet so great. We put one in the garage where my husband does a lot of work and one in our master bedroom. We have the echo eight with Alexa in the kitchen. Alexa se ha convertido en parte importante de la familia, mis hijos se divierten interactuando con ella, le piden que cuente historias, que prendan  la luz, que pongan musica y radio; ayuda al despertarlos con las rutinas programables y las listas y recordatorios son útiles para los mas grandes de la casa, compraria estos articulos de nuevo sin dudarlo I really do like it, but I wish My Alexa pop had a big speaker because sometimes she doesn’t respond to me, and I have to yell at her and yes, I would recommend y’all to buy the new Alexa next time. I’m gonna save my money up and get the other Alexa where this screen on the Alexa and I can FaceTime some people. Let's get the dirty out of the way first<br>The sound is good although it could be a bit more louder and also because of its shape makes it a bit challenging to hang up on a wall without having to spend more for spaecal bra ket but the good side of it is that they make these anyway shape or form so imagine a Amazon Echo Chea Pet lol 😆 a speaker that grows ha ha ha so used my creativity to glue it into a tire that yes I can hang up on a wall or a tire rack but over all its a great product and I all the other Echos but like the pop and I like the dot because the dot will also fit into a tire without messy glue<br>Gee I wander if it's still eligible for return ?<br>At least not before I clean it up<br>Lol I owned the echo dot before and it was a bit more pricey for the same quality. The sound on this one might even be a little better. I believe I got this on sale too so even better! ! I bought one for myself. I like it a lot. The sound is surprisingly good. I bought one for my friend. She likes hers as much as I like mine. It’s much more user friendly than my Google device. I used to have the old flat dot from many years ago. The sound on the Pop is so much better; clearer and more crisp. Alexa and I have a great relationship. LOL!! Except when she suggests I spend even more money on those deals she keeps finding. Oh Alexa! You're such a bad influence. I purchased this product because of the sale price. I caught it when the price dropped. I have this in my bedroom. It works fine and can get to a pleasant volume. Sometimes when I demand Alexa to play or do something, she decides what she wants to do and I have to unplug her to show her who is boss. Other than that the purchase was a gold mine. Tried to use Blink Mini 2 cameras as external chimes for my Blink doorbell, but none of them worked. Hooked up the Amazon Echo Pop using the Alexa app and it's been working fine. Sound quality for this purpose is pretty good. Slightly more complicated than using the Blink cameras, but it was the only solution that worked for me. My mom bought a new refrigerator for her summer house that has Alexa equipped and when visiting, she loves being able to request any song she wants while dancing around the kitchen. Since we’ve all moved states away, we got her this Alexa for her apartment back home to use while she waits to visit again. It was cheap and compact and exactly what I was looking for. She loves it. Connects easily and works great, small and sleek little device I bought two of these in different colors to match the colors of the rooms I put them in. The units connected automatically to my existing Echo devices. I've used these to help make my home easier to live in independently as a disabled individual who lives alone. I also love the fact I was able to create a group of all my devices and when I play music, the music plays on every room that has a device. I ordered this to replace my old Alexa device. I used the old device often to play music, but the sound was awful. I stumbled across this echo pop and what a huge improvement, for being such a tiny speaker the sound is great. As a bonus, it was super easy to set up through my Alexa app &amp; basically added itself when I turned it on. A huge benefit when you’re not super tech savvy like me! This is a great Alexa product! If you’ve owned the echo dot before enough know the speaker is NOT good on it, this is sooo much better!! The sound is great so for the size it packs a punch. I got it half off and for the price I’ll make sure I have one in every room. Highly recommend The Alexa echo speaker is a most for anyone looking for a good quality product for a small apartment or room. I got mine for super cheap too, love Amazon's amazing deals. The sound quality is great too.\n",
