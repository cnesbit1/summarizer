      "No, this wouldn't be useful, anyway, and if the pilot wanted to make this happen, they can do it on their own.\n",
      "Can heat seeking missile hit the aircraft that launched it?\n",
      "We are just as aware of the ways to try and defeat missiles as pilots are (probably more so!)\n",
      "I am not aware of any that would respond like that because of an inbound missile though.\n",
      "A stealth fighter might not turn on their radar at all because doing so also gives away their location.\n",
      "Also in most combat scenarios, the missile will hit the engines.\n",

      "I don't think that's accurate either.\n",
      "The more advanced one certainly could.\n",
      "But normally the aircraft will have the option for all action to be pilot controlled.\n",
      "Long enough that the maneuver will result in him being shot down.\n",
      "You can dodge a missile, but you really need to have advanced warning.\n",
      "Depends on what countermeasure system the aircraft has on board.\n",
      "What this effectively means is that because the missile is chasing the target it doesnt need to turn as fast.\n",
      "That is not the only determining factor of if the missile can maneuver to hit.\n",
      "Future combat might not be like that.\n",
      "Does that put it in a situation where it can now out turn the aircraft?\n",
      "It's not like the plane can choose when the pilot wakes up.\n",

      "My issue of drones in war is the removal of the human life as a cost.\n",
      "none of the ones I worked on for F16 and F15 did and none of the pilots wanted one.\n",
      "Some aircraft are equipped with an automatic ground collison avoidance system.\n",
      "A pilot still has a better vantage point?\n",
      "You can tell what kind of radar is pointing at you based on that.\n",
      "It takes time on the magnitude of seconds.\n",
      "However I could see such a system as something that the pilot could initiate.\n",
      "The pilot or EWO could select manual or automatic dispensing.\n",
      "The decoys mimick the signature of the target aircraft.\n",
      "They also auto launch, so when you are comming off the carrier the pilot doesn't actually control the aircraft.\n",
      "It is possible to build a cruise missile that can targeted other aircraft, however, those will have a large RCS and could be shot down by an escorting fighter.\n",
      "You can tell when the pilot passes out based on his breathing.\n",
      "Flares interfere with heat seeking missiles.\n",
      "So I don't see why they couldn't also perform evasive maneuvers.\n",
      "Does this mean RWR won't pick up radars used in scan mode?\n",

      "4.\n",
      "That is exactly how it works, just in a different frequency.\n",
      "Imagine trying to evade 100 missiles at once.\n",
      "When the radar \"locks\" (switches from scan mode to tracking a single target), the RWR can tell and alerts the pilot.\n",
      "Computers are not smart enough to know how to counter an incoming missile with maneuver.\n",
      "However, I'm sure that would be classified.\n",
      "But it really makes sense that it is.\n",
      "This was in case the pilot blacked out due to high Gs.\n",
      "The F-4 was the first fighter that didn't have a gun, it was a disaster.\n",
      "The RWR (radar warning receiver) basically can \"see\" all radar that is being pointed at the aircraft.\n",
      "Radar off aircraft fires on the target having been data linked it's location by an AWACS hundreds of miles away.\n",
      "The airframe's performance can kill a human, but the computer wont let it.\n",
      "There is a big difference between blacking out and getting knocked out.\n",
      "Just having a RWR does not automatically mean a pilot has a clear picture of all radar activity in the area.\n",
      "The countermeasure to these will likely be towed decoys which are already available to combat aircraft.\n",
      "Certain frequencies are good for searching for a target but not good enough to guide a missile to hit a target.\n",
      "Depends on the frequency of the laser being used.\n",
      "When I was in Iraq, we had infrared based missile warning systems on our helicopters.\n",
      "The real problem here is not cost its the lead time training a new pilot and experience loss from losing the first one.\n",
      "Some modern fighters like the F16 and F/A18 trialed systems that would save the pilot from hitting the ground completely automatically.\n",
      "The only reason to use canons is when the enemy is within the minimum range of your missiles.\n",
      "Even the ones who know what they are talking about are still operating from armchairs ^_^\n",
      "Not sophisticated enough for target tracking.\n",
      "That's really cool, but IR is strangely not what I would think of in RF Radar.\n",
      "now imagine they're pointing the flashlight in your eyes and keeping it there as you move - that's track mode and what is called radar lock.\n",
      "Some aircraft however, can, if you want them too, start spewing out chaff and flares if the missile launch warning goes off.\n",
      "Also, pulling the chute totals the plane.\n",
      "This is detected by the RWR as a large, continuous radar waveform.\n",
      "AWACS continues to data link the missile until the seeker sees the target.\n",
      "They use systems like that on ships and vehicles.\n",
      "Even without the pilot to consider it is still much bigger and slower.\n",
      "I've read that some aircraft will automatically level out if they sense the controls are released.\n",
      "The missile has way greater thrust to weight ratio so its maneuverability and speed is much better than a fighter aircraft.\n",
      "The search radar is pulse and the tracker is CW (at least on the last system I worked on).\n",
      "Taking it a bit further, different radars operate on different frequencies.\n",
      "At that point, though, you might as well just build a combat drone.\n",
      "It can pick them up but the point is that it can detect the change in mode from scanning to tracking, and alert the pilot of the immediate danger.\n",
      "You could only use them if you bailed out of your plane while it was straight and level, as far as I remember.\n",
      "He might be out for seconds or minutes.\n",
      "There are some situations where the plane can take actions if the pilot is unresponsive for a short time, such as [AGCAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkZGL7RQBVw).\n",
      "The plane would be incapable of outmanuvering the missile anyway.\n",
      "Not even S-400 could pull that range off.\n",
      "The one above that thought specified fighter kills and of course a helicopter is not.\n",
      "I have no idea how this works with AESA systems since they scan ridiculously fast all the time.\n",
      "Not sure if anyone had mentioned this but there was a US jet shot down in I think was Bosnia by an anti aircraft gun with radar detection.\n",
      "The dispensing system was tied to the RWR system.\n",
      "Even if they couldn't reliably kill AWACS it would force them to evade and be less effective.\n",
