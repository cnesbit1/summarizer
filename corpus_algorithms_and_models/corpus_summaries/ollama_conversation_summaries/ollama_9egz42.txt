Here is the summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Lean back and whisper. You'll establish a dominant physical position

Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Throws people off

Decline to speak first. Makes them uncomfortable and puts you in control

"I invoke my rights against self incrimination".

If you can't convince them, confuse them.

You do not have to blurt out something on the spot - always gather your thoughts even if you instantaneously think of something, and speak deliberately.

I go into the interview with a very prepared and consistent story of who I am, why am I good at, what can I bring to the table, and what I am looking for. no matter how strange the question is, even if I give a slightly weak answer, as long as I tie it back to my core story - I should be able to leave an impression in the interviewer's mind.

I see, I always find myself in a panic to blurt answer immediately in interviews and presentations, gotta fix that up.
