Here is a summary of approximately 10% of the original text:

A) boyfriend has a form of ptsd from abuse as a kid, B) I have almost no sex drive, and C) every time I try to feel anything pleasurable, by myself or with him, I start sobbing uncontrollably.

Not happy crying, like child crying, overdramatic TV sobbing crying, and I can't stop it. It usually continues for up to half an hour afterward...

When I try to at least, yes. It never lasts long enough for me to actually get anywhere before the sobbing starts. It's more confusing than anything else.

I've done that, but after 7 years of all sexual encounters being focused on him, I've gotten bored with it. I get nothing out of it, so I've all but stopped trying to just please him.

It's not awful.
