Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

X1 Gible with the Adamant Nature and 6 perfect IVS
X3 Lapras with the sassy nature and 6 perfect IVS with all but 1 have water Absorb ability 
X10 Karrablast with 5 perfect IVS and the Brave Nature and all but 2 have the Shed skin ability 
X5 Gligar with the impish Nature and 3 out of the 5 of 4 prefect IVS and all have the Immunity ability 

All these Pokémon are a lot of them have 6 perfect IVs some only have 5 perfect IVs but the reason I rejected them are either because they don't have the gender I wanted Or the ability or some other reason but the Pokémon are legit and they are all at lv 1

That all of them all these Pokémon are legit and they are all at lv 1 and if you want any of them pm telling me and we can trade
