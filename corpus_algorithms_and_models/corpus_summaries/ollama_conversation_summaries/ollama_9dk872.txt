Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text:

So 60% of their cap can go to 4 players?
It did technically work, just not anymore
I mean the cap is gonna be 80m (close enough). Even Paying all four players 10 mil, that wouldn't equal 60%.
Most likely,
11 mil Tavares
11 mil Matthews
6.5 mil Nylander
7 mil Marner
Total of 35.5 Million or 44%

Let me know if you'd like me to summarize a different percentage of the text!
