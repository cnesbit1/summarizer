Let me preface this by saying that I haven't read the full text yet, but given that context I believe that makes perfect sense.

Given that energy is vibration within the various universal fields, and that matter is an interference pattern of these wave functions, it would seem to make sense that some frequencies are beneficial to the formation/continuity of life whereas others are detrimental through the process of harmony, be it resonance or dissonance.
