Here is a summary of the original text in about 10% of the words:

Wednesday: I cleaned out the freezer and found 18 pounds of meat left by my ex-roommates. I didn't know what to do with it, so I put it in the trash can.

Friday: I noticed several dozen flies around the house and realized that the trash had not been taken out yet.

Saturday: I decided to take the kitchen trash out, but when I opened the lid, I found hundreds of maggots inside. I was hesitant at first, but I managed to handle the situation.

Sunday: The maggots continued to multiply, and I finally called a pest control service to come and clean up the mess.

Monday: The pest control guy arrived and helped me get rid of the maggots. I was relieved that it was over.

TL;DR: I had a bad experience with maggots in my trash can and learned that bleach doesn't work well for killing them.
