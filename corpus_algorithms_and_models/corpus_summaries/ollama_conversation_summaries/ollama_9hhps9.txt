Here is the summary:

Have any of you seen the [Mueller emails](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1nu7SZvGCr5kZSG1MGj307Sj2uvHxwYHd) yet?

I'm still going through them, but so far they seem like the correspondence between the special counsel and the press.

And they were using Gmail

Maybe I'm missing your point but.. so?

Gmail with MFA is as secure as any other transmission across https. Nothing intrinsically insecure about Gmail except the user.

These emails are all formatted like outlook formats emails.

The emails are a .gov domain.
