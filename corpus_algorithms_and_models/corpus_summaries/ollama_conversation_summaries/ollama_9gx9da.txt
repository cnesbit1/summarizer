I don't see a reddit username in the article? How would that be considered doxxing?
Guess you didn't read the article. I'm not posting dude's name and reddit account together.
exposes a person's name connected to a reddit account. Last person that posted one a couple days ago from blp got banned. proceed at your own risk.
Yeah, should definitely be reported and removed.
The person in the article is trash and needs not be on reddit. The OP didnt post the name, it is on an external website. Semantics.

Not up to you. We are against doxxing here as it can be a reason to terminate this sub regardless of their beliefs since it has to do with sitewide rules.  Less than 5 days ago a similar case occurred and the thread was shutdown and OP was banned.
Thems be the reddit rules.

I had an account put my info up for sale earlier this week who just got nuked so this is 2.5 for the week so far.
That's fucked up too. I feel like there is going to continue to be a lot of this.
It's a shame that subreddits exist merely to harass other subreddits and users.

One of reddit's biggest mistakes.
Yeah I don't understand how that is allowed or at the least targeted harassment even if it is for their "entertainment".
