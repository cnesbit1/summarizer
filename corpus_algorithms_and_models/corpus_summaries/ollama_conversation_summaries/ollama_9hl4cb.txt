Here is the summary:

Canada Post needs to die. Job is a joke and for the rate of pay, incredibly high
If you want to place blame then look at the unions.  Canada Post provide pretty decent service.
Incredibly high.. you are going to top out at 60k and it takes almost 10 years to get there.
But should they make more? At its base, being a mail carrier is unskilled labour. Should unskilled labour expect to make lots and lots of money? I think they should make a living wage but not too much more.

Puralator and ups drivers make more for example.

When you factor in benefits and pensions I would bet that UPS and Purolator drivers make less. As well both of those are private companies. While I do care that their employees make a living wage, I don't care what they pay because it is not funded in part by tax revenue (although as of recent this hasn't been an issue as Canada Post remains in a surplus).

I don’t know what ups benefits. I do know that by 2020 they will be making almost $32 an hour.

In saying all that, I’m not even sure how good our benefits are. My wife says they are comparable to hers but I haven’t lived in Canada that long.

Canada post pays wages out of profits and they have been consistently profitable for a while now.

I agree there should be some sort of cap.. but I don’t think you would get people to do if that cap was 50k.

I’m saying this as someone who wants to transition into something else within the next 4 years.
