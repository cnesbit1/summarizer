Wow. I’ve heard of the phone calls but never actual letters. Pretty sure there are mail fraud laws that are usually taken more seriously than phone scams. Maybe that’s just in the US though.

Have you brought those letters to an accountant? I find it rather odd that the CRA doesn't know if your grandpa owes them money or not.

I told him to call the RCMP scam hotline about this.  He did and then he felt better.  I hope that more people report this when it happens.  We can overwhelm the RCMP with complaints until they complain to the government to get on this.

The CRA can't tell you if he owes money or Not? Look at the letters as they will always indicate an account number, sometimes fully visible or in the case of a SIN, it would be partially masked, unless a legal document like a garnishment.

If the taxpayer calls in and confirms identity then CRA will discuss the account. If the taxpayer isn’t capable, they can sign a T1013 for a family member to be authorized on their behalf.

Remember that this is confidential information. CRA takes that very seriously.

So then get authorized. It's a form or an online process.
