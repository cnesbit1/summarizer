If they keep it to 1-2 outdoor games, I can see the appeal of the outdoor games, but have more than 2 then you diluting the special meaning that the Outdoor game provides. I’m cool with the Outdoor games, but limit to 2 per season.

Never thought I would agree with a Colorado fan but I do. Once they started the stadium series I lost all interest in outdoor games. Limit it to 1 or 2 a year, and rotate all teams through, with no repeats until all teams get one game. Does not necessarily even need to be near a home team.

Yeah, part of what makes it a diluting factor is that you get the same teams in the outdoor games that there’s no variance of other teams in there.

I agree, and would like to add that they shouldnt have the Blackhawks playing the outdoor game every year. You want to give more teams a chance at the outdoor games, stop picking the same damn teams every year. Put in a little rotation.

I liked the stadium series at Yankee stadium, but that is mostly because it has a unique situation- 3 teams right there. Every team was technically a home team, and all the teams played each other for a game.
