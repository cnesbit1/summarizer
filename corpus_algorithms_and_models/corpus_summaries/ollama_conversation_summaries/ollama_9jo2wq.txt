I've heard similar things explaining why men who are homophobic have such a big problem with gay men. It's not so much that they mind two gay men doing consensual activities together. It's that they fear that a gay man might treat them the way they would treat a woman. It's okay (in their mind, not in reality) for them to treat a woman this way, but them being treated like that would be horrible.

Some people have an inherent disgust at the image of two men being sexual. This probably comes from the idea of imagining yourself in that situation, and is similar to thinking of other disgusting sexual practices, such as sex with an old person, child, bestiality, etc.

I'M NOT personally equating homosexuality with these things. I'm just saying that type of feeling is where some of the homophobia comes from.
