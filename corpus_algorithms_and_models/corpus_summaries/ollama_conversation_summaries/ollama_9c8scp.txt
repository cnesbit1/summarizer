Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

*God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.* [Genesis 1:26-27]
*"For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."* [Genesis 3:5]
*The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.* [Colossians 1:15]

Adam and Eve died for trying to become like God internally, and Jesus Christ died for trying to be like God externally.

They believed that liar who told them they weren't.
That liar is still making fools of gullible people.
