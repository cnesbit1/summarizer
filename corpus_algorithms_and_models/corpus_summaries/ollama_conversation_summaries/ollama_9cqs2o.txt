Unlike most of these posts this is happening as I write this.

Bit of background, I have been on medication for almost a month now for mental health issues and one of the side effects is insomnia. So I have had trouble sleeping and I am in high school so it takes a large toll on me.

I woke up this morning after 4 hours of sleep, and I have a maths test today and I am struggling to stay awake as is. So on my walk to school I figured I would stop by Woolies and buy an energy drink.

Almost at school now and I have downed 3 of them and I down another one om my way in. (Now I usually have these but not in such a large dosage).

I get in to class and my teacher doesnt mind me having a can in class so I drink away.
