Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Man this situation reminds me of the Flint team that walked out on the owner and GM. I get that that team is a junior team and this is a team of players getting paid big money to play but how long before the players are tired of the GM/Owner.

What did the clippers players do to their racist owner? I don't think they skipped a game, but there was talk of it.

The Senators players aren't going to do shit.

These situations arenâ€™t very similar.. I know a guy who was on that team. The team did that because the coaching staff was fired after a win against one of the best teams in the league.
