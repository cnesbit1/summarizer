Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

I don’t mean that in an “I don’t understand the context” way. I mean it in a why did God feel a need to put Job through what he did? Why did he feel like he needed to prove a point to Satan?

Luckily, Job isn't really meant to be read literally (cue the rustled jimmies)... It's a really interesting book which is composed of an older prose piece that surrounds a later piece of poetry. It explores the problem of evil, but never really gives an answer to the problem.

One thing though is that it does a great job addressing how we deal with people who are suffering. My seminary professor pointed out that in Job we have two main responses to Job's suffering. We have Job's wife who says "curse God and die" and we have Job's friends who spent most of the time telling Job that he must have done something wrong and that he deserved what he experienced.

Job's friends, on the other hand, defend their theology and in doing so abandon Job. They can't imagine their theological worldview being incorrect, so they throw Job under the bus in order to defend God.

What's interesting is at the end of the Book it is Job's friends, not Job's wife that God condemns.
