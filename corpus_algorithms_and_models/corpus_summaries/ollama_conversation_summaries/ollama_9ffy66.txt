Here is the extracted summary:

Lots of triangles in that frame. What a machine, lean and hungry, beautifully engineered, brutally powerful. A bike to dream of.
This is real engineering not some hairy chested engine with wheels. A bike to make the heart sing on a twisty road, not to burn impressive quarter-mile times.
"A bike to make the heart sing on a twisty road, not to burn impressive quarter-mile times like those idiot Chad-bikes. This is a REAL bike, that will protect your heart by all means necessary..."
Everybody knows the fewer your CCs the smaller your PP.
I've got a '92 750SS and you're right it's not the most powerful thing on the block. But the frame and the bike are the same size as a 250. So yeah, you really only need 66 horses, it flies and will keep up with a lot of modern stuff.
I'd like to know the weight. Power to weight is a bigger deal than outright power. A dirtbike can be a 40hp thrill with only 220 lbs to move
