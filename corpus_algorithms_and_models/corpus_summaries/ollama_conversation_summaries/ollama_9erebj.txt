I have been bullied a lot in the passed and it made me quite self conscious 

To the point where im not sure whether people are lying or not when they call me "sexy" or things like that

So, would you guys fuck a girl you dont find hot just to fuck?

I personally think it's healthier (emotionally, but physically much riskier) to have sex with many strangers then commit yourself to one fuck   buddy for this reason.

If he makes you feel like you're unimportant to him, that's a sign that this sexual relationship is not a good idea.

I'm sorry hun but as fuck buddies, you're both "using" each other. It sounds harsh when you say it that way but the truth is you go to each other for sex, no strings attached.

Are you saying you think questioning whether a guy is really into you is evidence of not being ready for a relationship?

I also bet good money that you're overly critical of you're own body, as we all are.
