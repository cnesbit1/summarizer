Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

RBI's PR offensive is going extremely well. At this rate, they will be among the top 10 poorest performing brands.

On another note, anyone else notice McDonald's is getting busier?

The McCafe near me is pretty impressive. They have an espresso machine and the menu is stock but complete. The prices are on par with McDonald's.

Tim's flirted with this. They made it happen.

If I wasn't also a Tim's to McDonald's convert, I'd be convinced there are shills plugging McDonald's in every thread. But yeah McDonald's coffee is legit, and I think it's the cheapest of the non-Tim's chains.

Plus the stickers and free coffees.

McD's app is also consistently broken for me. 3 times I've tried to place an order. Every time it sent to the wrong place, placed the wrong order, or failed to apply a coupon, *after* it charged my card.

It's a piece of crap.

...all that said, anecdotally, 3 of my family members also use the McD app and have had zero issues. So who knows.

I hope this summary meets your requirements! Let me know if you need anything else.
