Here are the selected sentences:

I don’t think I’ve ever seen a player leave a team in such a strange way.
The Kings were about to trade Richards to one of the Oilers/Flames.
It’s believed the Kings were offering two or three prospects (Jordan Weal likely among them) to the Calgary Flames and/or Edmonton Oilers as incentive to acquire him before the arrest.
Richards will have suitors should the time come.
Lombardi could have traded Richards away and let him be another team's cap issue but shut down trade talks because he didn't want to screw another team over.
The situation changed quickly. Richards’ name came up in trade talks over the weekend at the NHL draft, but according to ESPN, Kings general manager Dean Lombardi learned of an unspecified incident involving Richards and ended discussion.
Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli told ESPN that Lombardi “came right over to me. He pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is going to come out. I had no idea.’’’

It’s like selling a house, "Lombardi discovered a flood in the basement, making it seem like more an underground lake than a laundry room. So out of the goodness of his heart, he refused to sell his house at all"
What’s your issue with my post? I’d like to hear your thoughts if you have sources that contradict my post.
I don’t even understand the homer bias tbh.
Oh damn, you wrote a lot. I read it and you have some good points but I'm currently at Disneyland so I'll reply later. Can't spend all my time on my phone here
My issue with it? Your ‘sources’ don’t provide anything worthwhile or validate your points. Example: just because you have sources saying the Kings were close to a deal with Calgary/Edmonton, it doesn’t mean that it was called off because Lombardi was overflowing with “integrity and loyalty”.
