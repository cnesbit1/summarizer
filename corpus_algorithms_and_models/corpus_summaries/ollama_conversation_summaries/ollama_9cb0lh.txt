Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Today marks the second time I've seen a permastealth deadeye camping in towers and castles. Some people thought there was a bug when necro marks started going off but it was a deadeye maintaining stealth for long durations.

I don't like to complain about imbalance, but it's irritating when half the players in EBG are yelling at each other about whether the deadeye was still in inner castle or not (btw he still was, and yes, people drained castle supplies for stealth traps for this one thief).

What traits and utility skills do they use to maintain their permastealth? Do yall think this is a problem too or am I missing some counter-play or something (was playing mesmer spamming gs skill 5).

I get one shot by deadeyes constantly in PvP. Sometimes I manage to dodge that one skill, sometimes not. Yesterday I got hit by it with 35k damage and I'm just desperate at this point.

Well, if you were hit by 35k damage, you definitely took multiple three round bursts and let them build up malice. The good part is, at least against thief you lived that long, any other good ranged class would've killed you in that time.
