A dual front, regular bike with the famous inline 3 Yamaha engine (850 cc, 115 hp), even experienced riders think is extraordinary.
I am pumped to ride that one, since I recently took the new FZ 09 for a spin.
It's funny how anal people get about OEM's trying out new ideas.  I think that anything that creates more or unusual interest in powersports is a net win for the industry.

The good thing about these designs is the greatly reduced risk of head shake and better contact patch in the front, improving front-wheel(s) grip on the road (reducing the chance of the front end washing out from under you, which is hugely difficult to recover from on the street)
I'm just curious if you can slam on the brakes on a curve like you can with the can am spyders without issue.
Like I said, I recently took the FZ-09 out for a spin on my home turf and it was like riding a mountainbike with 115 hp.
