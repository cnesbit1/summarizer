Here is the summary:

My son 2.5 years old now. 2nd one coming soon.I don't feel that I can't do anything now that I could do before. If I want to travel with my wife I can just ask my mom to help take care of the kid for a week or 2.

For new parents (the trend I see among my friends) they lose their identity the moment they get their first child. They become just another parent who spends all their time on their kids, and flood photos of their kids on Instagram. I don't think this is healthy. It is still important to allocate some time for yourself to do hobbies you like. Some parents feel guilty for doing this, which shouldn't be the case at all. A happy parent raises happy kids. Like they say in airplane safety videos, "put on your own oxygen mask before assisting others."

The one thing I really miss is having zero interruptions during all my free time, to play games, watch movies etc.  Now I have to plan my time carefully to get these few hours of "me time" here and there. Still doable but takes effort.

Any tips on how you manage to not feel guilty?
