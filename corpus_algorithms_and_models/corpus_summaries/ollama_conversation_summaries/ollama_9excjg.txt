It depends on the girl. I have a higher sex drive than most guys I have dated. Some girls want it just as much as guys do. Some girls don't.

I either just ask for sex or initiate it or if they aren't feeling it I take care of myself. It hasn't caused any conflict in my relationships. And I personally don't think it's a hormonal imbalance situation, girls can like sex as much as guys.

Women with higher levels of testosterone have higher sex drives. It's why it's often advocated for a women to work out if she wants to raise her drive.

Yeah maybe the man could be having stressful days at work etc if he can't cope up with his gal in bed plus expecting performance daily from a guy is something I consider as too much.
