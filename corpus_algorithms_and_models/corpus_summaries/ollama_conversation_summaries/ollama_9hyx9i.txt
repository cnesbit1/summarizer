Here is the extracted summary:

Blue is incredibly vague and relying on readers to know his story. Not cringe if it's an honest mistake on Green's part.

But the poster also doesn't have to be friends with green on this forum.

I didn't know what he meant either, but I took a hint from the cryptic nature to look back at his timeline history and find out

They are friends in this case
