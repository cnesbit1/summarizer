Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Its like comparing a leopard vs a cricket, the cricket may move very quickly for a short burst but the leopard goes 80kmph
The F-16 is also 44 years old, at least on design.
Well exactly. 0-100 times, vs 0-400 times, will be, well, a little different.
Jets take a few seconds build up thrust so they'll lose off the line and I doubt most people could guess who would win in a drag race so it's interesting to see in action.
Leopards run at a max speed of around 40 mph. You're a bit off.

Jet engines also take a few to several seconds to spool up. And from the video it isn't clear if the pilot already has the engine ran up and is on the brakes, if he goes full throttle from idle it's no kidding a few seconds.
So? It can still go faster than either of the two that beat it, it's just not built for drag racing.

I hope this summary meets your requirements! Let me know if you need anything else.
