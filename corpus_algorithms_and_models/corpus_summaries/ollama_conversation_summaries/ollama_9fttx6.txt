Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Hey folks stop drinking pop.
It has zero nutritional value and does not quench thirst.
It is a garbage food.
[If you are overweight drink fucking water because diet pop will keep you fat.]

There’s a reason a soda comes in like a 40oz cup with unlimited free refills. Try drinking nearly as much water as people consume soda. You’ll be done with your water after the first cup

Does not quench thirst? How did you determine that?

I don't follow your reasoning. Just because people are addicted to sugar doesn't mean soda doesn't quench thirst.  Also, apparently you've never worked outside in the heat if you think people can't or don't want to drink a couple litres of water.

All I’m sayin is go to dinner with your friends/coworkers. Watch how much Coca Cola someone can consume in a short period of time in comparison to water.
