Here is the extracted summary:

Hey everybody, I'm new here. I've really recently been trying to have a living Dex in Ultra Moon, and I'm practically successful, but all I really need is a Hoopa! Can anybody here help me out? I got a bunch of shinies to trade if anyone's interested. Thanks!

Edit: got my Hoopa! Big thank you to jswizzl for the trade!

I have a few McDonalds Hoopas. OT: Mac, ID: 11275. Either Hasty or Modest nature. I self-obtained them directly from the event in Alpha Sapphire and reset the file for multiples.

Since it's an event I would want a 2:1 trade. I'm interested in the shiny Cacturne and Nuzleaf.

That's fine by me! I'll add you right now

Awesome, do you have a preference for nature?

Not at all, whichever works best for you is fine
