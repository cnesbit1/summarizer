I live in PA meaning it is pretty much impossible to ride during the winter, so I was wondering if i should take the MSF course before it gets super cold, or wait until the spring.
I took mine in the summer (southwest PA) and it was so annoying because you aren't moving much and just sweat constantly. Would have loved to take it in the winter. Go for it! 

Hell a couple years ago when I still had my ninja 250 I remember riding on Christmas day as it was about 60Â°
I remember that day also. Really awesome.
The perfect Christmas present!

We went out and shot slingshots at ornaments. Some of the ornaments that we didn't hit are still out there to this day.

No, that would be stupid :P
