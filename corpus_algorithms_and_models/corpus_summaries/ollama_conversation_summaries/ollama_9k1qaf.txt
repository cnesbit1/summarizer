Nothing against 377 or gays, but critically speaking, this letter is worded so broadly u could use it to support pedophiles.
How is sexual abuse consistent with compassion for others?
sorry but how do pedophiles spread care, compassion, and empathy?
It's saying that if you're a pedophile, you are still accepted as you are but you should strive for a life of compassion and empathy.

i dont know how people can conflate being gay to being a pedo. one just wants to love another consenting adult of the same sex, whilst one wants to love a minor.
The problem with pedophillia is the victims involved are at an impressionable age and are not mentally and sexually ready to engage in intercourse or even understand what they are giving consent for.

true. If they aren't using their urges as an excuse to hurt children, then of course they do deserve empathy and care.
