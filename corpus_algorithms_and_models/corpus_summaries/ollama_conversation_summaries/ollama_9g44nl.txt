So I guess I’ll start from the beginning. My mom left me and my dad when I was 3 years old to go live with another guy.

Then at age 14 I hit puberty and suddenly I was known as the ‘hottest girl in my grade’ and I was suddenly getting attention from guys everywhere I went, even guys much older than me.

I began having sex with different guys and I would just do anything guys would want me too. I couldn’t say no. I had no parental guidance to tell me what was right or wrong and I was just happy feeling loved even if it didn’t last very long.

As I turned 17 I’d done it all, even threesomes and let multiple guys fuck me at once.
