I'd buy me a KTM 390 or Enduro. Easy to maintain, high quality, distinct look, best thumpers in the market.
Honestly I agree. It's beyond me how they can't make a reliable thumper. Every other manufacturing has done it since the 90s.
Right? My RFS motor has been treating me well too. I don't get the hate for KTM's
Glad you got one that's not fucked.  I had the misfortune of working on several RC8's and a few dozen Superduke 1290's all of which seems to come completely fucked from the factory and KTM were the most difficult company to deal with.
I don't have one.
