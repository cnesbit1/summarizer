Meanwhile in Northern Ontario it's +28 feels like 33..

Too hot. I'm stuck in my underwear in front of a fan sweatin buckets in my appartment with no ac. Where do I move in Canada where it's always fall???

Perpetual fall.
West coast
Vancouver Island üëç That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going at least, after the BFE (Big Fucking Earthquake)

I'm considering booking a flight there now for a few days. This city looks right up my ally

" Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days), windiest (24.3 km/h (15.1 mph) average speed), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round.

"The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia."

Sounds fun
It's a blast.  Where else are you going to find hurricane strength blizzards?

Around 25C and 50% humidity. Just warm enough to be in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. Would be perfect all year round.

Oh no damn my poor education. Apologies my northern brethren
