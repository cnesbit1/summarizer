Here is the summary:

I rode back from Law School, around 10:30pm. I was riding in the middle lane of a 3 lane highway, doing the speed limit.

Almost out of nowhere, I notice this guy in a truck is speeding in the right lane. He proceeds to slow down, matches my speed, and tosses his cigarette out the window at me (went right by my face, but didn't hit me). I can guarantee it was intentional.

Iâ€™m a fairly new rider, and I just wanted to thank you for all of the previous posts about staying calm in these situations, and to not let anger allow you to do anything stupid.
