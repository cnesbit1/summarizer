I'll return sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* "Um no - I'm saying the big picture is what matters. We can worry about things on an individual scale as well."
* "Please explain why per person matters - and total output does not."
* "Ah there we go - I read some of your previous posts and wondered when you'd start barking like a teenager."
* "Good intentions? Jesus christ, they've only helped lower the cost of solar for everyone in the world. But hey, keep spouting out nonsense and make zero argument."
* "Again, what does that have to do with us? You're like the trailer park trash that complains about immigrants taking your job even though you've never had a job or tried to fucking look for one"
* "Take some responsible for your own actions for once, stop blaming it on everyone else."
* "Man I feel like it's mostly Albertan oil sands workers who have no other education and sit on Reddit during the day while everyone else re-educates themselves for a changing economic world."
* "Could spend the money training oil workers to become nuclear technicians, or something similar. Those other countries are gonna use oil anyway. I mean, we had a chance to industrialize, why can't they?"
* "When Nigeria becomes a first world country they may stop profucing oil too. We had 100 years to trash the environment. Aren't they just following our example?"
* "Doesn't the 'tar' in 'tar sands' give the impression that it's not the cleanest?"
* "You're right, it's true. So what do we do about climate change?"
* "How about a scholarly source lol. This isn't a grade 9 science report"
* "Yay more consumption. Take that paris agreement."
* "Sure I agree with those 2 points. Let’s also go after the ridiculous packaging in all consumer products. Again though - I do my part but sure as fuck don’t feel guilty about living my life from day to day."
* "Well that's up to the government to try and create some new sector or boost a sector of our economy to replace the natural resource part of the economy. That really would be the only way, other than that we would have to rely on a basic income in order to prevent poverty from rising to crazy numbers I would imagine."
* "I understand that it's awful that we have to affect the environment to continue our way of life but for the time being, but until we figure out a more environmentally friendly way of extracting, this is the way it will have to be unless everyone is OK with the economy crashing."
