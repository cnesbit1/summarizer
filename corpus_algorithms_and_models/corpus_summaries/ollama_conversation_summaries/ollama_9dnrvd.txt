Here is the extracted summary:

Why would a pair of handcuffs be contraband, especially a novelty pair such as these?

I'm wondering the same.
I do confess that I am a stupid American, but still.

Wondering this too! I keep a handcuff key sewn into the sweat band of my hat... Just in case.

Not a contraband *per se*, but a potential hazard to the flight crew. So any forbidden object that makes it past security could be considered contraband.

9/11

Got into bump keys after a while and ended up getting one of those big, fat 50+ key sets and an actual bump hammer and now I can get through 90% of locks in about 10 seconds flat.
