At least it's 5.56. 9mm, .45acp or 7.62 and you might have a problem

Care to explain? Those are typical munition calibres that both the SAF and SPF use.

Depends on what kind of 7.62. 7.62x39(AKM/SKS) means possible terrorism.

Pistols are easier to conceal, and therefore easier to smuggle.

It's unlikely it's from a patrolling officer since we use .38.

We have some 9mm handguns, but the .38 Taurus isn't phased out (completely) yet.

203mm is probably artillery shell.
20.3cm across so I'm sure you can imagine. It is a shell iirc.

Gpmg uses 7.62 tho so it might not be an akm
