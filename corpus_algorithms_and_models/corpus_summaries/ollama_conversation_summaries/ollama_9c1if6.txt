Just want to say, that's a lot of fucking paint and a lot of weight(32 lbs per sideish?). He was definitely sexist, but my jaw world totally drop if I saw that too.
I dead lift. I also sell a shit ton of paint and my uniform is really loose fitted so it hides my muscles.

Its always funny to disprove a stereotype. I need to get some goats so I can say my husband is at home with the kids.
Ya know goats are great for “mowing your yard”. That’s a practical reason to allow you to get them
And they taste better than any other meat if fed properly.
I'll run it by my apartment complex!

My boss does something similar. When we unload stuff from his car he tells me to get the light things. Usually I just grab two bags of 6 pack 1.5L cokes (so a total of 18 Litres) and he always goes “woah you strong.” 

Sheep are good for the yard. Goats are good for brush. OP could have her own landscaping business if she got both!

Deadlifts are the shit
How much you dead lift

That's not an OSHA approved weight... But it's SO worth it sometimes.

Yeah, more than the weight, I was thinking about those little cutty handles.  Ouch!  Hands of steel.

Hell yes girl! I lift too and I love see people’s faces when I walk around with my big bag of dog food over my shoulder.

I need to work with paint again.
It's a truck and it frames my pretext.
