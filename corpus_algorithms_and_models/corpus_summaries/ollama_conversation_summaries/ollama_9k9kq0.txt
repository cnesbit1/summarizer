Here is the extracted summary:

Given his history, anything less than 10 games would seem kinda low.

Shades of Matt Cooke here. Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless.

This isn’t the nfl. Keep your head up coming in the center of the ice.

Yeah and keep those eyes in the back of your head on the lookout too!

Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless.

This isn’t the NFL. If an NHL player is defenseless in the open ice it's their own fault.

The only time that the angle of a hit should decide if it's dirty is if it's from behind into the boards. Otherwise, keep your damn head on a swivel and think before you make a lateral cut into open ice and you'll never be defenseless.

If he didn’t catch his head and caught his body there would be nothing wrong with it.

The only reason this Jets player could be thought of as defenseless was because he decided to stare down at the puck instead of keeping track of what's going on around him, and there's no reason to penalize hits on unaware players and reward terrible offensive awareness.

That’s simply not true.

Humans do not have 360 degree vision. There will always be a blind side, no matter swivel-y your head is.

You are CLEARLY talking about something other than today's hit.

1st, it's a Blues player.

2nd, his head is clearly up
