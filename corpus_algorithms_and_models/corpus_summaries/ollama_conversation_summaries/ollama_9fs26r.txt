One of my biggest fears is getting pregnant,my boyfriend said he'll pull out but I'm still nervous that it won't be as safe as wearing a condom. To be honest I'm not even sure I'm 100% ready to have sex,but we've been together for a month and I'm scared that if I keep him waiting too long he'll lose interest in me.

No condom no sex. I bet he wouldn't want a baby too. And if he leaves you over that then it sure hurts but you deserve so much better.

You can also get pregnant from precum, although the chances of that happening are less likely:

&gt;However, an earlier ejaculation (either from sex, masturbation, etc.) may leave some leftover sperm in the urethra. This sperm can get flushed out by precum (aka, the precum would then contain sperm), and together would have a chance to cause pregnancy.

I don't want to make things negative, but there's also the chance that you all will break up *afterwards*. Do it on your own time, when you're ready, not as a bargaining chip to make sure he doesn't leave.

This. All of this. Don't let this guy trick you, the threat to your future is too great. I won't say not to have sex, but please use a condom until you're ready for kids.

Don’t do anything you’re not ready to do OP, he doesn’t care about you and it may not seem that way now but one day you’ll look back and understand that someone who truly loves and cares for you WILL NOT pressure you to do anything you don’t want to do.
