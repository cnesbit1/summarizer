I have a Marshadow OT: MT. Tensei, ID No. 100917, and Kalos Cap Pikachu OT: Ash, ID No. 011814, both are self redeemed.

Iâ€™m looking for a Jolly Groudon, with any IVs. And maybe a Modest Kyogre unless thatâ€™s too much, then just the Groudon is fine.

Just any Kyogre/groudon? Or the 2018 ones?

Okay I see you have both s/m idk if you also have us/um I can give you 4 codes they are still redeemable and you'd just have to reset for nature's would that be ok?

I have SM, but only UM.

Well 3 then and you'd be able to get lvl 60 of each and also lvl 100 groudon, the one you want more anyways ðŸ˜‹
