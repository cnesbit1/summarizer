Here is the extracted summary:

Alzner - Juulsen
Price

Honestly if kotkaniemi can stick and pot 50 points, and a few other key players bounce back, i dont think its entirely out of the question that montreal might be able to sneak into a wildcard spot. 
I believe in lineup depth. Gally will score with anybody.
Good point. May the Finnish Inquisition live on.
Fully agreed. They could definitely be a sleeper should Kotkaniemi stay up.
If price can be 2015 price they have a chance.
Plus you need a triggerman on that first line. Lekhonen fits that bill better then Gally, and he is an inversed winger in perfect position to shoot with a couple of guys feeding him.
