Hello, I'm looking for NA Gamestop Poipole codes distributed at gamestop from Sep. 17th. I can provide Yokohama Pikachu for codes.
If interested, please reply to me.

Of course, I've never used cloning, Save Managers and any glitches.
NOTE:
(1) Please don't send me any hacked, cloned or uncertain Pokemons such as 6IVs wild pokemon in Master ball even if it's for matching numbers.

This trade is not rush but I would like to get some codes until 3 days later from distribution date.
You can provide 2 XY/KG codes instead of 1 Poipole code(XY: up to 2, KG: up to 4)

Thank you for reading :)
Hello! Is it possible to reserve a Pikachu for 8 Poipole codes? That is, if you aren't in rush of getting the codes :)

This trade is not rush but that depends on the date you'll probably get codes. It's ok to take 1 week.
