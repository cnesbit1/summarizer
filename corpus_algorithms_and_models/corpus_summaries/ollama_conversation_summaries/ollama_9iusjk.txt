Here are the selected sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

All my life, my “technique” was basically to use two fingers to mimic a penis thrusting in and out.

**Here is what will literally drive your girl to the point of gyrating and dripping in your palms: fingering her with your middle finger, palm up, and simply rubbing her G-spot firmly (in pressure) but gently in speed in a CIRCULAR motion**.

**TLDR — It May sound like remedial school on sex, but there IS not only a “proper” way of fingering a girl, but a way to drive her nuts. Just firmly and smoothly rub her G-spot in a slow, firm circular motion, and let the good times (and her juices) flow**.

I have a vagina and that won't make me cum - sorry guy.
