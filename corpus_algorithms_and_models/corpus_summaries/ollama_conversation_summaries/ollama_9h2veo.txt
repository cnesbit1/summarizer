Here is the summary of about 10% of the text:

I could see Karlsson potentially scoring less. He won't have to shoulder as much of the load, and potentially not have to always log quite as many minutes.

Of course it could go the other way and things click and he lights it up, but just a thought.

Tough to score in the pacific too.

I'm thinking that adding EK affects Burns scoring more, but who knows. They could both get 25 mins a night and SJ forwards are good, so both d-men could go in the 60-70 range.

Brent Burns has put up 67, 76, 75, and 60 pts in the last 4 seasons in the Pacific. Karlsson will be able to do it.

It's tough to score in any division lol
