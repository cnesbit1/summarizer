Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* Sounded like /u/SuperTaiyaki had some good Japan riding experience if he cared to share his thoughts too?
* The Aragijima rice fields are [beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/DBDMKWL.jpg), but you have to catch them in September to see them at their peak. By the time you get there they'll be harvested.
* This is the best place to view them.
* There has been some road damage in Wakayama with the past few typhoons and resulting heavy rains.
* Definitely suggest hitting all of 371 down to Ryujin.
* I have ridden 3 different bikes here. A CB1000, two CB1300s, and my current bike is what you know as the FJ-09.
* Made an edit to my earlier post, be sure to check it out.
* Thank you so much for the advice, it's been extremely helpful.
* I have a good friend who rides the FJ-09, he's in love with that bike. A bit tall for my fit.
* Actually, I do have one thing to add. As far as I remember, after Mt. Koya there's very few places to get food, water or petrol except the Mt. Gomadan rest stop (the Gomadan sky tower, no petrol).
