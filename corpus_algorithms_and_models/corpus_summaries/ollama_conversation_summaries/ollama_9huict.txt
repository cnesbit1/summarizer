Here are the selected sentences from the original text, exactly as written:

With ride-hailing apps such as Tada, Filo, Ryde and GoJek emerging to compete for a slice of the pie after Uber's exit, consumers would once again enjoy discounts and promotions when these ride-hailing apps start to compete with each other to gain ground on market share.

However, we must not overlook the role drivers play in capturing market share for these companies in the "taxi" industry, therefore we can conclude that these ride-hailing companies would eventually roll out driver incentives to attract drivers to join their ranks. Example: Uber used to dish out incentives weekly for a certain number of trips clocked.

Let's assume an area say "Tampines" with a 10 minutes radius which coincides with Uber's narrative of waiting less than 10 minutes for a ride.

There is one hour left on the clock to the end of the week. Driver A needs 1 more ride to make 49 trips to collect his incentive. Driver B needs 20 more rides to make 49 trips to collect his incentive.

The ride should be assigned to the driver closest to the consumer.

With this opinion, I hope that the government would start an initiative to prevent these companies from designing their codes in a way that will infringe on the foundation of meritocracy, or even limit the use of such algorithms before drivers hit their incentives.

This has nothing to do with meritocracy. And meritocracy is not "work hard and be rewarded".

And it's just not that interesting an idea or opinion to publish in the Forum section.

It doesn’t just work in the one hour. It’s working every minute to artificially suppress the number of rides clocked by every driver.

What is meritocracy then?
