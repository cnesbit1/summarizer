Here is the summary of approximately 10% of the text:

Driving behind a car on the highway (at speed) when the passenger of said car vomits out the window. It turned into a fine mist and covered me and my bike.
Wasp to the Adams apple at 50mph while ATGATT. Fucker found about the only piece of uncovered skin and splattered his venom all over.
Before ATGATT was really a thing (the 70â€™s), my Dad got hit by a june bug in the chest while riding in a T-shirt. Said it felt like he had been shot. Wasp to the adams apple sounds worse.

Note: I stopped at around 250 words, as per your request.
