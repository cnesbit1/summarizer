* Jesus appears multiple times in the Old Testament and these appearances can be found in Genesis 3:8, Genesis 18, and elsewhere.
* The author believes that the Bible has reliable science, including the concept of "life in the blood" and the relative nature of time, which were understood thousands of years before modern scientific discoveries.
* The author also references the holographic principle and quantum physics to support their claims about the nature of reality and consciousness.
* The author notes that some people believe that most of the Old Testament was invented by writers under King Josiah to unite northern and southern Israel, but believes this is unlikely.
