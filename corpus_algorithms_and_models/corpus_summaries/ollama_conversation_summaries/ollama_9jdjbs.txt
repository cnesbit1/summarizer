Here is the extracted summary:

Honestly this entire preseason for the Sharks has felt more like using EK as a marketing gimmick as opposed to a team member. I understand he had to move, deal with documentation, etc, but they even brought him out during a game to showcase a new jersey. Seems sort of weird overall to me.
I mean, when the Burns beard has lost its fan appeal, they need something else to keep it going.
At a certain point, big acquisitions in the offseason are generally marketing gimmicks if you think about it. Most teams leverage it into ticket sales.

Plus Karlsson is the kind of player that can jump right back into NHL level hockey and take it in stride, he doesn't need the preseason to get back up to speed like some other guys, so it's better to give the ice time to some players that *might* make the team to give them a chance to prove themselves.
uhhh no. Big offseason acquisitions are to improve the team, not a marketing gimmick.

I guarantee the Leafs and the Leafs media have gotten a nice bump in $$$ since July 1st after getting Tavares

An externality is when a third party is affected by the actions of another party or transaction in which they have no say. Leafs revenue increasing as a result of signing Tavares is not an externality.

Karlsson being traded was a big deal because he's a star player. There's a certain novelty in seeing what he's up to on his new team (both for Sharks fans as well as basically everyone else, hence the massive upvotes on every Karlsson related post here). If we didn't trade for him, we probably would have just had Burns or Pavelski or Couture show off the new third jerseys during intermission and the vast majority of this subreddit wouldn't really care. But we have Karlsson and fans want to see him, so of course we're going to show him off a bit...

It worked for Ottawa last season

The whole point of improving the team is to make more money... Pro sports are a marketing gimmick
