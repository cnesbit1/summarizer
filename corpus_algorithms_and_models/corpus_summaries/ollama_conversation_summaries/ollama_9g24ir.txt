Five days ago, my fiancee and I decided to evacuate from a city directly on the coast of North Carolina with our two children, due to record storm surge predictions and possible flooding.

Two days ago was when everything got real. I won the N.C. educational lottery ($50,000) in a second chance drawing for scratch off cards that weren’t winners.

Awesome, right? Nope. The NCEL refuses to disburse winnings without a valid drivers license and social security card.

We are currently staying at my fiancée's mother’s house in VA, and currently have no plans on how to move forward.

I am thankful that we are safe. I am hoping that my friends and family who stayed in the path of Florence are all safe.

You seem to not really understand what it's like being poor, distracted and scared. Good for you.

OP admitted he fucked up, and he did, but it's pretty goddamn understandable compared to the people here fucking their couches and the like.

So where ever you’re at now, forgot, have a family member or friend with docs turn it in for you. If not find someone completely reliable to help like a church pastor, I dunno and shoot that person 10k for helping.

Not american here. why are you not supposed to carry your ss card with you? In my country we only have an official ID, driver's license is not accepted as ID
