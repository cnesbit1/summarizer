I am F 25, my SO is M 27. I have a way higher sex drive than he does, and I get frustrated when he doesn’t want sex when I do.
The problem is we live in a 1 bedroom apartment and we were both in bed, so I didn’t have anywhere to go and take care of my needs.
I don’t want to just whip out my vibrator in front of him when he says no, but I’m not sure how to get away to satisfy my self.
Also, we pretty much go to bed at the same time every day, so it’s hard to go to bed before he does to meet my needs.

&gt; is usually just because 1 partner isn’t finding the other that hot
Immediately assuming they don't want to have sex with you because they don't find you attractive will kill a relationship.
Different people have different sex drives, and even things like stress can cause someone's sex drive to vary.

Holy fuck this is some backwards 1950s misogynistic ass talking. Different sex drives exist, regardless of the person’s attractiveness.
Definitely not the case
