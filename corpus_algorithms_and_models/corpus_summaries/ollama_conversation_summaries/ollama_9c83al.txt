I bought a new ninja 400 this year. I did all the research into which bike I should get and watched all the youtube videos.

500 miles in I had a low-speed (fortunately) low-side crash that broke the fantasy I was living in.

These were the lies I told myself:
- I’m a responsible driver therefore I will be a responsible rider
- I won’t drop my bike so I can buy a new one
- I’m smarter than these other guys so I can ride hard without road experience

I drive my truck like an old woman on her way home from lunch on Sunday. But when I get on the bike I feel an irresistible urge that creeps in to go a little bit faster.

You are the biggest threat to your own safety. And the best antidote to over-confidence is constant honest self-assessment.

Good luck. Wear your gear.

Edit: You dont set out with reckless intentions*

It just happens. Pulling away from a light if I shift at 8-9K through 2nd I'm already going like 60.

You have to try to be dumb on a low cc bike like that.
