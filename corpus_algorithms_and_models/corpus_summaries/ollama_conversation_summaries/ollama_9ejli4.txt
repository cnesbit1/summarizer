Well, i first have to explain that my girlfriend and i dont have sex yet, we want to wait a little longer. But we do other stuff, one of them is grinding on eachother.

We are on the beach and we find a nice spot at the end where the rocks form a little harbor and its pretty shallow. Theres nobody in sight, so we decide to start making out in the water, she gets on top of me and we start grinding, everything feels good but his is where the fuck up happens.

I started tearing up. Shes screaming sorry from the shore as im trying not to drown and hoping the sharks have mercy on me.

I didnt even want to look at my penis because i feared the worse. Every movement hurt. Every ounce of pee hurt. It was horrible

Every step i take hurts. Every time i sit, it hurts, putting vaseline on it hurts, *looking* at it hurts! 

My grandpas birthday was today so we all went to red lobster, everyone was asking why im walking weird and i said that its because i have a rash. Technically not lying.  

I showed up to see if you somehow got your girlfriend pregnant. I was sorely disappointed.

Jesus christ mate.... You need to free yourself sexually.
