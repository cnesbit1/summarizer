Here is the summary:

Nice shot! What helmet are you using?

Thanks man! Nexx xr2 carbon I believe. Great helmet, super lightweight, slightly noisy though!

What do you think about your Nexx helmet? I use the X.D1 daily & it has many features for it's price(paid 180€) but the build quality isn't great. Many cheaper helmets have better quality.

All joking aside, you _really_ should wear earplugs. Even ignoring the hearing loss, it results in less fatigue, better focus, and honestly it's easier to hear the engine.

Trust me! Try it for one session and you'll see (hear?) the difference. I use the super-cheap foam ones: https://www.amazon.com/Hearos-5826-Ear-Plugs/dp/B00M0P6FX4

Give them a go. I was surprised how good they are especially on the street. You expect them to kill all sound, but really they're more like bullshit filters. All the sounds I needed to hear without so much of the wind and road noise.

I find that I'm able to hear the engine of my bike and other vehicles better with earplugs.

Try 'em! It makes a HUGE difference.

It’s is noisy, not unbearably, but definitely noticeable when travelling over 60mph. However that is the only bad thing I can say about it
