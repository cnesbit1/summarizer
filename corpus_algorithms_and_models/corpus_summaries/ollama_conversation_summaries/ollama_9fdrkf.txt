Well, blame it on iPhone X.

It was so much more popular and expensive than 8 last year. Apple might have saw the opportunity that people are still willing to pay a high price for iPhone. Hence the increase in price this year.

I like apple but even i feel this new pricing for 512Gb is abit crazy. And the Iphone Xr being their “budget” phone , starting at 1249.

Not flaming. But In the first place do you even need so much space for your phone? LOL.

I always go for the lowest capacity. 64Gb is more than enough IMO.

You can't put the words, apple and budget, together like ever.
