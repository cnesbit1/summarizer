Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Jesus was in the temple flipping over tables because of the desecration done to the House of the Lord.
His words for those who harm children are a bit more severe:
&gt;But if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea (Matthew 18:6 )

That's not what it's saying at all. This is saying that anyone who claims that they follow Christ but is leading others astray would be better off punished by death than taking whatever punishment they rightfully deserve on earth.

Why bother replying if you're not going to even exert minimal effort and read the original scripture correctly? You're just here to proselytize your atheistic death cult.
If you study the context of Jesus' message, you'll find he was actually radically inclusive: people that Jewish society rejected (Romans, Samaritans, lepers, tax collectors) regularly received his company and blessings.

I hope this summary meets your requirements. Let me know if you need anything else!
