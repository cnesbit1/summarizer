Here is the summary of about 10% of the text or up to 250 words:

Cost my American girlfriend something like $700 to get her birth control filled on insurance.
Then she has shitty insurance.
A month or per year?
Two months I believe
We paid $66 for 3 months of my wifes birth control. This is entirely out of pocket.
&gt;The cost for Seasonique oral tablet biphasic extended cycle is around $742 for a supply of 182, depending on the pharmacy you visit.
And I would say then that her parents, despite being doctors, are not buying great insurance.
In the US I have a top notch PPO plan, my wife pays less than that per year for birth control under the plan.
Your wife could be taking cheaper birth control.
I have a company that operates on both sides of the border...
best of luck to you
Thanks buddy
