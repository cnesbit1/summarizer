Here is the extracted summary:

When I was maybe 10 I wrote a letter to Jean Chretien demanding that kids be given the right to vote because the charter doesn't say anything about a voting age, it only says that all citizens can vote.

I got a letter just like this answering none of my questions and responding to none of my arguments and I was just about as pissed off as I've ever been.

If kids could vote, that sponge Bob would be in charge

I had the same experience. I remember being so incredibly annoyed at the form letter and a signed photo.

Why in the world would I ever want a photo of Chretien? I just wanted my opinions taken seriously. 10 year old me is still pissed off.

If adults could vote Donald Trump would be the President of the United States.

... yep it checks out.
