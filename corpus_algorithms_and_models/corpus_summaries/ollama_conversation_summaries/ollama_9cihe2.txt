Here is the summary:

I believe it, and agree with it. Assault rifles too (and yes I know they are heavily restricted already, but seriously,  outside of military and assault teams, what argument does anyone have beyond "I like guns!!" )...

Assault rifles are not "heavily restricted", they're illegal. They have been for decades.

What category is an AR-15 in? I understand it's not considered an assault rifle by those in the know. But whatever category it belongs in, I support banning that category as well.

Its a small caliber semi auto rifle, basically comparable(although considerably lower powered ) to many rifles that have been ubiquitous as hunting tools in canada for decades.

I live in a free country and shouldn't have to justify why I 'need' something if I want to have it, and have met all legal criteria for it.
