Here is the summary:

The most stupid part of the original pizza gate story (i think people have tried to use pizza gate for any high powered pedo people in USA) is that some how its only Democrats. Yeah a group of politicians get together to run a pedo ring out of a pizza shop but then say its only for Democrats.

I'm fairly conservative and I completely agree with you. I guarantee if you dug through McCains emails there is some egregious stuff.

Definitely McCains. He's the pizza maker isn't he? /s

Why McCain & not Trump? IDK if McCain ever hung out with Epstein.

Trump isn't really a Republican/Conservative. He disagrees with a TON of stuff the career Republican politicians stand for, which is a good thing.

Couldn't agree more. The idea, for example, that the Podestas look like creeps to support the conspiracy is rediculous.

Anyone who frequently spent time with Epstein is heavily suspect IMO.

John Podesta stated in his emails he was close with Dennis Hastert.

Fuck I had no idea Trump hung out with Epstein. You just blew my mind. I give up man! All of the people capable of generating enough money to campaign for office at that level turn out to be sick evil deviants. Even if Trump didn't partake. Guilty by association.

I only say this because this conspiracy is so one side when diving for evidence. You don't even need leaked emails to find trump discussing younger girls in relation to a future underage sex offender.

If you're trying to control politics through pedophile blackmail then your not going to focus on just one side of the house.
