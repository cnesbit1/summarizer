Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I don’t know if you’ll ever see this, but last night I had a panic attack at a party I’d gone to and ended up separated from my friends, sitting on the curb outside the house.

Eventually, this group of three women sat down by me and asked if everything was ok. I, a drunken blubbery mess, said no and continued crying. One of them held me and said everything would be ok while another tried to get information about the guy I came with so they could help me find him.

Here's a question for you ladies. I'm male, 69, a beard and ponytail (graying). I saw a girl (18-20 yrs) sitting against a tree in front of a frat house at our local college. She was disheveled, crying, and in obvious distress at 3 AM.

Honestly what you did was great. Maybe return with campus security.

I'm sorry, thank you for showing empathy
