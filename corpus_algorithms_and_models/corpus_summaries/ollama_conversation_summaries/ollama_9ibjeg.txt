We missed the greatest production of the modern era because of Crosby's concussions. He was on pace for ~130 points in two seasons in a row and he was injured in all of them. Not to mention his 2012-2013 season where he would have recorded 70+ points in 48 games.

HE PUT UP 159 IN 99 GAMES BETWEEN 2010 and 2013. That's a 132 point pace whether you take his first 82 games or his last 82 games out of that 99 game stretch.

I'm with you on that. If Crosby had never had concussion issue I can't even imagine where his points would be right now. We were robbed.

Oh god. I just had a horrible realization. Right now, when anyone mentions anything Gretzky did, there will always be one Pens fan screaming about "but Lemieux's injuries!!!".

Iâ€™ll never forget the night he came back

He was also on pace 3 years in a row for 130 points between 2010 and 2013. That's a 99 game stretch, not a 41 game stretch. Which is longer than a season by almost 20 games.
