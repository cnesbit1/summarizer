Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

It seems like the usual one hasn’t been made so I’m just going to post this one?  I don’t have a fancy template like the normal one though, sorry

I’m not trolling, I have been enjoying the game even though we are getting our asses kicked. Just saying you guys haven’t been objective at all and are being pretty insufferable.

you can talk shit about the team/fans for 10 years or you can complain when they're good, but ya can't do both

I mean it's r/hockey not r/Leafs he (or she) has just as much of the right to be here as you do. Am I agreeing with them? No, but they still have the right to be here and to not be told to get the fuck out.

Yeah fuck Leafs fans for being happy about how good their team is after a decade + of being one of the worst in the league. Fuck them.

They're hyped about their team, man. Kinda sucks sometimes, but I get it.

I really never did, we were in the West for most of the time they sucked anyways. They weren’t on my mind at all.

Cool ? I’m not talking about the outcome of the game tho.

If the score were reversed I'm sure the tables would be just as turned.
