Here are the extracted sentences:

* Like anorexia or alcoholism or shortsightedness. It's something you can't help being, and yes, it's a result of the fall, but the person stuck with it isn't evil for being stuck with it!
* Saying once, 'I believe homosexual acts are sinful' and then dropping the subject isn't harassment.
* Things I think u/Caddan's phrasing did better than 'love the sinner, hate the sin':
	+ It got over the 'yes, this is an abomination' right quick (without leaving it out!) and moved on to words that actually make the person feel loved and accepted as a person.
	+ People tend to remember all of what you said, but carry away the feelings generated by the tail end of it. u/Caddan's phrasing put the loving words at the end.
* It refers to the target as 'people'. If you (hypothetical you - the person using the phrase) refer to straight people/Christian people/thin people/nice people as 'sinners' as a matter of habit, calling LGBT people 'sinners' is fine.
* I love them, and I will always love them. Heck, when my younger brother was called a faggot, I went all mama bear on that little punk.
* God knows my siblings hearts better than I do, and for all I know they’ll be accepted into heaven and I won’t!
* They are involved in their communities, and...heck even do more humanitarian work than I do! 
* I think a lot of Christians approach homosexuals with good intentions, but it’s honestly a very fine line between being accepting and being bigoted.
* As the good book says, “Love thy neighbor….”
