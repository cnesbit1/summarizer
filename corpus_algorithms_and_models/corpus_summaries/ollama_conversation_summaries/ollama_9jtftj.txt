Here is the summary:

Kav has supported so many Bush era spying and detaining policies throughout his career. I probably don't need to tell you that.

He's a Bush Era, Jesuit taught, Anti-Constitutionalist, who was a member of a sex-cult fraternity catering to the 1%... A real r/conspiracy nightmare

I genuinely like AJ, I don't think he's fake or a CIA asset or anything. I think he got excited that he might actually win with trump, and cant let it go.

Alex Jones has lost his fucking mind, dude. Just the other day infowars was calling for actual martial law.

Can you explain the Jesuit thing please?

I'm sorry, but this a pathetic and biased opinion. Why didn't they just vote to confirm him like normal.

Even Bill Cooper warned against believing Alex Jones.

He went to a catholic school growing up, the sect of catholicism was Jesuit.

Pope Francis is a Jesuit.

Thanks!
