Why does an adventure bike have dual Brembo Monobloc Calipers
Because that money would be better somewhere else. Suspension, etc... or a lower price tag.
I donâ€™t think they are mono blocks. I think they are the same Brembo I have in my 1090 adventure R. And they suck ass. Really the only bad thing about the bike.

What do you expect Guzzi to do? They used brembo practically since they started making brake parts, and they generally stick with Italian components on all their bikes, which is definitely cool and not very common in modern world.
I get many people here can't understand why this set up is bad, but thanks for your reply. Best of luck finding a solution to your issues with it.

I undestand why I spend less time posting here... get downvoted for mentioning an ADV with monobloc radial calipers being silly set up.
They are just too strong to use with semi knobby type tires. Simple as that.
