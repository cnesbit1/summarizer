your only 25 my man, which in my opinion is way too young to be married to begin with.
They are statistics for a reason - it’s a common occurrence, nothing to feel ashamed of. Better that it happens now rather than when you’re 35 or 45. Make a clean break, spend a bit of time recovering and getting to know yourself as a single adult, then get back out there.
Very true.
I got married at 20. I'm still married to her with 3 children. Both of us have been faithful to the other. It's respect, communication, compromise and most importantly unconditional love and understanding. In my marriage, those are the ingredients for our success so far.
It's sounds cliche, but she really does make me a better person.
