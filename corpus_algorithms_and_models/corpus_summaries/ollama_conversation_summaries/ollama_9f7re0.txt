Here is the extracted summary:

Hey guys. I’ve been trying to get my Ninja back up and running ever since the fuel seal went bad and got water in the engine.

The battery is at 100%, I went over all of the electrical systems on the bike with a multimeter and checked the fuses (all is well), and replaced the oil and oil filter.

Where would you start checking first if you were me? Spark plugs maybe?

Water may have damaged your injectors.
That’s kinda terrifying. How would I diagnose that if it was the case?

U could start by pulling the spark plugs and crank it over. Don't smoke while u do it.

Yeah definitely changed out the gas... but I didn’t flush the fuel lines. My pump wasn’t working.

I doubt it but you can tell easy enough when u take them out. Might wanna clean the residue off them with some carb cleaner and a wire brush while they're out though.

If you were a betting man, would you guess that’s the issue?

U can tell easy enough by the smell of what gas comes out at the cylinder. Bad gas smells kinda like kerosene.

Yeah I didn't consider spark plugs could be hard to get to. Mine are super easy sitting out in the open.

Nope. Harley motors real easy to work on.
