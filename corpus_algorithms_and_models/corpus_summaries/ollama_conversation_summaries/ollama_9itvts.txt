Exactly. This is a brilliant move by Duchene: he wants out, so he gives them a perfect excuse.

But that only gets him out by next summer!

Lol, what is management going to do? They should be sucking Duchene's balls right now trying to give him a reason to re-sign.

God, that lineup looks so bleak when you take Duchene and Stone away from it.

I hope he has to walk by a large poster of Subban on NHL 19 every day.

They can suck all they want, but no one in the right mind is going to be re-signing with this team under the current ownership and management.

Unfortunately and hopefully for not too much longer

.....a very badly hurt old boi.

This just in, Chabot, Stone and Tkachuk placed on waivers to get rid of all the "bad seeds"
