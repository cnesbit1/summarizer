So illegal immigrants get an all expenses paid stay here in Canada while their claims are processed, but we can't even properly look after our veterans? Makes me sick.

Those illegal immigrants shouldn't be ahead of anyone in line for government funds. Even more insulting, most of them are found to have had legal status in the Us, further proving that the bulk of them are merely asylum shoppers

It's not either-or, but when's the last time you heard conservatives saying we needed to do more for the poor and homeless except when complaining about refugees?

If the anti-refugee people weren't the same people always cutting social programs that help the homeless, maybe I'd care what they thought of money we could be spending on the homeless.

It doesn't matter if they look shady or not, their argument is either valid or not.

Because it's a stupid argument. Vets do get money. The amount spent on refugees is insignificant compared to vets.

Not enough to cover their needs. They are even denied service dogs.

No it isn't. The Federal government alone has spent over $120 million on illegal crossers, that would go along way towards meeting Vets' needs.
