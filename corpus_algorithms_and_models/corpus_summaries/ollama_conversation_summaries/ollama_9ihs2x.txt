For the better part of a year my mom has been excited about seeing this man who's name I won't share at this time. He claims to heal people in the name of God and has a huge church in Nigeria.

What should I do?

I should also say that I do believe is spirits and demons and don't want to put myself in a position to be possessed by an unholy entity.

UPDATE:
My mother is much more ill than she has let on. She struggles daily from past medical procedures along WITH diabetes. She is literally so desperate and I'm so much that she doesn't care whether she dies during the trip. She's convinced that she will be healed by her faith.

I'm fearful that I won't have a mother at the end of all of this.
This man will also try to take her money. Plain and simple.

It is a legitimate church in that it is a true organization not just a guy in his living room.

Legitimacy does not protect you. Period.

Would you believe yourself to be a tad biased on this matter, being skeptical of the existence of a higher power (my understanding of atheism)?
