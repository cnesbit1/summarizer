I know Singaporeans love saying complaining is a national pastime, but I disagree with the notion that it's a defining trait of Singaporeans. It's more a defining trait of anyone with a phone.

As a foreigner myself, I find the social media comments from my home country (India) in news posts way worse than what I see here in Singapore. The sheer amount of pettiness, whininess, stupidity and negativity is staggering. And in multiple languages too.

That said, what with the comments from Nas Daily, and how Singaporeans are getting a lot of flak for being whiny in the comments, is the "whiny Singaporean" perception really accurate? Local Singaporeans who haven't lived outside (traveling doesn't really count, imho) would definitely say it's true, but as with any local population with limited exposure to bread-and-butter issues of other countries, it's easy to assume any common behaviour as uniquely Singaporean.

Can confirm, went for a stint in London. Met some sg, Malaysians and Filipinos people there. More often that not, sg really look down on sg while saying how much better London is in comparison.

Online is one thing, but face to face, yea sgs are the worst compared to the British.
