Wouldn't you have a pretty good chance of falling off if you hit the dog though? I can see that logic for like a squirrel or groundhog, but it seems like you'd be better off trying to stop than hit something that large.
Well, yes and no. There is no time to plan those things in situations like that. The basic instinct should always be to take as much speed off as possible by doing a controlled emergency stop.

You chose to be stupid
Its a tougher decision on a bike as even a medium size dog would be enough to take the bike out.  In a car its a little more cut and dry.  Im not risking swerving into another lane and hitting someone else or going into the ditch for any animal.
I ran over a groundhog that came running out of nowhere this summer... maybe 30/40mph, it felt like a really small bump with no deflection or anything.

What really should have happened is the asshole with the dog should have his silly ass dog on a leash, especially since it apparently doesn't fear traffic...

When I was in my MSF class they mentioned a story where a Honda Goldwing cut a deer in half because he hit the throttle a little to lighten the front going pretty fast, kept the bike upright i guess.
