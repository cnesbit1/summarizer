Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Don’t. You’ll end up hating yourself. Your body, your everything. You’ll think you’re stained and worthless. But if you are going to. Use a condom. But please don’t.

Uh, I didn’t say someone “should” feel awful, proselytism is an interesting word to pick for it. I’ve just known several women (honestly both genders but mostly women) who did the same thing, some in an attempt to “regain control” of their bodies after some sexual abuse, others as a way of getting back at their ex’s, and I see the consistent pattern that at the end of these sexual binges. They hate themselves, call themselves stained and ruined...

Live your life and enjoy yourself but please don’t use your body as a tool. That’s all. It’s worth more and so are you but if this is your choice then so be it I support your ability to make it, regardless of my personal feelings on the matter.

I think I understand your confusion but yea, not what I said or meant.
