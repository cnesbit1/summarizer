I'm not his property.

So instead you’d wanna have a random stranger grabbing your ass as you’re trying to enjoy yourself and have your boyfriend just stand there sipping his beer?

I'd handle the situation myself first and if that's not helping, I'd expect my boyfriend or girlfriends to stand by me, not for my bf to attack someone out of blue.

Yes and I handle my own bullshit. I don't need my boyfriend sorting it out for me. That situation is patronizing.

Oh, okay, so it would be fine if his girl did the punching. Well... eh, I guess that's okay. At least better than the extreme retardation in the other comments.

You don’t need your boyfriend sorting it for you huh? So what would you want me as your bf to do then?

For the record, this is absolutely not the case. People never rush to your aid when being sexually assaulted in public.

I have. I walked away with a friend (it was a girl's night out) and told security, and they took care of it.

If my life was in danger I’d expect my boyfriend to react. If I was in a situation I could react to myself, I’d want to do that.
