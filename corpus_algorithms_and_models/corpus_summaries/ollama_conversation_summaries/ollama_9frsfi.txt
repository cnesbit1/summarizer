She took a key from under a rock and I didn't think anything of it, people forget their keys sometimes.  I met her at a club. I didn't get her number.
Do you even know her name? Probably not her real one...
That is the last thing that I would do.  I don't know if she stole anything. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything, or arrested for being an involuntary burglar.

Bruh, fucking go down there, explain the situation, ask for your wallet back, and call the cops. Easy. It's the responsible thing to do.
I agree, it's better if he calls the cops otherwise he won't have a chance of proving he is not guilty.

What and get shot ?
You’re going to get accused of stealing or burglaring if you don’t go downstairs right now and explain what happened and make yourself known.
