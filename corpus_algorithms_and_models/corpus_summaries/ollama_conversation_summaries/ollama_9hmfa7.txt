I can only type this now, weeks after the mistake. The skin was peeling on my hands, and though it didnâ€™t hurt, it was quite annoying. It looked horrible as well.

The brilliant idea came to use callous remover (it removes dead skin, right?) to take off the outer layer that was falling off.

It worked... in a sense. I put the callous remover in latex gloves, rubbed it around to distribute it around, then put my hands in. I planned to leave them in for 5 minutes. After about 1 minute, a searing pain began to shoot up my arms.

The callous remover did its job, removing a layer or two of skin. My hands would no longer be peeling. The problem was that every small crevice in my hand, every wrinkle, and every groove deeper than a fingerprint ridge began to bleed.
