Sometimes I can go forever and have to mentally try to orgasm.  Other times I can barely last 2 minutes and have to bite my own fingers to distract myself.

I think it depends on a lot of factors but i dont think women understand what they can do to a man. Thats why not matter what, i always go strong on foreplay.

For me it's mostly stress related. If you focus and control your breathing you can pretty much go for 30 minutes easily. Also people when they're about to orgasm tense up their muscles. You can try just relaxing your whole body.

I read on here once that if you go pee before scrumping, you'll last longer.  So I tried it, and it actually worked.

Sometimes he's more sensitive than others, sometimes more aroused mentally ahead of time, sometimes he can go for what feels like ages and is multiorgasmic, other times he's one and done over the course of, like, 10 minutes.

I think it has to do with the fact that the muscles you tense to stop yourself from peeing are right in there with the muscles that tense as you near orgasm. So it stands to reason that if those are already tense from having to pee, you'll come quicker, and vice versa.

Pee before sex, that will make you last longer
