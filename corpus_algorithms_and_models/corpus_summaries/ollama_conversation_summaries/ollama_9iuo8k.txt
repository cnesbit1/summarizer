Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Administrators have to do this when public funding for school keeps dwindling, and schools have to compete against each other for funding via student outcomes.

It's a shame.
S j w parents as well go in and depend ridiculous changes like participation trophies, banning kickball, and pretend softball practice. I shit you not, the girl I'm dating took her twin sisters daughter to softball practice and it was done with pretend balls/bats so that no one gets hurt

I mean, the federal budget for education was 3% last time I checked. Military? 48%, and that doesnâ€™t include any ongoing wars (war on terror since 2001, etc.).

Not handing anything in is on the parents and the administration in charge.
