Last night I was a friend’s house and we were eating merengue cookies. We were commenting that they tasted like dehydrated cereal marshmallows and I said “why don’t they sell bags of those?!” Well it turns out they do and Amazon and FB were creepy enough to let me know. This isn’t new information but always worth mentioning, I think.

I don’t have FB app on my phone. I always log out of FB. Have the prime video app only.

If you've visited Google or Facebook on that instance, they use tracking to track you from site to site.

Android is Google’s operating system so if you have a droid there is no way around that one...

I think just turn off permissions to your microphone? I have an iPhone X with latest iOS system and latest fb update and I never get these ads. So it’s not like they’ve put in some sneaky work around to still access the mic.

A bunch of people at that party probably googled marshmallow cereal at or after the party and you guys started getting ads for it. It's not that wild.
