Here are the sentences that I extracted from the original text:

* Ford's counselor shared notes of what Ford said.
* It's not controversial to say that memories fade over time.
* It's not controversial to say that therapists and counselors are compassionate and are financially incentivized to make their clients feel good about themselves.
* The two combined can result in confabulation.
* Therapists are not trained investigators.
* I thought the calendar was good evidence that he was a party animal as a teen, one who got into trouble on a regular basis. It hardly exonerates him.
* You are much, much more concise than I am but that is exactly what I think ought to happen.
* The ambiguity of the entire thing and willingness to leave it at that should be a disqualifier in itself.
* He was a total asshole and asked the person *interviewing him for a job* if they had ever gotten blackout drunk after they asked him. That's really combatative, agressive and totally inappropriate. He does not belong on the bench.
* It is impossible to learn the truth if one believes one already knows it.
* Because reality is, so many people are so convinced she's telling the truth and he's lying but as of now, in reality, we have NO way of actually knowing that. Yet it's thrown around like it's gospel.
* Maybe it was Kavanaugh, maybe not. We will likely never know the truth.
* It's akin to a slippery slope argument.
* If that does happen, we will clearly see it happening and people can call it out.
* The Supreme Court should have only the best of the best with the squeakiest of clean records on it because it is absolutely critical for people to have faith in the highest court of our country.
* The world could really benefit from more humility. Pretending we know everything is a recipe for disaster.
* All of the grandstanding speeches were eyerollers.
* How about you don't fucking accuse somebody of rape when you don't have a clue if it was them who raped you.
* Does no body have sympathy for the accused? You people are ridiculous. Use your heads, there is absolutely nothing that proves he's a rapist.
* Please show me exactly where I accused him of rape.
* Dr. Ford said she was afraid he was going to rape her. She escaped.
* Rameriz said he exposed himself to her and she had to push him away.
* The third said she was a victim of a train rape in an environment where Kavanaugh (and Judge) were present. She never said Kavanaugh raped her.
