Here is the extracted summary:

All this anti vax nonsense hurts my head, you have to really suck at basic research to buy into this.

What?  So you can complain that people may feel differently than you?

I'm in total control hence the post, all this anti vax stuff is actually dangerous so yeah people really should call people out on it when it comes up. It's not like enjoying different tv shows this actually has repercussions for people. I'll call out anti vaxxers out forever just like i'll call out racism whenever possible.

No. We're complaining that you anti-vax numbnuts are risking pandemic disease because you have a 'feeling' that something is 'fishy.'

What I don't understand is people that don't trust the government at all, and think it's  incredibly evil and corrupted still get vaccines. Lol it fucking baffles me.

HUNDREDS? JESUS why isn't this blowing up on our country of 300 million and planet of 7 billion?!

You can find 1000's of examples of papers/testimonies written about vaccines working. I can also find 100's of testimonies from people supporting the flat earth theory too so that's why it's good to look at the actual science.

Feel free to never show up in this sub again, please.
Feel free to not reproduce for the good of mankind

That brings me to my next point, why automatically ASSume that I am your dirty little word?

It's a funny thing when someone on the anti vax side tries to insult someone's intelligence.
