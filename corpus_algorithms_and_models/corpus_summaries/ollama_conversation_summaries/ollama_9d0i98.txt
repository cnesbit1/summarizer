Here is the extracted summary:

I am tempted to have sex with a family friend because I sense from texts he is interested in me in that way.
I was hoping he wanted to talk to me relationship wise.
I've known him for eleven years now. See him usually a few times a year.
He knows and talks to my dad and my whole family. Doesn't he care that this could be awkward?
Why don't men think this way?
If he wanted you romantically, he would make that very clear and you wouldnâ€™t be on here asking what to do.
This is a difficult temptation because he's an attractive man. I feel flattered he even took interest
I'm sorry. This whole situation just has red flags written all over it.
Why say that?
Just because someone is interested in having sex with you, it doesn't mean they are into you as a person. You deserve more than that.
