Older Goldwings do look so much nicer so theyâ€™re definitely a consideration, I have also considered getting a Gwing and taking the fairings off but that makes the bike so much smaller and takes away a lot of storage which sort of defeats the purpose.

If you want a bike that is more comfortable than a Harley, more reliable, better built, nicer looking out of the box, and is American Made for the same money... buy an Indian.

Look at the Scout and Scout Bobber. You can add whatever level of farings or bags you want or don't, they come as 550'ish lbs and 100 bhp, so plenty of giddeeyup. And they are pretty reasonably priced - $12-14k OTD.

Mine was 13k with passenger seat/pegs, 0 down, 0% APR for 60 months.

The whole, "you'll spend more time fixing it than riding it" thing isn't true any longer.
