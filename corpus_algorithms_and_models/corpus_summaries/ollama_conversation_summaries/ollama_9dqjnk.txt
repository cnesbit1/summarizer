Here is the extracted summary:

It's a really good example of how racism can occupy our brains, and use us to teach racism to others, all while we genuinely believe ourselves immune.

when people are racist, they know they're racist. and it looks pretty intentional to me.

&gt; when people are racist, they know they're racist.

I wish. Lordy, do I wish. Yes, some do. But so, so many people manage to delude themselves into thinking they are not. That's how the "I'm not a racist, but..." trope came into existence.

it's an intentional choice, you're hunting for the brown colouring pencil. you're thinking, "bad Adam needs to have black skin; now that's done with, i'll make a skin colour change and make him white".

no non-racist person would do that.

&gt; no normal non-racist person

Doesn't exist. Everyone has unconscious bis. **Everyone.**
