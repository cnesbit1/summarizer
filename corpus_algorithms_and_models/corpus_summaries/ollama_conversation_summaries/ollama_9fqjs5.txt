Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

At 2:45pm I'm driving my buddy back to the hotel (19 of us live in a hotel while our new house gets built) and as I start to leave the lot, I see a car double-parked *directly center* over the yellow line. This balls-of-steel move paired with my previous frustration led to me getting *pissed*. This had to be deliberate.

So with the blessing of God himself I mustered all my strength to grab that sweet, hefty scoop that only comes once in a generation, and I catapulted it out of my window at the back of the double-parked car. Only about four or five fries actually landed on the trunk, and the rest hit the ground.

I then drove off with a big swinging dick, confident that I taught them a lesson the hard way not to double park.

10 minutes later it's 3:30pm and I'm in class, and I start to feel bad about doing it. After all, maybe the owner was in a rush or had a bad day too.

Then a little later, the buddy I dropped off texts me and says the hotel staff is looking for me. And they're pissed.
