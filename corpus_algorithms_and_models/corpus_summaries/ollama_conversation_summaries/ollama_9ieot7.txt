have never seen any actual evidence of this phenomenon...
I have lots of evidence. Who's going to do anything about it?

It's very similar to the panopticon, in that as long as somebody *feels* as if they are under surveillance, no actual surveillance is necessary. The person's behavior will change accordingly based on the idea that a surveillance program could and may be happening behind the scenes against them in their lives.

So you have lots of conspiracy theorists who get spooked or scared that they're being "targeted" by some element within TPTB, be it the CIA or some black ops group, and they watch a bunch of youtube videos on the subject, and I think they get absolutely caught up in the idea that they are important enough to have a surveillance program authorized against them.

Then, you assume that anybody you encounter in your daily interactions could be an "agent" deployed against you. You think any odd physical symptom is a "microwave attack" on you, or any number of wacky rationalizations to normal phenomenon.
