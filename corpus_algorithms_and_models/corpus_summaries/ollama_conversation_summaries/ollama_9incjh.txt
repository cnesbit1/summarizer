I (34f) had a baby a year and a half ago. Now when I have sex with my (40m) husband, I cant feel anything when he penetrates me.

We've been together for 10 years, prior to having a baby we would ease into sex because it would be to uncomfortable if we went to quickly. When we would go hard at it, I could feel him pounding deep inside me. Now even with the most vigorous  sex, I barely know he's in there.

He seems to still enjoy sex as much as he used to. I don't want him to feel bad so I haven't told him about this. The first time we had sex after the birth (7 weeks or so) it was painful. We waited a few more weeks before trying again and it's been like this ever since.

I can still cum from oral and I enjoy that, but I have a hard time participating because I'm trying to fake my way through because I cant feel what he's doing.

Am i just huge now? Could it be nerve damage?

Did you have a cesarean ?
