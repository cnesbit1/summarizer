Ride a cruiser with that level of torque and tell me its not fast

The weight is the big thing keeping me from the Harley’s, big power means very little when you’ve got big weight to push!!

I'm oblivious to most of the brands there & also to Harley... well anything really, but why does it sound like it's realy struggling to idle? Was that before the timing got fixed?

That's just the Harley sound. The connecting rods share a crank journal so on a 45 degree engine the timing would be 315 and 405 degrees. Gives it that irregular galloping idle.

I've ridden a tricked out Harley, my 600rr smokes it but the Harley was fast.

Okay?
