I’ve been feeling a little down about my performance in NS lately, cos of fitness mainly.

As many people say, nobody cares about NS outside of NS. But what do y’all think?

No one gives a shit whether you were an officer, spec, or man post NS, only how long you will be away for your reservist.

Heard numerous stories of men in NS being bosses of officers who were in the same vocational unit as them.So your rank in NS doesnt really matter much.

Well, the comment says no one gives a shit. So I’m just pointing out that some companies do care.
