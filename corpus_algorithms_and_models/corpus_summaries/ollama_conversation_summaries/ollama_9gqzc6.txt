Here is the summary of about 10% of the text:

At no point before full immersion water baptism is it possible for someone to be saved, or be biblically considered a Christian.

To be saved, the only thing required from you is your desire for God. If you desire him, God will save you by revealing Jesus Christ to you.

God 100% saves us, by His grace (Eph 2:8-9). But God’s grace is SUFFICENT, but it is CONDITIONAL.

You should alert James.

James says that without works faith is null. And of course we know that without faith works are null. Works *and* faith are both necessary for salvation.

Actually I would quote James too. He is saying if you claim to have faith, you have to have the works because faith produces works.

Baptism is a reaction to belief and repentance. The Ethiopian Eunuch heard Jesus preached to him, asked “What hinders name from being baptized?” Philip said “If you believe with all your heart you may.”  And so he was baptized accordingly (Acts 8)

Please quote the verse. That's not what he is saying he says, "You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone." And, "For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."

Fruits and works are different. Paul refers to workings of the Spirit and fruits of the Spirit as different things.

That is the context, and instead of supporting your argument it completely refutes it.

Baptism doesn't have a necessity in God's original plan for mankind.

False. Baptism is not *your* work. God's grace moves people to baptism. You are being arrogant if you think it's *your* work.

Please explain how that philosophy of yours fits into, say, 1 Peter 3:21. Or Romans 6. Or Titus 3. Or Mark 16:16.

I don't believe baptism was a question when the bible was written.
