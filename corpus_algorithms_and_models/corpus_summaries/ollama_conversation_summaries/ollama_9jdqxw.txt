Here is the summary of about 10% of the text or up to 250 words:

We got them so we could sleep better after having a baby. We also got a ridiculously comfortable new king sized bed. So anyways, we took the edibles and split a bottle of wine. We then went to bed and had an absolute marathon sex session. It just felt like we could both have sex with each other for hours and hours.

I've been thinking of taking small doses with my gf . Like 5mg -10mg range Each cube is ~2mg. We started out taking one, waiting an hour, take one more, wait an hour and take a third. That was ok but felt weak.

But yeah i figured around 5mg would be ok. I used to be able to take 100mg per serving but that was a couple years back when my tolerance was high.

I want my gf to be able to experience that as well but i know if we over do it, it becomes hard to even focus lol.

Its a fine balance to walk.

Best!

5 seems like a good place to start. Most of the edibles sold here start at 10 but you can always cut them in half.

after a few times, you might notice more effects from the same dose as cannabis tends to have a reverse tolerance of sorts.
