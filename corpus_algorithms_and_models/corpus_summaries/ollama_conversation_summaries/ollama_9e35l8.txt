This is what I feel Mandarin lessons in Singapore. They focus too much on the actual memorisation of words and idioms. Things like giving a news article to you to decipher isn't going to help because these aren't common in everyday speech.

I just wish that they would focus more on daily conversational stuff, which I feel is more important. If you know what to call a word, you'd probably be able to at least guess how it's written. How is forcing them to answer questions based on a bunch of China stories going to help if they are reading something that they're unfamiliar to begin with?

Just think about it, most people aren't really bad at Chinese. They know the basic sentence structures, it's just that they use a lot of loan words when they don't know a certain 單詞 in Mandarin.

Chinese education is already almost non-existent in Singapore and you want to turn our Chinese syllabus into some half-arsed 'Chinese as a second language'?

I feel that it's the Chinese characters that's the problem. There's a lot of people that I know who are completely fluent in Singaporean Mandarin but still somehow struggled with Chinese lessons in school because they couldn't understand what they're reading or what they're required to write.
