Here is the extracted summary:

Hey! Poo explosion guy here, I picked up the peeing in bottles while driving bug too. I find it best to smoosh the head a little bit to make a mushroom vent. Should be good to go.

Oh god dude
This is why aliens don't talk to us

I don’t think he removed it. If you look at his profile it was also posted on a military sub. So either he forgot that one or he didn’t remove the one on here himself.

He didn't remove by choice, apparently anything dealing with pissing/shitting is removed by mod team under "rule 2c Common fuckups".

Wonder if there are some of their population who are pissed their government doesn't allow them to make contact with us, cause you know, they'd be into it.
