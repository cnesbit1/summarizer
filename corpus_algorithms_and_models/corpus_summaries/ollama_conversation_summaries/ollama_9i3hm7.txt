Here is the extracted summary:

Just a curious kid lol
this is nuts.
c sections are only done when medically necessary for the health of the baby or mother.
Unfortunately, that really varies by doctor and location.
Not wanting to go through labor is a valid reason not to give birth, and I'm not trying to say that it isn't. But, it's not like having a c-section is just a no big deal alternative.

Natural birth sounds too painful. I always thought I’d have a c section because my idea of one was:
- you would fall asleep by anaesthetic 
- they’d take the baby out and stitch you back up
- you wake up and you’ve got a baby + some pain on your stomach that will last a month or so.
I’ll take the risk of the surgery. I could also buy lots of pain killers I guess.

scarring above the bikini line.  
risk of infection.  
possible future complications.

As the previous commenter said, it’s not just the surgery you have to contend with—it’s very worth noting that a c-section also often takes much longer to recover from as well. It’s by no means an easy way out of childbirth—just different.

You can get medications for vaginal birth. Vaginal and natural birth don’t mean the same thing the maternity/pregnancy circles
