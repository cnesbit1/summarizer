hi guys! i’ve been starting to exercise recently to work on my tummy fats especially, so i’ve been mainly doing abs workouts routines and also thighs. but is it normal for me not to feel the post workout burn in my stomach area? and any tips for tummy fat loss? i’m not sure if this targeted exercises will help. i’ve been also tryna eat healthier!

Eat less rice/carbs, do sit ups and squats.
Less rice, cut sugar completely.

you cant spot reduce fat. to get rid of fat you need overall fat loss aka more cardio/hiit.

There's no such thing as targeted exercise. You will lose tummy fat once your overall fat % is lowered.

like what they're saying, targeted exercises work only for developing muscle but not for burning fat.

to lose fat all around, you just need to eat less calories and/or engage in physical activities.

all in all, do things in moderation and don't rush through weight loss.
