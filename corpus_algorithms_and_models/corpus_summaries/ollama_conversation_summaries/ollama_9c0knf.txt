Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* Well, they're not into it, so why are they in the church?
* Because they feel it is the right place for them, for whatever reason, and feel they can disagree with the Church on matters.
* People confess crimes to the Police all the time. Arguing this law is pointless as people wont confess is just not correct. People will still confess crimes to priest after mandatory reporting is introduced.
* That is really unlikely. People are far more likely to confess to *any* crime in confidence than they are to the police.
* It would pressurise someone to seek treatment.
* Not only would it pressurise someone to seek treatment, if someone had enough belief to go to confession, they would feel it as a severe punishment.
* Because nobody ever changes their faith or loses it?
* Pressure isn't a viable treatment nor punishment either. What if they don't? What if they delude themselves into thinking they were already forgiven? Would you really trust a child abuser with that?
* In that case its no worse than if they did not confess at all.
* Of course it would be better if they were caught, but someone confessing it has usually *not* been caught so its a chance to persuading them to seek treatment that would be lost by deterring them from confessing.
* The majority of child abusers are never caught, or are caught years later. Anything that may stop them earlier is a good thing.
* Lawyers are required to report any criminal activity that occurs, or they believe will occur, while they are the legal representative of their client.
* There is no such thing as repentance and penitence if an abuser isn't turned in and doesn't stop abusing.
* People confess to police and other mandatory reporters like doctors, social workers, and mental health professionals.
* Also its not always the perpetrator who discloses during confesses, sometimes its the victim, someone involved in the cover up, a witness ect.
* Covering up abuse doesn't get treatment for the perpetrator or relief for the victim. Reporting does.
* If you actually thought it was more important to protect children you would be for compelling priests to report these crimes to the Police so that abusers can be caught and prosecuted.
* That is really unlikely. People are far more likely to confess to any crime in confidence than they are to the police.
* The problem is that the "less people" would be near zero, so it would do more harm thatn good.
* If the victim or someone else, again, they can be encouraged to go to the police. Again, they may not confess if they know it will be reported.
* Also, I am not sure why a victom would confess - they did not commit any sin.
* I doubt very much it would be near zero.
* Seriously. You think child abusers are going to queue up to turn themselves in?
