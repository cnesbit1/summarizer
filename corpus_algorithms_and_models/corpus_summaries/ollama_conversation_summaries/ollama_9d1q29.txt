Here is a summary of the text, up to 250 words:

Isn't safety and brotherly love important? so why would a biker smash something that the driver would need to see a fellow biker?  Go for the taillights or headlights... maybe the police will get them...

You don't think logically while raging.

I've seen driver's hit and run over bikers JUST because they don't like motorcycles. 

So you've seen bikers get HIT and RUN OVER for NO OTHER reason than being on a bike.  The biker was just minding his own business following the law and BLAM.  Out of nowhere a car smashes the biker and the only reason the car did it was because the guy was on a bike.

Yeah, that's pretty much bullshit.
Yes, unfortunately.

I've been hit-and-run on my bike, and I've seen cars intentionally clip cyclists because they were mad they were in the road.
