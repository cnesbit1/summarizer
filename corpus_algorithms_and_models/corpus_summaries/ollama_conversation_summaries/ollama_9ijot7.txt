Here is the summary:

Yes IMO Iâ€™m in Ohio folliwed this closely possible cartel hit these folks had a LARGE weed grow operation i believe.
Correct. In addition they were mouthy and bullied several local people.

In Ohio too. I actually drove by one of the Rhoden houses the day after it happened going to Athens. Super surreal hearing about it on the news, turning a corner on 32, and then bam, news trucks and cop cars all over the place.
Mouthy and bullying should not = death so no karma is not karma the way you phrased it.

Sorry I just looked it up, it was around[ 200 total plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_County,_Ohio,_shootings#Discovery_of_marijuana_and_cockfighting_operations) but even that isn't anything the cartel would get involved with.
karma IS bullshit.  terrible things happen to good people everyday and vice versa
