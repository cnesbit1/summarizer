Here is the extracted summary:

To preface, I have had some pretty abusive relationships, both physically and emotionally in the past.

Anyway, I've been dating my boyfriend for about 3 years. We have had major ups and downs due to my self esteem issues, especially with my breasts. They aren't super small, but they aren't giant and they are definitely not perky. They are what I would classify as tuberous.

He has said a ridiculous amount of times that he loves them, but there was one moment a few months ago where he did say he wished they were bigger and rounder.

I know I shouldn't have, and I know it's a bad sign, but he left his phone on the coffee table tonight. Old habits die hard.

Anyway, I brought it up to him tonight and he completely brushed off like it was nothing, saying when did I ever say I didn't watch porn?

How do I move forward with this? I guess the fact that he lied to me just rubs me the wrong way, big time.

It's genuinely the fact that he lied about it multiple times and then pretends like those words never came out of his mouth, which they definitely did. That is what bothers me.

I did try talking to him and asking him questions in a completely conversational (but obviously slightly angry) and he just wouldn't answer anything.

Ask him again in a non confrontational way. Tell him it's ok if he watches porn but you just want him to be honest and you won't get mad.

The problem is we've already had this conversation and he was still not truthful about it
