Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, consisting of approximately 250 words:

*No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.* [John 1: 18]
If they were a *three-in-one* God known as 'God' like the Trinity claims then the apostle John would have to be a liar because he said no-one has ever seen God.
He makes a distinction between the Father being a God that nobody has ever seen and the Son being a God that has been seen.
- The Father = 1st God
- The Son = 2nd God

*The Father is the eternal source of the Godhead, from whom the Son is begotten eternally and also from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally*

To beget means to bring about... If God didn't create Jesus Christ then how did he 'bring him about'....?
Oh God resolved it.. did he? Ye are gods!

Note: I've excluded sentences that don't add much context or value to the summary, and focused on the core ideas and quotes.
