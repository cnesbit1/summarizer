Here is the summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

I have a condition called uterus didelphys. This means my reproductive system is split down the middle by a septum, creating two sides to everything.

At the end of July I decided to have the septum retracted in my vagina to form one canal. The surgery was non-invasive but the recovery period was about a month and a half.

SO, we had sex last night/this morning, and LEMME TELL YOU SOMETHIN. I FEEL LIKE A BRAND NEW WOMAN! I essentially lost half of my virginity because like damn I was missing out.

So yeah. That's basically it. I'm just hella happy because I now have access to a whole other side of my vagina and I have a great person to work out the kinks with.

Ohh yeah! Wanna share? I only have one haha
