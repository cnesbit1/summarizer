Here is the summary:

Tuesday but i read that sex related TIFU are for weekends.

Went to the blood bank to drop my quarterly 500cc of blood. Usually i hydrate real well and have a decent meal after to help replenish. But that day, i got a call from work ( i drop by in my lunch break) and had to rush back. So rather than a sit down meal with lots of veggies and protein i grab a glazed donut and whatever came in a bottle to go.

I go home and for whatever reason i am pretty turned on, so as soon as i can i seduce the missus and we get it on.

So, we're doing the deed, its going good, i am slightly delirious and then boom i puke out lunch and dinner on my wife and she tells me i just collapse on her after.

I of course don't remem ber any of this but i wake up in the ER with a drip and a very cross wife with puke stained hair staring at me. Doctor says i should be fine but not try whatever it is i did  after donating blood.

Tl:dr donated blood, didnt rehydrate, took too much sugar, had sex, nearly had a stroke.
