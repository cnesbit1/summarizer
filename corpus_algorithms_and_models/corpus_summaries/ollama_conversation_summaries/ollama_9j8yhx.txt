Here is the summary:

The reasoning for a man saying no is not relevant. No simply means no.
You've recieved the same answer 4+ times that yes, this is a red flag. Why? Because he sees that his money is going towards having sex, and that's it.
If he wanted to see **YOU** his reply would be "**Fuck yeah**.
And literally everyone is telling you this is a bad idea for the exact same reason and yet you keep asking for explanations and justifications.
Well hopefully now you have “multiple opinions” that all say don’t do it. It doesn’t matter how big his dick is, you SHOULD NOT hook up with this guy. Delete him/block him/drop him and move on.
Look kid, I don’t have time for this. Everyone said the same thing. They used different words, but they said the same thing.
