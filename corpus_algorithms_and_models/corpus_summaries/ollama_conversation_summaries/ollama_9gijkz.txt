For more acceleration, use either a smaller sprocket at front or bigger sprocket at back - or maybe both if you're replacing both sprockets and chain at one time.

... If I were to go to 12 front and 54 rear (which looks like the modding max), what would my top speed drop down to? Holy moly that's a massive jump, it'd probably half your top speed!!

Going to a 13 front and 41 rear increases your ratio a good amount, will defo increase your lower end pull whilst shaving about 15km/h off your top speed, if you want a bit more than add teeth to the back but I wouldn't go down to a 12 front.

You don't wanna be having your top speed as the speed you're gonna cruise at as that'd be bad for your engine and chain sitting at that much stress constantly.

Thank you so much that is EXTREMELY helpful! What do you think is a safe (for the longevity of the bike) cruising rev limit?
