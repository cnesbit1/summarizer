This is really difficult for me to post, but I just wanted to see if there's anyone out there who is on a similar boat as me.

Being a Christian with liberal views often feels like navigating two opposing personalities that cannot coexist. When I'm with my church friends, I hide away my liberalness. I fear I'll be judged, and treated as unworthy, when I know I'm worthy of God's love.

I believe progressives really work on stepping down from their positions in life to truly love thy neighbor. 

When it comes to abortion, I do believe it's wrong, but I don't see a way around this social problem that is humane for the woman and baby involved.

I'm not here to argue my political opinions, I've just felt so lonely and alienated from my church community and wanted to know if there's people out there who share my experience.

Yeah, I came out on Facebook and no one from there has said a word about it, but at church yesterday, when he said as he preached about homosexuality and I think he looked right at me when he said bisexuality. 

I'm bi also and had an encounter with conservative Baptists in my youth. So I empathize.

Thank you, btw.

I hope you can find a more welcoming place.
