Usually just stick to a t-shirt and underwear when I'm in my room, but would it be sexier to pull off a girl's shirt to reveal a sexy bra as an added bonus, or would you just prefer straight boobs?

I'm probably overthinking this, but hey, I buy cute bras for a reason.

Edit: Thanks guys! Clear consensus seems to be no bra, which is the most comfortable state for both parties. ðŸ™ƒ

Bras are just shackles on the soul of a woman

actually bras cause the muscles that make boobs curve upwards to atrophy and have no effect on sagging.
Tyoical guy answer .. maybe a pushup bra does but your typical woman does not walk around wearing a pushup bra...

A bra is just a piece of clothing not magic.

Do you have a source on that? Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t believe you, itâ€™s just that it goes against my intuition and Iâ€™d like to see some actual study or research that came to this conclusion.

It depends on the size of the breast, perkiness comes from both the muscles and the connective tissues.
