Silky. Might be hope for Ottawa after all. Anyone know what the plan for him is this year? I heard something about the London Knights, but I also heard they might put him in the big show, at least to start?

He's in an interesting situation right now, where he could play in Ottawa, the AHL, or London.

He was drafted out of the NCAA, not the CHL
