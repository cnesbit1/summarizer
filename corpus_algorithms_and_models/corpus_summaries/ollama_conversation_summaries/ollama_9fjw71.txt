Here is the summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

I guess I was mentally unfit to ride today. Came to a stop at parking lot, put in neutral, *thought* I put the stand down, leaned left, and "oopsâ€”shiiiiiiit!"

Got the bike back up and found the end of clutch lever on the ground, along with an unknown plastic part (any idea what it is?). Scuffed the mirror and the turn signals but otherwise seemed fine(oh yeah sure keep telling yourself it's fine).

Stone me.
That's a good lesson to learn, check your kickstand twice before going for a ride and after you stopped!

Glad you're OK and your bike too (a lever is not too expensive, maybe it's time for a little upgrade ðŸ˜‰)

I've done this before..... more than once. shit happens
