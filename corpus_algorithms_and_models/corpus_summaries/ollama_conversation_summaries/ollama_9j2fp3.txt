Here is the summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

Because historians of the time, people involved, etc. wrote about it when it actually happened. We don't have that with the Bible. Most of the authors are anonymous and most of it was written at least decades after the event with no contemporary historians mentioning the events.

There is mention of Jesus by contemporary historians. You need to remember as well that he was just someone one the outskirts of the Roman Empire who was executed. Thereâ€™s no reason why this would have been a big deal and been overly reported.

We still have lots of backing evidence. The leadership obviously changed. Coinage changed. Other people rose to power. Caesar was no longer written about as leading armies or referred to in records.

There are several different systems historians use to figure out how trustworthy different sources are. The Gospels don't do well in these systems, which is why "Bible scholars" are a separate field from historians.
