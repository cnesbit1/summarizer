One time, my family and I had just returned from Japan and we needed a big cab to load up all our baggage. So this prime MPV turned up and he refused to take us because we live in Tampines. On top that, he was extremely rude. Plus, he started arguing with the neighbouring taxi Drivers and he airport Marshalls promptly told him to leave, which he did.

Luckily another MPV taxi turned up, and the driver his round was SUPER friendly.

I used to give the ones who don't make noise $3 to $4 on top of the fare.
But now I just Grab back.
