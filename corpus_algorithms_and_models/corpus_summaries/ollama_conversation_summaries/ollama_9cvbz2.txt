Damn carful what you post I guess
*slaps roof*

This badboy can fit so many incriminating posts!
Did you just slap the roof of Reddit?

I will make it legal.
[deleted]
Not. Yet.

This is exactly why I delete my accounts every 6-12 months. There always comes a point where there's too much identifiable information associated with my account from normal use.

Good thing I'm paranoid and always under the impression that someone is watching me... Probably some really really bored person.

Is the username /u/thisismyaltaccountsoicanpostaboutwork available?

Reminds me I need to do this. Have been putting it off for a few months. On to account #4

no. this is illegal.Therefore, we should all go to gulag.

There's nothing guaranteeing your anonymity. These are just steps to make it harder.

The main thing is comments by deleted accounts show as authored by [deleted] to the general public.

Would regularly deleting posts help?

Yeah, but that is significantly more work. There's plugins to do it, but I'd rather just delete the account entirely.

Do note that there's also plugins out there that un-delete comments. So if you're deleting comments, but they're still associated with "queseyoqueyoquese", they could still be used to piece together your identity.
