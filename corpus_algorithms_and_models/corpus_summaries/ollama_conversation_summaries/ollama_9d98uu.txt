Finally got myself a copy of X!! I'm looking for some help to do an egglocke of the game, so was wondering if you guys could help me get a party of 6 by trading me eggs (without telling me the contents or anything)

If you want something in exchange, I've got a few female DB Pokémon (No HA) or a few male DBHA Pokémon, all with 4EM in my AS I could give you.

Thanks for the help, I'm hoping I get something exciting.

EDIT: Have the following that fit the above criteria 
* Aerodactyl (2F, 2M)
* Axew( 1M)
* Omanyte (No HA, 3M)
* Murkrow (3F)
* Munna (1F)
* Starly (4F) 
* Karrablast (1M)
* Buneary (1M)

Do you still need help?
