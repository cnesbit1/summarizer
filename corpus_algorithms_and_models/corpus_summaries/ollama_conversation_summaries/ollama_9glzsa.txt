Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

Is it a sin to have sex with someone before marrying that person? Is it also a sin to have sex with significant others who you do not marry?

Yes.

Can you show where the Bible says this?
Any time the Bible uses the word fornication that means sex before marriage.
Can you point me to a lexicon that says this, or a scholar of ancient Hebrew and/or Greek who can explain this?

Because the Bible uses mostly principles instead of laws, you will never find the words "premarital sex is a sin" within the Bible. However, if you use critical thinking skills, there are multiple verses in the Bible that point to this.

One such verse is 1 Corinthians 6:9 lists (depending on translation or version, this particular one is King James) "fornicators" as those not inheriting the kingdom of God.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines fornication as sex between two unmarried persons [see source here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fornication). Therefore a fornicator is a person who has sex to someone they are not married to.

In conclusion, since people who commit fornication will not inherit God's Kingdom, and since sinners do not inherit God's Kingdom, both of OPs questions can be answered.
