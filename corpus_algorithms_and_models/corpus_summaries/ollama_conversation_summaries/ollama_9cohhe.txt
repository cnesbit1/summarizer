Only the idiots in the cities. If you can pass the PAL you should be allowed. Those that dont pass the test should not have guns.

I don't support a handgun ban
I do.
Oh so you’re down to take away the privileges of others because of some made up fantasy in your head.

He was a law abiding gun nut when he got up that morning, not a criminal.
Where?  Which incident?

So he used a rifle, and yet it's a handgun ban you are in favour of.  Or maybe all firearms, so only the Police and Military can have them.  Yeah, that'll work out well for the populace.

My point is: if a criminal wants to hurt somebody they’re going to find an alternative way to do it with or without a gun.
Vehicles, knives, dogs, poisonings, drugs, Bombs... I mean the list is endless you can use pretty much anything as a weapon to hurt somebody else.
