Here are the selected sentences:

I agree with you. I find it disconcerting that all except your comment (so far) thought the undergraduate was too sensitive. I think the other comments were, on the contrary, not sensitive enough.

We live in Singapore so we probably weren't affected by 9/11 much. But it shouldn't take a person so much effort to realize that people who were friends of family of victims could still be traumatized even after 17 years.

What is a joke to us may not be a joke to others, especially in this highly interconnected generation of the Internet.

If something on the internet offends you, just close the tab.

I firmly believe that social media networks such as Facebook and Reddit should also be regulated or even censored, as they frequently contain posts, graphics and memes of similar nature

You raise hate speech, which I assume to be against issues such as race and religion, as an exception. If it my belief that [certain race] is inferior than others, should you censor me?

Terrorism is a form of hate. In this 9/11 case, it is hate on a nation, namely the USA, and even the world.

If your friend makes a racist joke to a group of people, do you correct your friend or report it to the police? Their actions may be insensitive but it did not warrant a police report.

I think we can agree that terrorism is ‘more dangerous’ than racism. Racism may not warrant a police report, but that does not mean terrorism does not warrant a police report.

1) How severe is it? If you post ‘[certain race] are dumb lol’, a few people would probably get angry but not to the extent that they would report it. But if you post ‘I want to **kill** all the [certain race]’ which is very similar to terrorism, would you *not* report it?

3) Is it truly a ‘joke’? I think this is similar to point one. Calling someone dumb may be a joke, but killing? You may argue that ‘they joked about killing in a light tone’, but remember, this is the Internet where written tone cannot be conveyed.

I do not understand your last sentence, because I do not know what Islam's worldview is, so I can't argue against you on this point.

Ideas are like a double-edged sword, good or bad, it must surface and people must battle against bad ideas.

Food for thought since it seems serious enough to you, how many cases of terrorist attacks surfaced from memes?

As for how many cases, I do not know. But does the number matter? Does it matter if it happened 0, 1, or 100 times?

Welcome to the internet. Somewhere out there (in conversations, other forums) it will be discussed.

So why are people bashing the undergraduate for reporting it to the police? He raised the issue to the police’s attention, and the police are investigating to take precautions, no?

What is that ‘something’ that vlogs, blogs, newspapers do not have?

I still don’t understand what is this ‘truth’ you are talking about so I can’t argue against that.

The intent should be quite obvious.

That message - through use of meme - was not malicious. The intent should be quite obvious.

The same for me: How you can't grasp that a meme is **typically** and thus **not always** humorous in nature 

Because context! I think I understand why you got down-voted now. Take care.

The context is **there indeed exists less-than-sane people out there who can view the meme in question, because this meme is visible to anyone and everyone who has access to instagram (instagram is free, account was also public), you cannot ensure that everyone who can view it is sane**, so the undergraduate reporting it to police was justified.
