Here is the extracted summary:

Thatâ€™s some fifty shades shit.
Never read it.
Itâ€™s a book where the girls a journalist, they meet when she interviews him, they fall in love, he turns out to be a BDSM fanatic. Never read it either but itâ€™s everywhere these days.

I would argue that itâ€™s not some 50 shades shit because:
* OP wasnâ€™t stalked or controlled. There was consent and She felt safe.
* Her writing is a thousand times better than 50 shades

Thank you my dear! We filmed the whole session so I am pretty sure it didn't happen in my imaginationðŸ˜Š
