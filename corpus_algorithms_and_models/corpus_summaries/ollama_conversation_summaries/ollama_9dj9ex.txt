Here is a summary of up to 250 words, extracted from the original text:

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just issued a landmark ruling that found that arresting homeless people for sleeping outside violates their constitutional rights.

FTA: "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized sitting, lying, or sleeping are all “universal and unavoidable consequences of being human.” The city is not permitted to criminalize sleeping on outside property, especially if there are no beds available at homeless shelters."

If you think it's okay to lock up a homeless person for sleeping on the ground in public because he's homeless, then you have a fucked up sense of values.

Criminalizing the homeless is particularly a large problem in Florida but this lawsuit was against Boise, a city in Idaho.

Homeless people are also people, just because they're poor it doesn't mean they somehow become less human.

Well according to reality, they are all doing a shit job of it, still not a conspiracy. This is Democratic policy coming home to roost. Enjoy it.

You act like it is an easy solution for the sheer amount of homeless that exist and would rather just blame it on democrats.
