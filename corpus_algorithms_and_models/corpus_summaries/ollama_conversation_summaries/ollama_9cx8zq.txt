Here is the summary of about 10% of the text:

Like I knew they were strong, but literally any one of their top 6 could arguably be a 1st line player on most other teams.

Not sure if you're being sarcastic but I dunno, just cause a player gets 1st line time doesn't make them a first liner. A first liner is a guy that can drive the offence and Marleau can't do it anymore, Hyman is a complimentary player and Nylander isn't there yet.

I cant name more than 3 other teams that have as good or better top 6 than the Leafs. Tampa, Winnipeg and maybe Washington? Pittsburgh?

That's very debatable.

But a case could be made either way.

For sure. There's good argument's for both.
