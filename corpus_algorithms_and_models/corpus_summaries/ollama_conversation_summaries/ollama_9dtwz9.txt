Here are the extracted sentences:

2017, we added 26,000 jobs. In 2016 We added 22,000 jobs
So....the past two years averaged 24k new jobs.
This year we lost 51.6k jobs
No. Month to month numbers don't mean anything. We might add 50k jobs next month, then lose another 50k the next month after that. You have to look at the longer term trend
> This year we lost 51.6k jobs
Admittedly, I could have phrased that better.
I should have said "*this year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August.*"
As for the year-long picture, [this guy's post covers that ground](https://old.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/9dtwz9/canadian_economy_lost_51600_jobs_in_august/e5kajvw/).
I don't think you understand what "in August" means
I phrased it poorly.
I should have said 
> "in the past two Augusts, we averaged 24k new jobs"
> "This year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August"
You have to understand what "unemployment" means - First there's population, and out of that population only a certain amount of people are in the labour force (people between age 16 and 65 who's not in school or a stay at home parent, or unable to work due to disability, etc) and then out of all those people, those that are recently looking for jobs in the last 3 months are considered "unemployed" and the % between those that are looking for jobs in the last 3 months vs the labour force is the unemployment rate
