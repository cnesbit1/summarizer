One of the most memorable stories from the trip came post-game in Shenzhen. After the game, the players all boarded the bus headed towards the airport to catch a flight to Beijing. However, in the underground parking lot of the arena, things took a rough start. On the first turn in what can only be described as a labyrinth of a parking structure, our delightful bus driver rammed his right-side rearview mirror directly into two air conditioning units, shaking the entire bus as sparks flew outside the windows.

The rearview mirror was bent completely out of position, causing it to block our bus door and the only way to exit the bus. Despite the driver's best efforts to open the door from the inside, it would not budge. Eventually, it caught the attention of the other buses with GMBT trying to dislodge the mirror but unfortunately cutting his hand in the process. Finally, another driver managed to pull the mirror back into a somewhat acceptable position, amidst the typhoon of chirps coming from the players on the bus.

We decided then just to drive to the airport with one and a half rearview mirrors in order to make our flight. Hilarity, stress, and sheer astonishment rolled into one unique experience.
