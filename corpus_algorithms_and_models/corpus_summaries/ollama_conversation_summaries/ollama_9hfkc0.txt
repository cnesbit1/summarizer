Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I'm still trying to find where I fit and it feels like no church will ever align with 100% of my beliefs.

In my head there's room for 'we might be wrong/not know all' about: papal supremacy, perpetual virginity of Mary, auricular confession, transsubstation, CCC being as important as it is now, women's role, purgatory, weddings being ok only in church, contraception, sexuality, clergy vs laity, and saints.

I probably left something out. That's a whole lot of 'If the Church doesn't have authority to declare those things then why even be Catholic?'

You might want to look around and see if any other denominations feel right, as you disagree with a *lot* of Catholic teachings.

It really sounds like you may be struggling with how do I know the Bible to be true?' or maybe even a step further back at 'how do I know God exists?'

'If you can establish both of those it really takes a reflection of Catholic belief throughout Scripture and then affirming it throughout the oral tradition to be convincing intellectually.'

many people in other denominations have no problems with believing in God and trusting the Bible
