I mean, Karlsson/Stone/Duchene need to be traded is what most people think logically, so how can it be bigger? Which other major piece do they plan on trading?

Or, and tinfoil hat theory here, does this "bigger change" have something to do w/ Stevie Y leaving Tampa?

I know this is all far-fetched, but I just wanted to mention that Steve Yzerman grew up in Ottawa.

His family is still in Detroit though. I'd say Detroit is the end game for Yzerman.

Maybe if he wanted to live/work in Ottawa at all costs?  But yeah I can't imagine that happening in a million years.

Yzerman was playing NHL GM Mode on easy in TB.

Nobody wants to live in Ottawa, in fact, you should avoid living there at all costs.

Ottawa is a fantastic city to live in.
