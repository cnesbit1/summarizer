Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text (up to 250 words):

As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.”

Well like I said in my OP (if you would just read), according to my grandmother, her pastor picked up on a curse before we were born.

According to the Christian YouTuber I watched, these are the obvious signs of cursed twins:

1. Hate each other
2. Constantly fight
3. Constantly Disobey their parents
4. Compete with one another 
5. Bring constant misery and pain to their mother 

My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.

We both struggle with mental issues that makes it hard for us to be normal independent adults.

How do they know? How does one 'detect' a curse?

All these are things that siblings (and children in general) do... My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.
