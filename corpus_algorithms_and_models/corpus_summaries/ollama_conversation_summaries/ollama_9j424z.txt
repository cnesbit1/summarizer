Here is the extracted summary:

Twice? Well, there's your problem. If you'd have killed the first one and carried it's head around on your pillion, you wouldn't have this problem todayâ€¦.

I feel you. I stopped riding at night after two drunk drivers hit me within 3 months of each other.

Drivers are distracted and don't give an F about it.

One guy who hit me is still in jail though, so some justice came of it.

This is the problem with society today, we no longer drink from the skulls of our enemies.

"why did you kill that girl?!" - officer

"blacked out, i don't know what happened" - you

&gt;"why did you kill that girl?!" - officer

"Um, I was on my phone, just for a second, and when I looked up her head was bungee'd to my pillion."

Cups have made us soft...
