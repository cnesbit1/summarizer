My boyfriend and I have been together for five months. Our relationship is great and we truly deeply care about eachother.

There is one problem though: he has a secret kink which he has kept me in the dark about and I’m really nervous he’s hiding it from me because he’s afraid it will scare me off.

I know this subject is sensitive but it’s been around four months since we had that conversation. I kind of forgot about it since then but recently started thinking about it because he has started joking around asking “if I was into (insert random kink) here would you do that with me?”, these jokes have become frequent and I think it might be his way of feeling out whether he’s ready to tell me.

I’m getting impatient, I know it’s not really fair of me to pry or make him tell me when he’s not ready but what if it’s a serious kink, something that’s scary for me, or something that I hear about and can never look at him the same way again.
