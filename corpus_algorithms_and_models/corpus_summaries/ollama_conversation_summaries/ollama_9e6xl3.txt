No one? Nah, someone will. It won't be me though. Won't pay more to a corrupt government monopoly when I can get it cheaper on the black market and still have shatter included in my order.

Jodi Emery has a great list of all the big cannabis execs who were former prohibitionist in conservative governments, police and religious lobby groups. Fuck all of them. I'll stick to what I know and pay less for it.

Not everyone said legalize it and tax if. Those of us who knew what government was like wanted decriminalization because we didn't want them to seize control of the market and shut out the very people who built it in the first place which is exactly what they've done.

We wanted liberty, not government monopolies.

You seem to confuse monopolies with taxation.

No I'm not. You want to buy from your local dealer because they don't charge taxes. Same as you can buy from a tobacco bootlegger or an alcohol bootlegger and not pay taxes.

I'll stick to what I know and pay less for it.
