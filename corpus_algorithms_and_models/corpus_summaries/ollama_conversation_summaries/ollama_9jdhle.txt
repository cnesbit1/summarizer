It's easy to conflate powerlessness with innocence. Even if someone is too young to have done anything wrong, they're still conceived of sinful parents, and with a sinful nature. After all children don't need to be taught to lie, that comes naturally to them. They need to be taught to tell the truth.

Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

You're not born a sinner. If that was the case, Messiah would have been a sinner because it was said multiple times he was and is a man and that innocent children would be going to hell if they died.

Uh... yes it does. Psalm 51:5 " Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me."

Does that mean Yeshua was a sinner? No. Why? A child isn’t aware of what is good and evil, especially someone who isn’t born yet.
