Probably they were busy?

I mean, do that all the time.

if you are this crazy and upset over him not answering in a few hours, to the point of posting on reddit....dont be concerned if anyone ever says you have crazy eyes.

You see, the thing is that going on a vacation is not something you decide casually. It takes time. I usually reserve such conversations for the end of the day when I'm free and can devote my time to the topic. Meanwhile during the day, I fuck around doing whatever I like. Casually.

Here we go. Your 'him not replying' problem solved. Cheers. Don't try to overthink such situations from now on.

You should post his FB, I think we need to warn him about you lol.
