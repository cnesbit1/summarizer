Here are the relevant sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* "Not leaving children alone, mandatory background checks, training, professional examinations, glass/see-through doors and windows inside classrooms, fingerprinting, and anonymous (or not) hotlines and web forms for submitting complaints, and zero-tolerance policies (reported complaint = removed from ministry pending criminal investigation)."
* "A grown adult who is into a sexually mature, but still not adult individual (16/17) has a morality problem. (It's a large one I don't mean to minimize, FWIW.) A grown adult into a pre or mid-puberty child has a deeper, much worse problem."
* "If the postulation that 'that many priests went into ministry because they were born gay, and celibacy through ministry was the honorable route to deal with the tendencies' is to be considered, then you need to come up with evidence for that fact. Given what is known about lack of gender preference of pedophiles, given known preferences of gay men for *adult* partners, and given the significant disparity in *access* to the genders of youngsters in the church to clergy, you need a much stronger claim than 'well, most of them were boys.'"
* "The seal of confession is still honored in the US. Nonetheless, the above policies work really well."
* "What I am trying to tell you is that it merits at least consideration. Ideology should not keep us from considering anything. Lack of evidence other than 'well, some people think it' *should* keep us from considering. Bring some reasoning or evidence, and it should be considered. Until then, it is as valid a theory as 'the lizard people commanded it.'"
* "The John Jay Report says that the biggest demographic of abusers were those with no definitive view of their sexuality. This is vague but worth more inspection to sort out greater details."
