This kind of video sets up a worst case scenario for non-ABS bikes, reinforcing the view that ABS is only for newbies or old fools.

I don't know if this has been tested for motorcycles, but research shows that most car drivers consider themselves well above average in driving skill/competency. Similarly, many motorcyclists likely believe they can out-brake an ABS system.

A better test should use a rider with high competency/credibility, such as a professional racer, and repeat tests in both ideal and challenging conditions.

My guess is that even a pro would fall without the ABS safety net under sufficient pressure. It's also useful to see honest results of comparative braking distance to fairly weigh the merits of non-ABS against its drawbacks.

Personally, I love my GTR with ABS and wouldn't go back to a street bike without it.

Do pro race bikes have ABS? I'd presume not because weight, controlled conditions, and higher average skill level on the track negate most of the need for it.
