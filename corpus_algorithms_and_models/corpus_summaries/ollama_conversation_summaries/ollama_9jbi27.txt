Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words) by selecting only sentences from the original text exactly as written:

So you all know about the Sunspot Observatory right? Well the FBI shut it down with no explanation about 2 weeks ago, and just recently they said it was because someone had child pornography so it had to be closed to catch/investigate them.

This makes no sense because they completely evacuated the houses and facilities nearby, which is not something that would happen if it was just the child pornography.

Further there were black hawk helicopters circling the site, suggesting there was a more important event occurring.

My theory is that they may have tracked a solar flare or asteroid heading for earth, and are hiding it to prevent panic
