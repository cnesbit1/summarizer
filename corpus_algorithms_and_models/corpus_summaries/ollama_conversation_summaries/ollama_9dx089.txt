Here is the extracted summary:

These past few months have been really really hard. My life at home is really tense and stressful and I started my first year of college a few weeks ago.

Having sex with my boyfriend just like.. doesnt happen. I desperately want to but I havent even been able to masturbate. Like at all. I try and it just doesnt work.

I looked it up and at first I was getting all these result about menopause and how women just dont get horny or anything. But thats bullshit and I wont take that from anyone so I dug a little deeper. Its likely depression and stress and I feel like moving out would change that completely but I cant do that just yet for financial/legal reasons.

1) stop talking to your crazy ass parents.
2) decide whether your boyfriend is helping or hurting.

My boyfriend is very understanding and has never overstepped my boundaries. Hes not forcing me to do anything

Thatâ€™s good! Just keep in mind you never know how someone might be frustrated under the surface.
