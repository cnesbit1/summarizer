The /r/conspiracy mod team is proud of our cohesiveness, and we are proud of our transparency, and this incident called into question both of these mandates.

We have public mod logs for a reason...we had no intention to remove /u/illuminatedwax without first informing the /r/conspiracy community.

Now, much noise has been made about my actions after this bot's alleged mistake, namely that I didn't immediately invite back the rest of the team in the same order.

A similar situation actually arose less than a year ago when ex-mod SarahConnor unilaterally removed the entire mod team except for me and IW. 

While I appreciate SC's passion and believe his intentions were good, that was *not* the way to go about it, especially on a /r/conspiracy sub. 

As a result, getting the mod list back into the proper order required intervention from the reddit admins, and they removed SC as well, as this type of "rogue" moderator behavior is not tolerated, for obvious reasons.

In the meantime, I suddenly found myself as the *only* mod of a 700k-strong sub, and it was approaching midnight my time.
