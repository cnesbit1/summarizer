Here are the extracted sentences:

I have a wife and two kids, and I live really far away from my mom and dad. It's been a few years since I've seen them before today, and so last month my wife made a suggestion that we take a trip down to their house for a surprise visit, which is about 3,000 miles away (we all live in the united states.)

Fast forward about 30 days and finally, we arrived yesterday night at a friends house 20 minutes from my parent's house. At this point they still didn't know we were in their home state.

So my friend, my wife and I all go to the restaurant as soon as it opened while my friends wife watched our kids, because they were still sleeping.

We were at the restaurant for an hour when my parents finally showed up (on time).

My mom started crying and my dad looked happier than ever. We all caught up while eating breakfast and everything was flowing smoothly.

This dragged on for what seemed like an eternity, and my wife and I got into a miniature argument about it.

I heard my dad make a serious-toned comment saying "You two should have never got married." I looked at him and stood up from the table, and said "What the F*ck? Come on! We are trying to get along here!"

He stood up and threatened to fight me so I immediately punched him in the dick.

I feel super bad and wish I could turn back time.
