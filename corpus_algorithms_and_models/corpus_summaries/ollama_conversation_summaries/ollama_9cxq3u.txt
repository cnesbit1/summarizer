Quenneville is an interesting case to me. I still think he's a good coach, but if Crawford comes back and the team is still bad, do you think he goes?

"We just wanted a change of pace-"

"K gonna win a cup over here."

I am somewhat optimistic, though. Q acknowledged that he continued to play a style that didnâ€™t really fly anymore and is more than willing to make big changes to find success again.

If I'm Chicago I'd fire Bowman before Q. He did manage to keep their core intact but at the same time, he's given out about 5-6 very very questionable overpayments, 3 of which are/were crippling salary-wise and seems to be more content on brining in former Hawks in an effort to improve rather than changing up the supplementary pieces around their core.

I wonder how many teams would fire their head coach to hire Quennville? Maybe like 10?

If Q can warm up to new styles of defending and give players more of a chance to prove themselves, things can improve. If he continues doghousing players and not giving guys like Kempny a chance, we'll be fucked.

I'd agree, i think that sort of lumps in with the "bringing back the old core" stuff.
