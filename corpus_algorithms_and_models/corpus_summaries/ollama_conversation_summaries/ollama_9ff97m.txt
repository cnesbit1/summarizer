So I am a 20 year old male, in my first serious relationship, and I am having issues with ejaculating during sex. I cant ejaculate when I have sex with my gf.

At first we thought it was a problem with me masturbating, so I quit all together. Went cold turkey for a couple months and to no avail.

We tried missionary and cowgirl, I dont know if the position really matters.

I can cum from masturbation, just not during sex. I should note, it takes about 25-30 minutes.

For me if I'm not constantly in the moment, or thinking of something sexual, I could go all day without finishing.

Usually thinking about something sex related, whether its my gf and how shes attractive, or some pornstar, literally anything that would be sexual for me. Nothing I think of during sex seems to help.

How long have you been dating this girl, and has this issue only happened with her, or have there been other partners?

We have been dating since the beginning of the year. She is the first person I have been sexual with.

I do enjoy the sex, it feels good, but for some reason it just doesn't make me ejaculate.
