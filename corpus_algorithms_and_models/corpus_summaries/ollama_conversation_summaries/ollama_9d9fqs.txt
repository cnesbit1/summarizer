Edit: I'm interested in LL codes. How many are you looking for? for each...

Sounds good to me... Would you do 9 codes for lvl 100 modest dialga, lvl 60 timid palkia, and lvl 100 modest palkia?

I'll also take KG codes in return for the redeems.

Ok let me know whenever you want to trade. Id be happy to send you the codes first.

And then for redeems... If youd like id be happy to just get rid of all the codes lol. Would you do 18 redeems (6 of each code) for 7 K/G codes and 5 L/L codes?

I could do that, sure. Let me know the details of what you want to be redeemed...

That works...
