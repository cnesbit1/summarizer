Here is the extracted summary:

I left my lights on on my bike and then left it dead overnight. Went to jump it up, and the battery (or something) was obviously toast.

The gauges were fluttering and it wasn't performing well. It was decent at first just had a couple of skips, but it got worse as I rode until it slowed down and completely died.

I went down the road and bought a new battery and it did not fix the problem even after a jump, the bike idles but the dash is still fluttering and when I give it torque it sounds super weak.

The battery connect on the new battery was a little bent, so its either the battery or I messed something up. Any comments?

I drive a 2007 Yamaha YZF600R Thundercat.

If you jumped it from a car, yes, you may have done some damage. Cars are 12v systems, bikes are 6v
