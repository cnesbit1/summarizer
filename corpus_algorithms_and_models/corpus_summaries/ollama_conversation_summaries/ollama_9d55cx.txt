Lack of evidence is what leads to conspiracy theories.

They were identified months ago, it's just being publicised now. Also you can see the guys in cctv leaving the plane from Russia, travelling across London, going to the Skripals home, then leaving the country.

Because they're not trying to convince you. Suspects left the country long before identified so what's the value in letting the opposition know that you know who they are. You'd assume that they'd assume that but why publicise it in case not?
