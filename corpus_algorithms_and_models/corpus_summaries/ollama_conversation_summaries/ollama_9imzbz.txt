Here is the extracted summary:

The local news here (I live in Pittsburgh) was having so much fun with Gritty tonight. They mocked him for a solid ten minutes, then there was a pause, and the sports anchor said “bias aside, I kind of love it” and there was general agreement.

I honestly love it. It's so ridiculous and philly. I'm just glad they didn't go Chad Gnash on us

With that said, I agree completely. It’s ridiculous and fun and everything a mascot should be.

It's so ridiculous and such a bad idea in every way that I enjoy it. That being said, isn't the mascot supposed to be a pilot?

I mean, what else is there to talk about in Pittsburgh.

Again, that all being said, it's so ridiculous that I enjoy it.

Dude, having grown up in London and DC, do you know how lovely it is to live out here now? The news tonight was about a schoolbus that skidded into a ditch because of the rain, Le'veon Bell trade rumors, a few random things about local politics, and then this in the last bit before closing and going to the national news.

Sixers used to have "Phil E Moose" so they should have the "Bull E Bulldog"

I think it makes sense because of the Phanatic like I said...if the phanatic wasn't there it'd make zero sense, but since it's sort of the coke-addled 2nd cousin of the phanatic, it works!

It sounds like you're saying there wasn't anything else to talk about.

exactly, and i love that.
