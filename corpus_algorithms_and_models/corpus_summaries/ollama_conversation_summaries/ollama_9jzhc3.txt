Literally fake and gay.
Why are you using gay as a perjorative? Are you an insecure 12 year old boy?

It's a joke and i turned 13 last week.

If this person is saying literally gay, it seems like they are just stating it’s gay, and if they are saying it’s literally fake, it’s a statement about the quality of the post. I think we are all individually responsible for attaching context to the statement. Personally, it seems like they were making a joke.

I didn't know this was a meme until now and it's still stupid and pointlessly at the expense of gay people.

So you might say it's... Fake and gay.

No. It is literally gay
Yikes
