Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

So long story short- I've been heavily abused and there's all sorts of fun physical and mental things that come from that. My body is numb and I trust people about as far as I can throw them.

Yes I've been to therapy. Yes I've been on medication. It improved my life quite a lot but it plateaued out and now I'm here.

My current BF is an absolute sweetheart. He's caring and responsible and tries to make me happy in any way he can. He's learned new techniques in the bedroom and bought me multiple toys to try and help sex become better for me. Nothing has worked.

I'm just. Numb.

So I called it quits. I can manage on my own and that's good enough for me.

I don't know if this is how it'll be forever, but I already feel far less stressed. On the other hand, I feel far more depressed.
