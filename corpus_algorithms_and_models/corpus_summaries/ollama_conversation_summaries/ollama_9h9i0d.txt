The pubococcygeus muscle or PC muscle is a hammock-like muscle, found in both sexes, that stretches from the pubic bone to the coccyx (tail bone) forming the floor of the pelvic cavity and supporting the pelvic organs.

I was squeezing my PC muscle while inside her multiple times and she never felt that sensation before literally no guy ever did that to her and it made her quiver. So do your f****** kegels men!

Strengthening the PC muscle helps with many things, it even can delay ejaculation if it's strong enough, but most of the time what it does is when you squeeze that muscle it makes your penis move in an upward motion if strong enough.

It's hard to tell you how it feels, but it's like half clenching your butthole but not really and it's mostly like feeling your penis Flex even though your penis isn't really flexing.
