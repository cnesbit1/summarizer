So this happened yesterday.
I had a rugby game yesterday and by half time my contact lenses had fallen out, so I subbed off at half time and while I was watching the second half of the game I was getting annoyed at my blurry vision. 
so i decide to quickly run to my team's changing room to get my glasses to continue to watch the game.
So here I come jogging towards the fence (semi blind) and I think alright ill just quickly jump this fence here and head in and grab my glasses.

TLDR: was going to get my glasses, tried to jump an unlatched gate segment of a fence that was in my path, gate opened landed on my ass, everyone saw, now my right ass cheek hurts like hell.
