I was pro-abortion until my wife became pregnant unexpectedly. Now I have three kids and have changed my perspective.

If someone watches an undercover video of Planned Parenthood performing an abortion, and they're still pro-abortion, then they have a disconnect with life. The baby's heart starts beating, making it a separate viable human being.

I'm okay with morning-after pills or terminating pregnancies within 30 days. However, once the baby's heart starts beating, it's no longer just about the woman's body - it's also the baby's body.

Some people think that if a hospital got someone pregnant, then they should be forced to carry the child. I disagree. It's not about the hospital; it's about individuals' rights to control their own bodies.

It baffles me when parents say they're pro-abortion. How can someone watch an undercover video of Planned Parenthood and still support abortion?

I think that people who are raped or have other circumstances should take responsibility for themselves, such as using a morning-after pill or terminating the pregnancy within 30 days. There's no excuse for irresponsibility.

Some people might not agree with me, but I believe that every life has value and deserves to be protected.
