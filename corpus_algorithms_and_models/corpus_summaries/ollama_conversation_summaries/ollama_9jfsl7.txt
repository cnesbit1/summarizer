* "Your wife is not only raping you but also insulting you and shit? I'm not one to quickly jump on the 'leave her/him' train because we're only getting a snapshot of your life, but dude. This snapshot is looking like you shouldn't be sticking around."
* "When i refuse sex, she starts to cry, and says 'am i not beautiful' or 'do i not turn you on' or 'you know how many times my best friend and her husband do it' or 'you know many guys wish to be in your spot'... And she wants it everyday, most of the times twice even..."
* "I didn't say it was the best thing. Just one of the most important."
* "Well just imagine for a sec that your gf had said no to sex before you went to bed. And your sex life wasn't the greatest. And _then_ you fuck her in her sleep, and she wakes up upset. Is it still ok?"
* "Sleep sex is something I've always discussed with my partners. Because if you do it to someone that isn't ok with it, that's a bad thing."
* "A good partner would never use this against a partner if there's been an argument or something though. 'but you said it was ok?' You should simply know that the no just before bed still means no until argument is done with."
* "Yeah I don't have a lot of experience with different partners but I can say that even if your line of communication is 100% open awkward situations are still unavoidable."
* "If at all unsure if the partner is into what's going on, I'd just stop unless they absolutely insist on being fine."
* "I feel like this stuff shouldn't be that difficult if you have an ounce of empathy and wish for your partner to have a good time, rather than to just focus on own pleasure kind of thing.."
* "Well if you really really put on your best effort to convince your guy you're ok with everything, you can't claim rape after that."
* "It's just how I do it. It works for me."
