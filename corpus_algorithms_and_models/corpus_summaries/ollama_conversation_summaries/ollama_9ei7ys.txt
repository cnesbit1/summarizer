Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.

You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.

Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,

Sins against nature, therefore, like the sin of Sodom, are abominable and deserve punishment whenever and wherever they are committed.

"All other frenzies of lusts which exceed the laws of nature and are impious toward both bodies and the sexes we banish â€¦ from all shelter of the Church, for they are not sins so much as monstrosities."

Tertullian - De pudicitia
