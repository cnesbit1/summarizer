Unpopular opinion but Bettman is one of the better commissioners in NHL history.

You can bring up lockouts but the league came back stronger after each one.

The league is far better than it was when he took over.

He also eats up the booing which is hilarious.

It’s also not his fault hockey has out priced itself in Canada.

Hockey is a prohibitively expensive sport. Full stop.

This is Canada we’re talking about too, not Florida.

There are more hockey fans and participants than there were 25 years ago and I'm fairly certain those numbers outpace general population growth in most areas.

Staying on topic: Bettman isn't responsible for the state of hockey or what equipment manufacturers do. He's responsible solely to the NHL and its owners.

I disagree. If other sports leagues are growing more quickly, then that means NHL growth is underperforming.

He is because he never regulated the technology overload that every sport did.

That becomes the standard because sport regulations are almost always top down.
