Here is the extracted summary:

What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."

The United States is not Israel, Canada is not Israel, Brazil is not Israel, Germany is not Israel, France is not Israel, There is only one Israel and it's the nation it is today.

This is fine - I think murder should be a crime punishable by death. This is not fine: I think homosexual acts should be a crime punishable by death.

We all deserve death. Everyone does, for we've all sinned, and the wages of sin is death. Praise God, He offers us better than we deserve.

Now, there was one point on Earth when God set up a specific government with rules telling people to punish some sins in some certain ways. That was ancient Israel; the rules are part of the Law of Moses. That has since passed away.

This is predicated on the assumption that the argument made was for the death penalty, not for some extra judicial killing. It's a bit difficult when comments are removed so we have to discuss in the abstract.

You and I may think there is a difference between murder and homosexual acts. Many do not.
