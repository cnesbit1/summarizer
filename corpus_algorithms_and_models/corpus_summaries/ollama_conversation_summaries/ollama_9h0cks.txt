You did create a straw man brah, own up.       "Gotcha, so one can create a complete fantasy and believe in it without any evidence"

It's not a tactic.  Finding the truth has nothing to do with imagination and has everything to do with evidenced facts.  I'm simply pointing this out.  Nothing more.
