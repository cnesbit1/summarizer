Don’t get me wrong. I appreciate what they’re doing, but the hosts are usually so cringe-worthy that it’s hard to listen to. It’s like listening to preschool teachers. Can’t they keep it clean without it having to sound so fake and, well, just down right lame?

So often I hear them make some horrible cringe-worthy joke and then they all fake laugh about it like it was sooo funny, but the laughs are even cringy and fake sounding.

I just feel like they’re so disconnected from reality when on the air that it’s even caused me to struggle in the past with whether or not I belong in this church culture. Can’t they at least act real?

Poor theology is also common amongst them.
It’s typically what’s known as a theology of glory, where being a Christian means life will generally be happy and carefree.

Smile cause you just got away with something? Is this how we should view grace?
