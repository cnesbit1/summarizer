I’ve only known this guy for like two weeks and we decided to have casual sex and all of the sudden out of no where with out asking he dead ass tries to suffocate me??!

That guys an asshole, you're entitled to feel rage towards him.

Assault for a damn blowjob? Assault for trying to suffocate the OP. Read the original post, without consultation this guy tried to suffocate the OP and that is assault. It's nothing to do with the blow job.

Real BDSM involves confirming that your sex partner is ok with you doing specific acts before doing them. Outside of that circumstance what the guy did is assault.

All I'm saying is if you press charges for that you're a dick.

It depends on the person. Not all the same. Doesn’t make them a dick. They could be a dick but that has a lot more to do with the motivation for why they would pursue legal action vs the fact of pursuing it in of itself.

Assault is assault whether public or private, stranger or lover, a big deal to you or not. You don’t get a high five for doing it and receiving it is not great either. Generally why there are consequences for it.
