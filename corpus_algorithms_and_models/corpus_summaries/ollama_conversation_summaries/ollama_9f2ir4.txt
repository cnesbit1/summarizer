This happened a few months ago, but I still think about it every time I walk by.

I went to Walgreen's to buy Plan B with my boyfriend. The lady at the register grabbed some scissors and offered to open it for me right there so that I could take it with my water bottle.

The Walgreens is in a pretty rough part of town, so I wonder if she has seen girls come in, in much more dire situations.
