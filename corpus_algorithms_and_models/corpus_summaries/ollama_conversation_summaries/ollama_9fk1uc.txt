Here is the summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

We have been married for almost 4 years. And and a few years ago he began making weird comments about our sex life. I’m not all that sexually experienced and he’s told me that he likes noises during sex (anything from soft moaning to screaming) because he’s thinks it’s sexy. So I obliged.

So now when we’re having sex I don’t do or say anything for fear of what he’s going to say. Now I don’t know how to fix it. And he’ll sometimes say he’s joking but it’s not funny. It’s hurtful.

You tried to please him and after a while the way he reacted started to hurt you even though you were trying to please him.

Do it in front of the counselor because he may dismiss it at home but you bringing it up there means he can't back away, and he has to explain himself.

For all you know he may be teasing you and unintentionally hurting your feelings.
