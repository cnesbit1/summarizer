Your doors don't open from the inside without a key? Do you live in an old medieval castle with a bunch of large iron keys on a big metal ring?

Anyone going outside would lock door if they don't want to disturb people inside home since they have a key inside to open the door.

Door could have a deadlock (or deadbolt), which canâ€™t be moved into the open position without a key.

Most of Europe does it that way.

Is there a keyhole on both sides of the lock? I'm so confused.

If you have a door that has window panes or sidelights, then you would typically have a lock that requires a key on the inside, to prevent someone from unlocking it through a busted window.

It's called having a keyhole on both sides, what do you have on the inside of your door?

More developed countries than Europe? LoL

Yeah everyone has that but don't you have an actual lock? Like a longer bolt that goes from the door into the wall when you close your door if you turn the key?

In America, most of our door locks look something like [this.](https://www.directdoorhardware.com/assets/images/weslock/deadbolts/272.jpg)

Honestly I never had issues with double deadbolts, you leave the key in the bolt when you are home so you can easily open and close it.

If someone is willing to break a window they are just as able to break a door.

Hmm yeah that's called something else here in Europe, that's the extra security you have like a second lock. But the primary lock is keyholes on both sides
