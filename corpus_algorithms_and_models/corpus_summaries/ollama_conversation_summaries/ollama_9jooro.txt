Here is the summary you requested:

Tons of comments denying the genocide and almost complete opposition to bringing them in.

Seems like you guys just want to shit on the government and not actually solve this issue

We are not the World Refugee Police. We have no responsibility to solve an issue on the other side of the planet.

I dealt with multiple actual genocide deniers in multiple threads on the issue.

Well maybe when he doesn’t act like a complete idiot and does something Prime Ministerial, he won’t get shit on.

That’s false. They have every intention of making a deal, just a worse one now. What about Saudi Arabia? India? How did that go?

Saudi Arabia are overreacting babies.

India? An embarrassing trip, yes. Didn’t harm our relationship with the country, just made him look a little foolish.

Sadly a lot of Canadians only want immigrants that are both white and non-Muslim. Whether or not the accept it, this is the reality. It also turns out that many of them frequent this subreddit.
