Here is the summary:

I may lost my virginity soon, heard that the first time he supposed to thrust slowly. Logically I cannot find any reason he cannot thrust fast.

What will happen to me if he thrust fast? Anything to do with my hymen?

Not necessarily. I’ve had regular sex for 10 years and it can still hurt me just depending on how it’s done.

Thanks. Do you mean that during the first penetration, the pain will follow when he goes deeper and deeper? Anything to do with size?

I can’t tell you what it’s going to feel like only what it *could* feel like.

Then yeah I’d recommend going slow and have lube on hand in case you do not get wet enough or start to dry out. Make sure to have plenty of foreplay.

If there is, tell him to stop. You can absolutely stop it if you feel pain or are uncomfortable. Please don’t be afraid to do so.

It's so nice that you took the time to be so kind and patient while replying but I'm pretty certain this is just a troll account and sadly, probably some weirdo with a virgin fetish or something.
