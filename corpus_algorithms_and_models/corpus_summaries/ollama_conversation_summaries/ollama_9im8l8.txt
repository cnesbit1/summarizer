Sometimes I feel like the only Grom rider who uses the bike for short commutes and casual cruising, instead of fuck boy shenanigan. There isn't many of us, but we do exist :) My girlfriend just picked up a TNT 135 and riding it makes me itch to be a hooligan.... Even more so than my fz-09

Not entirely, mine is my only bike so it does everything but it's mostly getting to work and back. Weekends are often a bit more colourful, but at worst I speed too much. My other riding buddies are not sane, to say the least.

Fellow Grom commuters unite! Tip of the helmet to all sane riders out there. Mine is built for speed!  Not a lot of speed but some of it.

I skipped around that video and watched without sound.  I don't see anything wrong short of it being a dude on a Grom.  If you come up on a long line of bikes and you're faster, pass them.
