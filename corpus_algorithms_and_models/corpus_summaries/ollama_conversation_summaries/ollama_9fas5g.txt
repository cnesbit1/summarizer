My best friend committed suicide on Sunday and he accepted Jesus christ and he loved him.. But, I'm worried that when I go up to Heaven will I see him? I mean.. Does that mean if you committed suicide do you go to hell. I'm not going to committed suicide, I love my life. But, can Jesus forgive him?? Or?

No matter the context, the answer to "Can Jesus forgive him?" is yes.

Sin, in the new testament, is not considered a tally mark against you, but rather a state of being. So the point of that statement is that while one is in that state, there is no forgiveness.

Judas Iscariot took his own life after betraying Jesus.
Saul killed himself in order to not be caught by the enemy.

You can forgive them while still giving someone the freedom to choose.
