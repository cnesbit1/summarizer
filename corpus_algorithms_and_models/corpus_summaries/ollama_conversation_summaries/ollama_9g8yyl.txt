So I've decided it's time to complete my collection of breedables properly. I.e. get a copy of each in as good a matching ball as possible, with max egg moves and Hidden Ability.

Essentially anything highlighted in yellow is a thing I'm missing of that specific mon.

For example; 
* **Seel** over there has his picture and name in white, meaning I already have a Seel, 
* However the HA and premier ball are highlighted yellow, meaning the Seel I do have is lacking these traits
* You'll notice too that in the egg moves column, Fake Out is white whilst the others yellow. I.e My current Seel has Fake Out but not the other egg moves

Hiya, Taco!  
Alrighty, so [here's](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119Rd1HsajQlU17mX5YFoMxtSF9y4r0x7m3_xgKS2rA0/edit?usp=sharing) my good ol' spreadsheet.

I can breed on any missing EMs. If they have USUM exclusive Egg Moves, I'll prioritise breeding those on :)
