Here is the summary:

You couldn't find 2 more different bikes to compare. Do you want an upright bike you can mess around with on all kinds of terrain, or street only? A fun hooligan bike, or a track day weapon?

Forget about flat footing. Can you tip toe it? I never flat foot, always left foot off the peg and on the ground once I'm in first gear and right leg on the rear brake.

I'm 5'9" and I ride my DRZ around no problem. You'll be fine at 6ft.

An R6 is one of the worst possible around town bikes. Out of sport bikes, it, and the R1, are probably the most aggressive. They are track weapons, much more so than anything else.

Well in my area, that would be a much more expensive bike.

DRZ SM can be tough to find for reasonable money with any kind of mods and that one has some good ones.

Drz all the way then

Oh my god, so much so! A FAST supermoto is still like a reasonably slow regular road bike haha.
