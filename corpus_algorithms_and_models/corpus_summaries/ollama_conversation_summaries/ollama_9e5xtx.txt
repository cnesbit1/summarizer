Here is the extracted summary of up to 250 words:

Non-Canadians shouldn't be getting all the benefits that Canadians have paid into. This just encourages people to enter the country illegally.
Even those ones who pay taxes?
No. If they want Canadian benefits with the taxes that they pay, let them attain Canadian PR.

They're getting way more from Canada than they pay in taxes anyway.

Canadians are starting to turn against immigration. Let's not speed up that process.

Whoa, whoa, hold on. Permanent Residents are non-Canadians too. I actually meant them in the first place.
You're comparing honest people that went through a formal process to people that entered illegally.

Don't move the goalposts please.

That is another debate currently ongoing. Being born in Canada also shouldn't guarantee you citizenship automatically from an immigrating family.

The title of the post even says "non-permanent". Permanent residents should qualify as well as natural citizens.

Just in the case of this university, international students should be paying far more than natural citizens or permanent residents for tuition *and* healthcare in order to subsidize our system in favour of Canadians who are already here and may need care sooner.
