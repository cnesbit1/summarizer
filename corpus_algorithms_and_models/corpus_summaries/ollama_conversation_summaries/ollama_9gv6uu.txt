And my soul is crushed. How could i not see this? How could i be so stupid to believe the late nights and work trips and every strange thing he did i passed it off as my being paranoid and possesive.

How do you do that? How do you live a double life for two and a half years. How did she not notice? How could he ruin so many peoples lives

Most of all why do i hate him but still love him. I know he is not him. Not the man i loved. That man was made up. A lie, all of it fake.

Id never loved anybody every day for so long more each day. It was like i was finally happy. And it wasnt even real? Like a movie you watch where you fall in love with the character and then the movie ends and you just have to figure out how to feel real emotions again.

Holy freaking crap you guys. 2.5 years. I put every peice together.
