No really. Even though I have very little in common with Bernier's political values, he is representing some very distinct viewpoints that are perfectly valid and, previously hadn't been meaningfully represented on the political stage.

I get what you're saying, but Alex Jones is a literal crazy person, so it's a bit hyperbolic to compare Bernier to him. If Bernier's spinning a yarn, at least it's a believable one.

We'll have to wait and see if Bernier is really selling what he's pitching, but if he's being genuine, it's a *good thing* for Canadian politics because it encourages growth and divergence rather than stagnation.

Alex Jones has never called himself that, he attacks Classical Liberals with his BS.

The Editor in Chief of Infowars Paul Joseph Watson Trump supporting,  far right in policy labels himself a "classical liberal".

Paul Ryan also calls himself a classical liberal.

Ok. So the mainstream right wing anti-government slash welfare privatize healthcare politics of Republican Party before Trump is classical liberalism?

It's marketing because the word "liberal" sounds less threatening than "libertarian."

How is it stupid? It's what "Liberal" used to mean a century ago or more until the modern left-wing Liberals appropriated the term and now it means the opposite on many positions.
