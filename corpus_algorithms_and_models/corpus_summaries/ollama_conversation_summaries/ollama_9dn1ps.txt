Here is the extracted summary:

Translated: Evangelicals, please stop supporting the Republicans so we can take power back again!

Signed,  The Liberals
Please be consistent in your beliefs. If you have ever whined about gays and not wanting them in power because you see them as immoral why would you want trump in power (adulterer, lover of money, gossips, doesn't read the bible, go to church, grabs women sexually, etc).

You want to know why so many don't believe anymore? Because people like me woke up to the realization that Christians act all moral, preach about being moral, and then ditch all of that for one old man.

If you really don't believe in your god and morals, why would anyone else?

So go peddle your high toned moral platitudes elsewhere, we've had enough of them here.

And shame on anyone for using a Christian forum to sell a political viewpoint.

Keep making America great.

Are you illiterate or just willfully ignorant?

Either way, Iâ€™m unsurprised.

You spout drivel for hours and demand explanations from others? You come to Christian forum and use words like "s**t" and "fellate" and expect to be taken seriously?
