Hey, guys.

To start with, I love wine! Unfortunately, I'm also a bit of a lightweight.

Drinking excessively is a sin, right? There are verses that would argue against that, too, right?

I've came across the argument that Jesus' first miracle was turning water into wine at a wedding in Cana. Could it be said that there were people at the wedding who were most likely drunk to begin with? With it being a celebration, of course.

This is what lead to me second guessing. Knowing my limits, I can get drunk fairly easy. One glass of wine can slam me.

I don't want to do something displeasing.

You shouldn't aim to drink until your intoxicated. But having an alcoholic drink is generally an okay thing to do but it will also depend on the situation you're in.

You need to know your limits and not drink beyond them.

If while you're staying with your dad he opens a bottle and offers you a glass then there's no obligation to finish the bottle.
