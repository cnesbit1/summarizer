Here is the summary:

I'm more upset about the fact he maintained communications with this stranger long enough to divulge about his past divorce, current relationship, and gave her the idea she could even seduce him in the first place.

That sounds more like he was getting close to a friend, and then from your main post it appears that when she started pushing for more he blocked her. What more do you want? Do you want him to give up having friends?

Yes, perhaps him seeking a "thanks" is a bit much but when most of the time you hear about people cheating on their partner and hiding it, it can be refreshing to know he had the chance to and didn't.

Would you rather he didn't tell you about women trying to seduce him away from you?

Tell him that not cheating is fuckin compulsory for a committed relationship, sorry no gold stars here, and how your felt about him texting this chick.
