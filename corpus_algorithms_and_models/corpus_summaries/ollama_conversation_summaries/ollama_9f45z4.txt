* Never had it happen (also never been with a mother before), but it probably wouldn't bother me. At least that's a fluid that is actually intended to go in a mouth, unlike most others involved in sex.
* Don't have to be a mother in order to lactate. Stimulation over time can cause a woman who never gave birth to lactate.
* Induced lactation. Some people do it for sexual/fetish reasons but it's usually intended for adoptive mothers who are getting newborns and want to breastfeed.
* There are also circumstances whereby men can be [induced to lactate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/).
* Just for the sake of insight, for a lot of women it’s not even just that they don’t see their breasts as sexual (although that’s very common too) it’s that they’re feeling overtouched.
* I LOVE cuddling and being touched all the time, except when I’m nursing 24/7.  I just get “touched out” and can’t stand to have anyone else on me.
* It’s so exhausting! We’re currently trying for a second and I’m so scared of how tiring it is to to be so physically needed by everyone (including our 2 dogs).
