But doesn't an unregulated free market inevitably lead to monopolies? Yes. Hence the game Monopoly.

Regulations don't prevent monopolies. If they did, Canada would have concepts of choice.

Oligopolies aren't a fair trade off. But ignore that we need larger and bigger governments to tell people to stop buying tickets from ticket master.

Everyone else does thus business as usual. All everyone had to do was boycott them but they have no discipline and can't fathom sacrifice so they throw money at it like they have to, life or death, and bitch about it.

Not really. If a company is approaching monopoly status, and raising prices to take advantage of that, it increases the incentive for other parties to enter the market.

That's actually incorrect. There are stable and unstable Monopoly equilibria.
