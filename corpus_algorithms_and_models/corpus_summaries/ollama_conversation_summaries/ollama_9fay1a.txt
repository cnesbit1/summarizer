Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

He has many other girls on his Instagram he follows and the ones he doesn’t follow back are either gay or not pretty.
You have a very good point there. I guess since they look all sexy I assume he messed with them too lol. Just there is so few pretty girls he unfollwed. Most of them are either gay or aren’t that pretty
He can’t get “pretty” girls then, men don’t just fuck every girl they follow on instagram, I follow a lot of friends / girls I know and I have a gf
I actually didn’t mean anything, just like I later explained, no one fucks EVERY person they follow on instagram
But someone said this :(. My content wasn’t sexy for him :)
Having a gf does not mean unfollow EVERY girl you have EVER met Just the ones that are a danger to him.
I 100% disagree and I think their answer is honestly stupid and dilussional.
