And the best reality TV show, Terrace House
Yup first season is the best and has the most drama though it kind of fizzled near the end.
Like yama say, most of the cast of Aloha are not even human.

Boys and girls in the city and the latest one, Opening new doors are must watch.
Aloha state is just too much unneeded drama but it still has their moments i.e LAURENNN and basically anything with guy.

Also Hansan x Arman is the best.
Oh Boy and Girl next door ... *CoughVPNandfansub*

Anything/anyone x Arman is the best
Watching BGITC now but I finished Aloha State first.
