And he's so sure he's in the right that he uploaded the video to show the world "what a bitch she is". Terrible.

I'm most sad about the kid sitting next to her who had to witness some complete shitface of a motorcyclist go off at his mom like that.
Actually, video description states its not OPs video and proceeds to basically snitch on the rider. The title definitely threw me for a loop though

Yeha, not sure Eraesr understands that, but the original person *did* upload this, probably thinking he was in the right and he'd be supported. OP then saved it because he knew it'd get deleted after the obvious shitstorm, and reposted it.

I do my share of things I probably shouldn't on the road, but being a confrontational asshole like this after blatantly passing on double yellows just reflects poorly on all of us. And to a mother with her child in the car to boot.

Fuck riders like this.

Can you link this video? I missed it.
