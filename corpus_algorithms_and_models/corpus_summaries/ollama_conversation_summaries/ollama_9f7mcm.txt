Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Not sexual assualt but definitely poor communication. Consent is important. Ask for a verbal yes, that one word can save so much confusion and hurt feelings later.

so he can just go ahead and try to stick it in?

Escalation of sexual behavior is what happens when two people take off their clothes and make out. If they are both sober and no boundaries have been set then I don't see how trying to have sex with your fwb is sexual assault.

He knew she didn't want him to do that.

I don't think he explicitly knew I didn't want to do it, cause I never said it.

He was indeed immature by not asking for consent before doing something he knew she didn't want and then lying to about it.

You both needed to communicate better.

So telling someone you want to have sex with them, then taking off your clothes while making out sober isn't implied consent?

The very short answer is no.
