If that armor is battle-tested and up to the standard of Medieval warfare, not really. He could certainly use some gloves and a DOT-approved helmet but that shit is literally meant to do its best to keep someone alive after they've received a lance blow and been knocked off their horse at high speeds.

I doubt if medieval style armour is as effective at impact absorption as modern gear.
I'm not so bold that I would make the claim that we've not made any advances in the realm of falling off of things at high speeds, my main point is that he would not suffer and end-all fate from a fall.
Knocked off their horse at 100km/h.

It's not like DOT actually inspects helmets themselves.
Pretty much, yeah. The American-based NHTSA publishes the DOT standards and helmet makers must self-certify.

I love my GW250, dude! I got it super cheap at the dealership for $2000 brand-new after all the dealer fees and I've taken it all the way out to the Blue Ridge Parkway. Absolute blast of a bike and I will miss it when I do eventually sell it.
