Here is a summary of up to 250 words:

The literal act of having sex doesn't arouse me at all. Like my body might respond to what's happening but my mind doesn't and therefore having an orgasm with someone is impossible. I really try to tell myself that it's fine and I try to see sex as a more emotionally-exhaustive thing but it really gets to me sometimes... and honestly I don't even see the point in trying to explore things with my boyfriend because I feel like a lost cause? Sex is about as mundane to me as writing an essay.

I don't think I'm asexual because I do desire sex and experience sexual attraction and have sexual feelings, but I just don't get anything out of it. It's always been like this for me and I have no idea how to change that.

Are you on any medications (such as those for depression or birth control). They can kill libido, as well as desensitize areas like your nipples and clit.

I've been on some form of hormonal birth control since I was about 14/15.
