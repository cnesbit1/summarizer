Here is the summary:

Hey guys, I’m really excited because I’m getting my first bike in a couple days. The deal is already sealed, I just have to get the paperwork sorted.

I don't care about the opinions of people who try and make something less fun for others.

The irony in the whole "girl's bike" thing is that XLs are more top-heavy than Big Twins, making them actually harder for a smaller and weaker person to handle at low speeds. This trait is really evident in Ironheads.

There's a lot of different Sportster models, which one is it? All of the Sportsters have the same core but the factory remixes the wheels, shocks, and finishes to make different models.

I ride a Kawasaki N400 and get this all the damn time, even by people who don't ride. I used to explain that I'm perfectly happy with my bike but now I just say "haha yeah..." and move on with my day.

What is the Iron Butt rally? Is it a long distance ride or something?

All Sportsters have the model designation XL as far as I know. The Iron Butt Rally is a distance riding event where a traffic citation is an automatic DQ and points are awarded for arriving at designated checkpoints on time and riding to various destinations (with photographic proof).
