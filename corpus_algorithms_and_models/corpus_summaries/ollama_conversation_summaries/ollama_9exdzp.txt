Here is the extracted summary of about 10% of the original text:

1) Homosexuality: To be more specific: How can we love gays, regardless of whether we affirm it or reject it.

2) New Perspective on Paul. I personally had always suspected that historically Christians have forgotten how Jewish the Pauline Epistles were.

3) God's goodness. Whenever I hear John Piper speak of God's sovereignty apart from God's goodness (e.g. saying that God is glorified when people are predestined for hell and are burnt in hell forever for his glory), I frankly want to puke, even though the rest of his theology is pretty darn good.

4) How God's justice relates to God's mercy. (e.g. does God's mercy means we don't seek God's justice, e.g. when someone is raped and she forgives the rapist, does this means she doesn't seek justice?)

Fair enough.
I've always compared it to how I'm a Christian and I have atheist friends who say stuff like "all religious people are mentally damaged" or "Religion is the root of so much violence in the world, we should just lock them up and stamp it out (except you /u/CharlesComm, you're the exception)".

So, I'm curious: let's say we have a white nationalist who *genuinely* believes non-white people would be better off leaving the country. Would preaching that from the street corner be loving?

Sticking with your metaphor, if a person truly wishes and hopes for the best for both myself and my child, and sincerely believes that the act of adoption is acting against our best interests, I would still consider them loving.

Just as with all people we love we want them not to take actions, or live in a way, that is ultimately damaging to them as a person.
