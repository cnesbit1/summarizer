Here is the extracted summary:

Based on last year can I say Ovechkin? The sheer will and drive to win the cup put him above the speed and skill of McDavid, and above the elite hockey iq of Crosby.

In a vacuum I think McDavid has either surpassed or will pass Crosby this year, it’s close.

Ovi is absolutely not better than McDavid or Crosby lol

No, based on last year you can't say Ovechkin. Unless you're a delusional caps fan who is tripping LSD

Did Kuznetsov not have a sheer will and drive to win the cup (and outscore Ovi in the playoffs)?

That's interesting, because I'm quite sure Ovi won the Rocket Richard trophy as the league’s leading goal scorer.

You don't watch McDavid if that's what you think.
