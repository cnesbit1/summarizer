Here is the extracted summary:

The first iteration of the game is still running so take a wild guess :).
yes, first iteration would be the first game they (developers) made.
I wouldn't use the word "iteration" when talking about a sequel, at least not when the games are as wildly different as GW1 and GW2. For something like Counter Strike, maybe.
You do you.
As I said, you do you.
eh just googling the word
would gw2 qualify as a new version of gw1 if the engine the world and the lore are reused?
Lol, GW2 is not a new version of GW1, it's completely different. Sure, the engine is based on GW1's, but saying they're "the same" is like saying that a car is the same after you've replaced everything but the chassis.
A new iteration of something, anything by definition makes it different. For a guy using a dictionary you aren't very sharp.
Yes.
are you retarded?
Youre a waste of oxygen
Even if they did, what does that have to do with my analogy? It's not the same car if you replace everything but one component, regardless of what you call it. God you're so dumb it hurts.
That said, it would have been better to have just said "Guild Wars 1 is still running 14yrs later so I'm pretty sure Guild Wars 2 will last another 4-5yrs", or something like that.
