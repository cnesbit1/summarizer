Here is the summary:

If he doesn't care about net neutrality and wants to put us of the mercy of ISP's, that's worse than inviting 2 million immigrants a year into this country.

Many people have been freaking out about net neutrality but with the US as an example I haven't heard of ISPs charging ridiculous rates for case by case website access. Maybe it could happen but in practice it doesn't appear to be as severe as what was being ranted and raved about on reddit the past couple years.

Yeah I think as long as theres good competition, ISPs will have incentive to not restrict internet.

Pretty sure Canada is already one of the harder countries in the world to immigrate to due to our selection process.. What these "nationalists" really want is race based selection and to stop taking refugees in.
