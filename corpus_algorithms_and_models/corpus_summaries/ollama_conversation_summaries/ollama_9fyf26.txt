Here are the selected sentences:

We all have the human right to freedom of informed medical consent.

However this right is violated in 40% of EU countries which impose mandatory vaccination under threat of fines or imprisonment.

Mandatory vaccination in the UK was attempted first in the 19th century. The legislation was ineffective, discriminated in favour of those able to use the exemptions, and was divisive; it fostered substantial anti-vaccine sentiment and was counterproductive.
