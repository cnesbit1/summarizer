Holy jumpin!!!
Get outta here panger
The Wings broadcaster Mickey Redmond also says holy jumpin. Miss me with that Blues shit. (JK; I do like Panger but was explaining why OP likely said that since this is a Wings draft pick.)

I can't wait to hear Mick's voice again today.  The Tigers announcers had a physical altercation this week because they hate each other, we're lucky with the Ken &amp; Mickey duo that carries us.

Ken and Mickey are legit best pals too. When Kens son passed away Mickey was the first person to call him.

He doesn't want to live in the Congo?
