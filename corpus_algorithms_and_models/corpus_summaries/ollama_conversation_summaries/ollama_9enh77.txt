I've been depressed ever since high school along with heaps of anxiety inherited from mom. In college I'd be perpetually fatigued but I just chalked it up to being so busy. Then I graduated and I. Kept. Sleeping. 12 hours, 15 hours, I'd sleep and sleep and sleep. I brushed it off though because I figured I had a sleep debt to repay.

Then I began to finally tackle the 10 pounds I gained in college. And as I counted my calories I noticed something odd. To lose weight I had to eat 1,000 calories a day or less. This is with daily moderate exercise. My weight is maintained with the same exercise on 1,300 calories max. No more.

Then after a month of traveling in China I got back and my sleep deteriorated entirely and my depression kicked up to the point where I'd be crying miserably while feeling so fatigued I couldn't move.

So when I met my new doctor (I just aged out of my pediatric doctor) I told her everything and she listened. She felt my thyroid and said she thinks it is normal. But she submitted to the lab tests for vitamin D, a basic thyroid panel , other basic panels, and even anemia.

My results came back 24 hours later. My TSH levels were extremely high. The lab called me and said I need to go back ASAP for further testing.
