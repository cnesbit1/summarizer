If a man had such large tits that it resembled some B-cup girl then, as a manager, I'd ask that he at least wear an undershirt.
That wasn't the issue, the issue in the above comment was nipples visible through a shirt. And the other issue is that while women are told to make nipples not visible men are not because men's nipples are not sexualised by society.
You are being obtuse on purpose.
Why? Get over it.
