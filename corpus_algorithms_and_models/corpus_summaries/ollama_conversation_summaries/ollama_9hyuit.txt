Canberra block 105 coffeeshop, malay auntie sell superb bagus curry potato puffs and sardine puffs at $1.20 each. Big and well stuffed, very nice. Used to operate at old Woodland bus interchange but relocated. If you stay around the area can come buy, super worth it.

I see so many people who love curry puffs and idk why

The best kind of curry puff is the type with thin and slightly crispy skin, usually sold by mamak shops and malay snack or food stalls.

curry puffs are our cornish pasties, i low ses so i love them a lot

I like the flaky flaky kind that crumbles when you bite into it, I don't mind those.
