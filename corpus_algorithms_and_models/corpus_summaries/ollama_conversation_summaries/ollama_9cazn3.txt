Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

My instinct was to spit out my coffee, but then I checked. He has 607 goals in 1003 games played. He needs about 300 more goals.

If he can score 50 goals a season into age 37/38 he can do it.

It's too bad what would've been his first year was lost to the lockout or else he'd have probably 50+ more goals to his name and the record would definitely be more easily attainable.

Ovechkin has played in one of the toughest times to score goals, if he breaks the career record he's definitely the undisputed best goal scorer ever.

Right? What a waste of time lol

Not to mention the lockout shortened season (could be another 20 there) and the times he was made to play more D, that could be another 20-30 there for all we know. I still think he can get it if he plays into his 40s.

He's already pretty close to being the undisputed best goal scorer ever.

Ovechkin is one of only four players to score 50 multiple times from 05/06 to today, and the only one to do it more than twice (he's done it seven times).
