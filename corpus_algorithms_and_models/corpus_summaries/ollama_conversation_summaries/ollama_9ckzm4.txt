Here is the summary:

Just got my first bike, woo. What kind of helmet should I get? I wanted one that just goes over the top with an open front. But then I saw a post of a guy skidding down a highway and thanking his helmet. So maybe I should get a full face helmet? Can you guys recommend what kind to buy. Don't care how cool it is, I want to be safe. But I also want to look cool. Whatever you tell me to buy, I'll probably buy. I'm at your mercy. Thank you.

I am a strong supporter of full-face helmets. I can tell you what to look for in a good, safe helmet. First, the shell should be made of fiberglass, carbon, carbon fiber or some combination of the three...

Yes, Revzilla a reputable store. I do recommend going to a physical store for your helmet though unless you know what size you are and the shape of your head.

Stay away from protection gear from the HD store online. Find something with a Snell rating. Even if a store is a bit out of the way go get fitted for a helmet that way you know your size and can buy it online
