jeeeesus. it's for the best. riding my bike to work made me hate riding.

Only accidents I've had in 3 years of riding in NYC were from bumping someones rear end after someone in a land Rover blitzed down the bicycle lane doing 40 (had to get over a few feet FAST), and dumping the bike once at slow speed when an older pedestrian walked right out in front of me. No injuries, luckily.

Learned to ride in Mexico City. Yup, big city mad traffic does wonders on your reaction times for pretty much all scenarios.

I feel like, like this has a massively huge chance of blowing up completely.

"Uh.. no.  I commute by a totally different route - I never use that highway!”  
  
“But I never mentioned which road it happened on.”  
  
“......  shit!”

I feel like it would be a more positive income if people fell in love instead of suing each other SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING WITH
