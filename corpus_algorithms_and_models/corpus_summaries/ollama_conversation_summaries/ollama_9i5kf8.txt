I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. -John 14:6

So only Jesus is the truth. Not us. He is the only way to eternal life because only His sacrifice paid for our sins.

Then Jesus specifically gave us a template on how to pray in Matthew 6 with the “Our Father”.

Prayer is powerful. Really great stuff once you are in a personal relationship with Jesus.

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. -John 3:16

All we have to do is accept God’s gift that was Jesus’s death on the cross for our sins and he will accept us without a question into heaven.

Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.  Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. -James 1:2-4
