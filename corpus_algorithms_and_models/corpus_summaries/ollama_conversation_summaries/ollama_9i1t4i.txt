Here is the summary:

At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now what do you say?”

Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.

Most people feel judged when they are told something they did is wrong.

Looking down on other people is not necessarily a Christian thing. Everyone does it.

I think that it's okay for us as Christians to say something is a sin but I'd say judging a person or being judgemental is completely different.

That's not what they mean, and I think you know it.

Being judgmental means looking down on other people.

Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.

Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
