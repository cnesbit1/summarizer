Hey, I have a self obtained Adamant Marshadow FT from the NA distribution last year. OT MT Tensei and ID 100917. What would be your offer be.

Umm the IVs may not be ideal. I just SRed for nature but all legendaries and Mythicals are guaranteed 3 31 IVs.

I have given a fair offer of 8 codes lol

Could you do 4 Poipole, 2 of LL, 2 of KG and 1 TT.

Sure! I'll prepare the codes right now. Is it ok if I message you the codes when they're ready?

Whenever you’re ready. If you don’t mind, can we trade now. It’s 1:30 AM here and I need to head to bed now.

Are you on?
