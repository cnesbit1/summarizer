Here is the summary:

Depends on the house, if you go for a 200k house then no, but a reasonable small house at 75k on a 20 or 25 year term is definitely cheaper than renting.

One thing to keep in mind is that you're not going to find a cheap place in a city to buy. You will almost always have to look outside the city for one.

Because of jobs, commutes, utilities, etc. I live in the country, internet is dogshit and if you're someone who relies on it for work or entertainment, outside of the city is not viable.

Quite easy to find a house for sale at or around 100k if you're willing to look 30 to 60 minutes away from a city.

Keep in mind those averages you're quoting, the vast majority of houses used to calculate them are in the city to begin with. They are not good indicative of all housing markets across the country.
