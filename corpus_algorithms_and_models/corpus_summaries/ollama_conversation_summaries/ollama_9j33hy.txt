Here is the summary:

My cousin started his ride home from work a couple days ago and only made it about 400 feet before his bike broke down. Turns out someone had walked by and cut his fuel lines during the day while he was parked on the street.

though ramps are infinitely easier
Yea that's me, haha

Why would anyone do that? What a dick move.

For ultimate style points, put the thing on the roof of something. or some other place where there's no way it could get to otherwise. take pics. then put it back in the truck.

It'd be tough for me to hurt someone who deserved it, let alone someone who didn't.
