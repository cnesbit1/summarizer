Here is the extracted summary:

Gotta wrap the end around the wand, not leave it out or clasped. Curling takes a lot of practice, don't beat yourself up about it! I find it much easier to use a straight iron to do curls
Oh wait, so are you saying instead of clamping the end I should wrap it around the outside and then clamp down on the rest? I can't understand why I have so much difficulty with the conceptualization of the action lol...
Practice before showers :) even having done my hair with hot tools since 13 and I still mess up every now and then. ❤️ you'll get the hang of it, slowly but surely.
That's right, don't clamp the end inside, it'll get a kink! I highly recommend hitting up youtube, there are endless curling tutorials, and being able to see everything makes it so much easier
So if you don't clamp the end and you wrap it around, how do you get the clamp back open to collect the rest of the hair if the ends are wrapped around the outside of the iron  versus inside under the clamp?
Ah, ok. Everyone has shown me to start at the end of the strands... Are you saying start at the top of my head like near my part?
