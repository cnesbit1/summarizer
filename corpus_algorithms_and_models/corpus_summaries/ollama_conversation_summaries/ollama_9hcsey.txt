Here is the extracted summary:

I don't have Ultra Moon to farm for it myself, willing to trade any Sun/Ultra Sun exclusive, except Solgaleo.

The mon being trade will be caught and nature verified by myself, will catch and verify before trade happens. This can include any legendary given specifically by Ultra Sun.

I have a Japanese Modest Kyogre that i got off GTS, would you be interested in that?

Yea, I’ll get started farming that tomorrow morning if you don’t mind.

Cool, just hit me up when you're ready to trade.

Yeah no problem, take your time.

Don't worry, i'm in no rush!

I have it... finally
