They did not evaluate him properly.

Paul Holmgren
Lavi mismanaged the goal tending situation between Bob, Leighton and Boosh down the stretch and through the playoffs, refusing to put his trust in Bob. After they got bounced in the finals the owner essentially demands they get the best FA goalie out there so Leighton is dropped, Bryz is added for a ton of money eventually meaning Bob has no future with the team and thus gets traded away.

Their goaltending issues began well before Bryzgalov and continue now, what, 5 years removed from him?

Lots and lots of injury problems.

I get that you have an axe to grind with Bryz but it doesn't change the fact that the Flyers have done nothing but miss on goalies for 20 years.

Jeff Reese really failed him.

Honestly, I don't think Reese had any idea how to evaluate a goalie like Bobrovsky.
