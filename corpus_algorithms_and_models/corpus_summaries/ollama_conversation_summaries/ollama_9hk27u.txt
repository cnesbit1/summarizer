Here is a summary of the text, extracted verbatim:

* Custom Latias/Latios: I'm offering custom redeemed PAL Latias/Latios from the upcoming event and looking to get some of the events that I've missed. I can do them on SuMo or USUM, on fresh saves (i.e. the saves are not managed). I can RNG* them to have good IVs if you would like, otherwise I can do standard redeems.

* Legendary and Ultra Beast RNGs: I have just completed the main story on Ultra Sun and can RNG* some legendaries. They will all have OT: Nitro and ID: 638853.

* Custom ESV Shinies Service: I can also RNG* custom ESV eggs that will hatch shiny on your game. Just check the sheet [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13dLjGgyp2nQHE2kRW-te5eh_TZwvUgAzPrP8ix9oTts/edit?usp=sharing) for what breedables I currently have in Gen 7 and Gen 6.

* Demo Pokemon (Ash Greninjas, Mega Steelix, Mega Glalie): I can also offer self-obtained custom Ash Greninjas (ENG or JPN tagged). Natures on Steelix (JPN 3DS) and Glalie (PAL 3DS) will be random, ORAS demo saves wiped using JKSM.

* RNG Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi: I can also offer Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi (OT: WISHMKR, ID: 20043).

* Items: I also have extra Gold Bottle Caps and some battle items that I don't really use.
