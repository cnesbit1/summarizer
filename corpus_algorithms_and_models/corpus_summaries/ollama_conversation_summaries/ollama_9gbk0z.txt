Here is the summary:

Growing up in the church gets really confusing when you are deemed old enough to be taught about a biblical approach to sexuality. My generation had a plethora of resources at our disposal: "I kissed dating goodbye" "silver ring thing" "true love waits" "purity rings" "purity pledges" were all around us.

Love was like a quantity. The more partners you had sex with, the more your ability to love would be cut in half. Someone who had only one partner could love them fully, but someone who had two partners would have half the ability to love because they'd already given pieces of their heart away to somebody else and formed a permanent soul tie.

For one we cannot accept the "sex positive" terminology as it tends to mean that there are no prohibitions against adultery, fornication, porn etc. and that consent is all that matters.

The solution to weird sexual repression is not sexual libertinism but teaching the whole counsel of God.

Yeah. I saw a few people here try to use it to mean "a more positive attitude about sex / way of talking about it." And I was like that really isn't how it is used in most contexts.

The problem is that people are trained not to read or trust the bible really. Many modern churches believe theology that really isn't biblical. So by necessity in order to not have people challenge it they will basically discourage actually trying to interpret it.
