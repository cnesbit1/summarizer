I’m looking for already redeemed legendaries.

I am willing to shiny hunt multiple things, amount depends on the thing you are offering. Also I can’t get gen 7 shinies, sorry. But I can still trade on gen 7

Are you after specific nature Xerneas? If not I have a careful one self redeemed(id: 050418 and it's on gen 7). I'd be willing to part with it for a shiny honedge(preferred sassy nature but will accept whatever) if possible on Y as I'm redoing a play through on it.

Would a feebas be more feasible? Id prefer the honedge cause it's one of my favs but you tell me which is easier

I can get you a shiny feebas Ot Rocomet ID no 01974. I’ll tell you when I get it.
