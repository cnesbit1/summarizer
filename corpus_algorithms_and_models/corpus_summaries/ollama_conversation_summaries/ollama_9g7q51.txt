Here is the summary:

What potential does your fanbase think he has, and what's his ceiling in your opinion?

For example, I think Andrew Mangiapane is quite over hyped. Many fans think we can be a top 6 winger, meanwhile I think he'll be a good bottom 6 winger that's probably gonna get pp2 time.

I mean due to all the media the leaf prospects are always simultaneously over and under hyped but I’d have to maybe say Liljegren.

Woah, being on the top pair is about outplaying the others at the position.

Projecting he plays in the AHL 1 year, then Leafs the next, and earns his way to the top pair isn't that hard to believe.

I don’t know what you’re reading on our sub but I’m on it every day and I’m usually participating in the Liljegren chats and never once have I seen anyone overrate him to the point where he’s a #2 in a year or two.
