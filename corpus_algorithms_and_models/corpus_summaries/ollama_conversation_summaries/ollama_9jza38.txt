A crack in a weld is always a bad thing but this doesn’t look too too bad. You could probably find a professional welder who will fill that in and weld it and it will be just fine
No professional welder would repair that. An amateur might, but a professional would tell you to replace it.
Replacing would be the best thing to do but frames can be costly and if you can’t afford it could be a temporary solution for a short time

Are you a welder?

edit fuck me, no not know
I am.

It's not the "right" thing to do by the book, but you may be okay...
Not by a mile it's not.  I wouldn't let my kids get on 'might be okay' and I'm pretty sure those dealers would let their own kids ride one of their refurbished bikes either.
If it's straight I see no reason a welder couldn't fix it.
