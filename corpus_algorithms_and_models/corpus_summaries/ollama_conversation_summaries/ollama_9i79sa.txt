Here is the extracted summary:

If I'm right, then you're not attracted to men, but you still enjoy spending time with them and recognize that many of them are interesting people who are valuable in a miriad of ways that have nothing to do with how you feel about their sexual attractiveness.

Maybe you are bi (assuming you identified as straight) and are sexually attracted to both men and women. Then you might be confusing wanting sexual intimacy with someone (and hanging around them for that reason), with friendship and enjoying socializing without that sexual/romantic attraction.

It's okay to not be social. I just hope you don't get sour because you don't hang out with people and only want sexual relationships, which are harder to form than friendships. Especially when you don't put yourself in social situations where you can meet others.

Look. We both know your not sexual attracted to me. And I am bored of you. You are definitely someone i don't want to chat to.
