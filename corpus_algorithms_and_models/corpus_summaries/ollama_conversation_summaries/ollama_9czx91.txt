Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

My gf and I have been together for 3 1/2 years, but recently our sex life has changed. Things that used to be common (like blowjobs during ovulation) no longer occur. If I ask for these things, I get an eyeroll or "The more you ask, the less I want to do it" (I ask maybe once a week). We still have sex about once a week, but it's become routine.

To people on the other end, why did you no longer want to do the sex acts that used to be regular? Foreplay for women happens outside the bedroom. Take some stress off her shoulders by taking care of household cleaning type things and learn to date her again. Do all of this without expectation of getting what you want.

Oh... Yes!!!! Everything related!!! If her brain is filled with responsibilities, where in hell do you want sex to fit in?!
