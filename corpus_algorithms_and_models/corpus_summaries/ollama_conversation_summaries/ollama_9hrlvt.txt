Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

So which is it? Are the admins complicit in promoting pro-Trump messages, or are they anti-Trump? Is it bad to have Russian propaganda upvoted, but ok when it's American propaganda?

They don't care about details. They will link any tiny website that copy and pastes right wing articles from Russian domains to garner ad revenue to Putin directly. Its absurd, they only care about making Trump and Trump supporters look bad as demonstrated by this blatantly brigaded comment section.

Reddit admins only care about money, it's not injecting an idea or a political stance, they are still 100 percent wrong here...

Honestly though, saying that the admins can't be pro Trump because they allow anti Trump stuff is just as retarded as saying that the admins can't be anti Trump because they allow pro Trump stuff.
