Here are the selected sentences, exactly as written from the original text:

So, what do you really want him to say the next time you ask "Do these jeans make my ass look big?".

This is low hanging fruit...if you can make your partner feel *good* in a relatively harmless way, you should do it.

I've never asked him how my "ass" looked in jeans. Sorry, but you kinda sound like a jerk, I'm asking for advice not judgment.

The rest of my post is accurate.....
Tbh you’re the jerk for this post. Use common sense: should you tell your partner? Do you honestly think that could ever be a good idea? That’s how to ruin a relationship 101.

If a partner wants honesty then, yeah, I think this a totally legit question to ask.

That’s also if your partner wants zero self esteem.

There needs to be a line drawn between being honest and providing too much info.

I believe you’re being a bit defensive. I’m not trying to attack you, but I don’t believe the above commenter was attempting to be a jerk. If anything, the comments in this thread have agreed with him. Telling your partner “Yeah” is a simple and nearly effortless request for you.


Have you tried asking him if you guys could just have sex without talking? That way you’re not directly asking him to stop asking you that question, but it’ll still get him to stop asking it lol

I wouldn’t subscribe to this way of building relationships based on obvious lies hehe. He should be able to handle criticism. And it’s not even bad criticism either. Having an average sized dick is only to be expected. It’s the very meaning of average.

What we all need to do is work on improving the things that we can change... bragging about the huge size of your average penis is kind of lame.

If a relationship is ruined by simple truth of someone's penis being average size it shouldn't have existed in the first place.
