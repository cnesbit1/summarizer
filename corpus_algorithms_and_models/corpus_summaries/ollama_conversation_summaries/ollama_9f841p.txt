I had him instead of Draisaitl, but I decided the fact that Drai pays center gives him the bump.

Pastrnak and Draisaitl are both currently a fair bit better than Ekblad as of now so you might be right.

Petterson over Patrick for sure

Slow down, Pettersson has yet to play a game.

Patrick also started shakey but the final few months he was looking solid out there.
