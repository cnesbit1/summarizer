Here is the summary of up to 250 words, consisting of exact sentences from the original text:

Submission Statement: Trump and Sessions were both in the room and approving when Papadopoulos proposed this meeting, showing absolutely a willingness and readiness to conspire with Russia.

Now that the first thread has come up, I'm sure that this is going to follow the same arc as the Trump Tower meeting story: Team Trump denies, then there's proof they can't overcome and they change their story to something just a smidge closer to the truth, then another detail comes out, Team Trump denies... and repeat this for about a week until they have no more lies to fall back on.

Papadopoulos is being charged with lying to the FBI. He is not being charged with any kind of collusion. He sentencing has been delayed again. The closest the Papadopoulos ever came to anyone Russian is when Stefan Halper honeypotted him.

Oh FFS. All we have here is Papadopoulous, the admitted liar, who is in fact facing charges because of his lying, saying Trump nodded his head about a potential meeting with Putin, and telling Jeff Sessions to get right on that.

How is that a "willingness to conspire"?   jfc.

Point 1. I gain nothing from America overthrowing Assad in Syria

Point 2. I gain nothing from having a hostile relationship with Russia

Point 3. .it would appear that Russia cares about the average American more so than some of our allies, such as Israel.
