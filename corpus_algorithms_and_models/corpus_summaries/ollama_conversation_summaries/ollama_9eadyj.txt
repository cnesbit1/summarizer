If you see a Pokémon without a nature, it's just because I haven't bred for its optimal nature yet.

I'm mainly looking for apriball or special ball HA Pokémon with ~4 EM (preferably as competitive as possible), but feel free to make offers.

Some Pokémon I'm looking for specifically:
* ~~Ferroseed, 0 speed IV, with ~4 EM (Specifically spikes, stealth rock, and leech seed)~~
* ~~HA Squirtle with 4 EM~~
* ~~Any of the other HA starters I'm missing~~

That's OK. I am working on the last one for you. Let me know when you're free to trade.

Your Pokémon are all ready.
When do you think you will be available?
