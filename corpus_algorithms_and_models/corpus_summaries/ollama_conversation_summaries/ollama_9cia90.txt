~~If you're requesting for breeding/hunting service, please take note that I'm only doing those after dinner (approx. 5 hours later). Sorry for any inconvenience caused.~~  
I'm available to do breeding/hunting now :D

1. [**Spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/119Rd1HsajQlU17mX5YFoMxtSF9y4r0x7m3_xgKS2rA0/edit?usp=sharing). Anything that doesn’t have full **Egg Moves**, I will breed Egg Moves onto them. It’ll take me some time but I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

I want my own Vivillon collection in Gen6 and am interested in your Elegant pattern. You are looking for Shop HA Fossils, right?

About my request, I'm looking for 5IV perfect Timid Scatterbug eggs in regular pokéball, one with HA and another with Compound Eyes as well as some extras, all in Gen6.

I have a 6IV Ditto in X, so I only need a HA parent :)
