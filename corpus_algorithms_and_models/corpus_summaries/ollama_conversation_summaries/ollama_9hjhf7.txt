North face. Actually if u have time you can go to the factory outlet at the country and buy coz the winter wear u buy in sg is not as thick

i mean of coz you can buy in sg and wear temporary coz the -30 degrees kind of weather i tested on sg quality ones not as thick. ard $200 - 250 if i rem correct. coz i went lugano switzerland factory outlet called 'fox town' they had pretty good bargain stuff there

Been to longyearbyen and please don't forget to bring spikes for your shoes. The ice freezes over and it becomes incredibly hard to walk.

Also, don't short change on a pair of waterproof winter boots and a good pair of winter socks.

There's a saying, if it's -10C outside, dress for -20C.

Funny thing is, in longyearbyen when it was -25, I was wearing only one layer of long pants. For pants I feel like one can already (or maybe I'm insane)
