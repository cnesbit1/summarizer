Oh! I thought Inktober is like, a drawing/doodle a day xD.
i thought so too, until i decide to actually go to the official homepage and read the rules.
I haven't drawn in like 5 years since I got burnt out on O level art and I've been wanting to get back into it. Any suggestions on how to do inktober?
&gt;1) Make a drawing in ink (you can do a pencil under-drawing if you want).
&gt;2) Post it*
&gt;3) Hashtag it with #inktober and #inktober2018
&gt;4) Repeat

Note: you can do it daily, or go the half-marathon route and post every other day, or just do the 5K and **post once a week**. What ever you decide, just be consistent with it.
