His friend's reaction is great
Funny, but a good reminder for riders. If you have a passenger, be sure to check their gear, and give them clear instructions for how to ride (and how not to). I always tell em "remember you're riding the bike as much as I am" and then talk about turns, leaning, sudden weight shifts, etc.
Nothing worse then having them move around at the wrong time, or not being consistent with the leaning.

Exactly what made me start doing this!! My ex would always shift her hips and move her head to the other side mid-turn.

I stopped letting people ride with me simply because I hated the way it felt riding. People wouldnt ride bitch properly and make the whole experience clunky.
Ugh.
