Feels good having a guy that can clap bombs accurately again.
Giving me Frk flashbacks "what a frk'n shot!"
Yeah, fuck off buddy we absolutely need more Zadina clips. Fuckin every time this kid steps on the ice someone scores. kids fuckin dirt nasty man.
I'm fuckin tellin ya Filip "golden flow" Zadina is pottin 50 in '19 fuckin callin it right now. Clap bombs, fuck moms, wheel, snipe, and fuckin celly boys fuck
It's amazing how much a guy like that changes an entire PP.
Those PP goals will win you games, having Zadina should greatly increase our very lackluster PP of the last couple years.
