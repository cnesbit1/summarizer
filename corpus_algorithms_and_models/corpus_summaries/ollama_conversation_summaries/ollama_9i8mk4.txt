Here is the extracted summary:

I admit I experimented with a couple guys back in college (8 years ago) and she said that that fact freaks her out too much to do anything romantic.

People have preferences, heterosexuality is one of them for most.

That's the thing. I am heterosexual. It's just frustrating being discarded for trying something different almost a decade ago.

Wait, why is this bad? People have preferences, heterosexuality is one of them for most.

Or become a better liar.

Note to self: stop trying new shit. ðŸ˜‚

Someone who wants to get to know you for real isn't going to be turned off by your past.

I experimented in college just so I could tell, definitively, if I was straight or bi.

Lots of bisexual people are monogamous, so that's a big misconception to confront right off the bat.

Whether or not someone has had same sex experiences has no bearing on whether or not they'll be faithful to you.
