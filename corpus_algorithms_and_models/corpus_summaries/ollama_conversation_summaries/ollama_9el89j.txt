I (F 20s) absolutely love it when my SO (M/20s) licks, sucks, kisses my nipples. It turns me on and gets me wet every single time without miss. It’s so intimate and it’s so hot and it makes me feel wanted and admired.

Do you guys have kids? My nipples are definitely my most erogenous zone and i looove having them played with and sucked on.

For me They feel totally different. I was worried about that to at first.

It stopped being an erogenous zone for us one month before and about 9 months after birth.

I breastfed for two years and there was never a problem regarding what you’re talking about. But everyone is different.

My only problem was my boobies becoming saggy af and now I’m insecure about them.

I BF my kids for. ever. Over 2 years each x 3 kids
