I can breed you one
One question: did you ever redeem one of these codes before? I'd want that mon.
Im planning to redeem the Kyogre for myself in ultra but if want the groudon I can offer you that.
That sounds nice. But the thing is....I'd need it soft resetted for a specific nature. Nevermind, forget about it ^^
I can soft reset. But I have to soft reset my other Pokemon too so I really don't know how long the process will take.
Can I put sth on top? Like any items or caps or whatever?
Sounds awesome. Can we possibly trade tomorrow? I have to sleep now. I could breed it after work
Yes that works I can trade tommorow
