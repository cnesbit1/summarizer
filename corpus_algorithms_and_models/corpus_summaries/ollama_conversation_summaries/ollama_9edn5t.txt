Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Hey, guess what? You went into shock! Your body thought you were gravely wounded and bleeding out, so it plummeted your blood pressure (which gives some people intense nausea) in an effort to slow your death!

Honestly, I was so stressed out reading about how bad the nurses and doctors handled everything

See, the issue with these places (the one I go to and have seen reviews for) is that the people handling these needles are ***not*** medical professionals.

Needless to say, I don't think you want someone like my friend sticking needles in you and drawing blood.

Actually the vomiting is cause by an adrenaline dump secondary to shock. Your body thinks you are dying and shunts blood to vital organs.

You may have had a vasovagal response, where the body preemptively puts you into shock because of perceived injury (needle moving under skin, knowledge that blood will be leaving your body soon).

I used to work at BioLife (CSL and BioLife are kinda the big two) and I just applied online. It was a pretty good stepping stone to get into the medical field if that's something you're interested in.

Probably just don't donate. Some people just can't, and it's fine.

I worked as medical staff in a plasma center and have some exactly what you have done. Smaller people are especially susceptible to having a reaction, but it can happen to anyone.
