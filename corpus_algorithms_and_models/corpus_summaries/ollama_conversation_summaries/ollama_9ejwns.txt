Here is the summary:

That's like a HUUUUGE overpayment right?

I think it’s pretty even value although VGK obviously get the better guaranteed player and their James Neal replacement.

Disagree. Clear win for MTL.

So a 20 goal winger for a 30 goal winger is worth one of your best prospects + a 2nd now?

I never understood this train of thought. Even though I think this is good for both sides and not a “clear winner” VGK got the best player in the deal.

That's a really stupid way to evaluate trades:

The team with the better active player wins the trade.

Vegas wins the trade.

Any NHL gm that looks at trade value like that gets rightfully fired.

You guys just really hate Vegas don't you?

Cannot happen, Patches will be so much better than Erat was.
