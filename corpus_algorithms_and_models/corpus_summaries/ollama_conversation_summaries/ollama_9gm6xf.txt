Thank you!
Is Christianity on the rise or fall in the Netherlands? What about Islam?
Ehm. Christianity is in slow decline, mostly due to secularisation, yet it holds enough cultural power in the country.

Sadly, Islam is growing due to immigration and converts.

Converts to Islam donâ€™t always come from Christianity as far as I know.

Most fall is due to that people becoming Atheists. This is what i see all around us.
