Now on month 4 of going semi-vegetarian. Recently my mom bought roast duck and roast pork, and I did not enjoy chewing through the meat at all. Interesting that my brain is changing.
I started this diet for health reasons, not ethical reasons so wasn't that strict with it. But it's cool that my taste for meat is reducing even though I still eat it occasionally.
Hello! Recently my gf and i found this restaurant called greendot where they serve mock meats for dishes ranging from herbal soup to rendang! 
Sigh, working late again today. Any good song suggestions for bad days like these?
