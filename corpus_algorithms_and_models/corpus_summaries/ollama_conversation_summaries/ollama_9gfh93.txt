Here is the extracted summary:

If period sex makes you squeamish or isnâ€™t your thing, I highly suggest you donâ€™t read this post. Even if this post ends up being short.

Iâ€™m in a relationship with my partner (28M) but, when we spent the day together yesterday, we didnâ€™t have sex; sometimes our time spent together doesnâ€™t culminate in sex.

However,we have a sexually open relationship so, I do have one or two play partners Iâ€™ve kept around. But...none of them are into period sex.

Which is why I came to Reddit to vent my period-hormone-induced-need-for-sex frustration. ðŸ™ƒ

Iâ€™m horny now just talking to you about it. Dammit why do we have to be so far away?

I have been trying to relocate, maybe this is a good reason to move to the Midwest ;)
