Here is the extracted summary:

I am physically sick from this and keep switching between vomiting and crying. I have more evidence than anyone should ever have proving the sexual harassment I have been dealing with for the past 3 weeks.

Yes. I said 3 weeks. Not 3 months. Not 3 years.

The final straw was me responding to his sexual questions with "I would prefer to maintain a strictly professional relationship." and him replying with "I don't mind if you don't mind."

In the three weeks since class started my fucking professor has asked me out 3 times, sent me numerous inappropriate texts, and refused to listen as I repeatedly told him I wanting nothing more than a student teacher relationship.

I know this isn't my fault. But it still makes me sick.
