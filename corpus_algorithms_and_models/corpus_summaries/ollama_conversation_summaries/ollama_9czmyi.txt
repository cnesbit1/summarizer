Here is a summary of the text in about 10% (up to 250 words):

* Radical feminism: What's that? If one is going to reject it, perhaps define what is being rejected....
* ...Radical Feminism in most all its forms is incompatible with Christianity.
* Really? I think Christianity is wildly supportive of radical feminism - granting equal rights to women is pretty radical, valuing a woman's word equal to a man's, appointing a woman to be leader and elder... pretty radical.
* Radical - advocating or based on thorough or complete political or social change; representing or supporting an extreme or progressive section of a political party.
* Scripture was and is radically feminist.
* Marriage is often a tool used to oppress women - look at how it is used throughout the world - you can not rationally argue marriage isn't used to oppress. Christians should oppose the use of marriage to oppress women and scripture demands we do.
* The scripture is universal, it is not simply relegated to the midwest of the U.S., one has to define terms for a reason.
