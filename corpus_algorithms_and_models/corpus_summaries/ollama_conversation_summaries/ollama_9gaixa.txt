Go back to living your life on your own schedule. Don't let her problems be your problems. And: if and when she ever knocks on your door again, get your gear off quick as fuck and answer the door buck naked. That will be the end of that.

Nah, you're going for shock and awe.
Wait, what gear are you talking about? I was thinking dog collar ... ball gag ... whip in hand. Maybe we have different definitions of “gear.” 😂😂😂
That's gold! I was using "gear" in the Australian vernacular -- meaning "clothing". But I like your interpretation much better, seeing as how we're after shock and awe.
What a hilarious image!
