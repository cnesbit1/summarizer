Here is the extracted summary:

Years prior to the public accusations Blasey Ford discusses the assault in therapy. That's corroborated by her husband and therapist.

Learn why women don’t report. Especially thirty years ago. Hint: it’s shitty reactions like yours.

Rather than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt we should be looking for the highest standard of character for a life-long judicial apointee.

This is not a court. The standard is totally different.

It's not a court in the legal sense but it is in the broader sense that you are passing public judgement on someone and punishing them.
