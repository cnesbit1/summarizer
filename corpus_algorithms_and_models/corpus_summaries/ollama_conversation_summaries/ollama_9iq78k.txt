I Didnt know until I tried , on the highway , the max speed of it is 110 and diying already.

The problem is this bike starts to die around 4/5 gear on 90Â° any ideas?

Brake in period? Like speed for each gear?

To answer your question: 110 km/h seems pretty reasonable. My old 250 XT with double the horse power only did 115 km/t.

I do everyday Around 90km/h to pass the small highway.

no.its like every engine have a specific speed limit when its new.i have a honda 125 and it had to be no more then 60km/h for first 1500 km
