Everybody turns into John Podesta and James Alefantis’ lawyers whenever Pizzagate it brought up.
**They’re treating the subject as if we are in a court room or a hearing, demanding absolutely irrefutable evidence or black and white proof of any wrongdoing, for us to even be allowed to have this conversation.**

It’s becoming exactly like every other conspiracy. First people pretend it’s bullshit then when it become so undeniable they pretend it was common knowledge all along and no big deal.
