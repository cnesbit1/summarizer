Here is the summary extracted from the original text:

This animal *should* have been **STEAMED** till **white** and drizzled with a light soy sauce. Aka the iconic **WHITE CHICKEN RICE** then served with fragrant oily rice with a small helping chili.

Drowning the chicken in dark soy sauce is *typical low SES* behavior. ðŸ™„

Canâ€™t wait for you all to be arrested by PUB AND THE POLICE. Singapore Supreme Court will most definitely put you away for a long long time, longer than kid rapists and murderers.

SMALL HELPING CHILI MY ASS THE MORE THE MERRIER

That's not dark soy sauce
Itâ€™s dark colored and brown but that doesnâ€™t make it
