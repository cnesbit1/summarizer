Be sure to talk with as many priests as you can!
Have you had a chance to visit a seminary yet? Have one youd ideally like to go to?
I haven't yet. That's all a few years out for me. My brother in law just started at St. Vlad's and we have a seminarian from St. Tikons assigned to our parish. They are both good resources.
Right now my focus is on improving my spiritual life and taking on more ministries in our parish (under the guidence of my priest, of course).

Said a prayer for you, too. Praying for divine guidance for your path.

I’m aware and I don’t need an evangelical to lecture me on how to become a Catholic priest there are plenty of people in the Church who can do that for me.
