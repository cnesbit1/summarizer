Here are the selected sentences:

When someone says "I seen" you can be sure the next words out of their mouth will never be "the inside of a library."

It’s actually a pretty common phrase in the Northern parts of America, I use it all too frequently and am pretty confident in saying that the inside of a library has books, or whatever those things with words inside them are called.

That's not how that word is used.

I disagree about making assumptions about people based on how they speak. I understand intelligence has little connection to how well a person speaks because language is a learned ability.

My intention wasn’t to be condescending; it’s to agree with you that, as *you* stated, you don’t seem to know much about this.

I have a degree in English and I still use y'all and ain't because I don't think of myself as being limited to one particular form of language.

In many instances it feels and sounds better, especially ya'll.

Hey shithead. Can we talk?

What happened to that guy anyway? He pull a /u/_vargas_?

How do people that think "hey shithead" is a normal way to open a conversation (given the context especially), function in the real world?

You don't heat up crack in a spoon, you just smoke it...

Some of us like to make a ceremony out of it.

Yeah, you heat it off a spoon to smoke it. If you don't have a pipe handy, you heat it on the spoon and use a straw or dollar bill or something to suck up the smoke. Seen plenty of people smoke it this way.

I think people shooting up usually use cocaine hydrochloride, because otherwise you have to add an acid to the freebase anyways to convert it back to a salt.

Only reason I mentioned that is because unfortunately I’ve seen/caught a few acquaintances in my life who’d use a spoon to cook coke into crack for smoking.
