Pet insurance is vital for this exact reason; most of the time it's a small expense but sometimes vet bills can be insane.

Last year, my brother got cancer and had to go through chemo, my mom had a fungal infection on her heart and had to have open heart surgery, and one of her dogs had to have surgery (I can't remember what for). My dad was paying for everything insurance didn't cover, and apparently the dog's medical bills were by far the highest. I think it was over $10k.

As a dog owner I can say they are. Pet insurance is a MUST

My cat got her feet mangled in a trap last week. Emergency vet=$150, next day amputation and follow up care=$1000.

I have a pet wellness plan through Banfield pet hospital and recently had a $6000 surgery done on my cat for free (I pay $45ish a month and this was the first month, we had only paid $45ish at this point)

Yes, actually everything went well, everyone's fully recovered by now
