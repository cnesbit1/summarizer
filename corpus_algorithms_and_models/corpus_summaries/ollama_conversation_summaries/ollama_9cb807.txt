Here is the extracted summary:

You're not going that fast to low side from loss of traction, you didn't over rev the engine, I didn't see sand or oil on the road... I've got nothing.

Yep I still have zero clue , cause I didnt brake, gave enough gas to straight up the lean angle and my tire pressure was good as well.

How do you not have any clue? Haha it’s clear as day you were way too hot and leaned way to quick with I’m sure cold af tires 😂😂

Tires can cool off rather quickly. But ya. Just go with the idea of it being an anomaly lol 👍🏻

How could the tires be cold if he was riding for two thirds of an hour before this?

Nice attempt at trollin lul 🤔✌️
