Here is the extracted summary:

Well done to monopolising the taxi industry.
They must have realised that GrabHitch is cannibalising their grab sales.

Only have grab and grab taxi for night commute. Gone were the days of cheap grabshare and grabhitch.
Vice versa, hitch Drivers would also like to share petrol costs with passenger that are going to the same places.

There's probably very few hitch drivers and riders between 1am to 5am, and a large percentage of rides cause issues.
You can also castrate everyone for female passenger safety

What's the better alternative you're "sure" Grab could have taken?

The demand has always been there. I used to open the driver app and wonder why people think they can get a hitch to the airport at 4am.

If grabhitch drivers don't want to deal with that, can't they just don't log on at that time? (not exactly sure how grabhitch works for drivers)

I'm pretty sure this is more about $$$.
serious?

Of course, that's been the goal from the start. But you are also looking at it from the wrong angle. It's not about getting more people to use other services on the app.

It's that the cost of handling complaints during those hours is not worth having it active when it doesn't affect a significant portion of their userbase.
If you were grab, it would be in your favor to remove hitch. 10% of a max 15 dollar ride vs 20%(?) of 30/40 bucks including surge, it's clear which is more profitable.

And the most important thing to note here is consumers do not have a choice. It's either take comfort / grab. Comfort = midnight surcharge. Grab = surge
