Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

I was at the mall and needed to use the head so I stopped into the bathroom. While relieving myself I decided to check my email and give social a quick scroll. I finished my business, went for a quick zip and promptly caught myself in my zipper. As you can imagine, this was quite painful and I was left with limited options.

The picture attached is worth 1000 expletives.

I want to give a huge shout out to my amazing wife who came home from work to help me free myself which saved me an ER visit (probably $500). We were able to remove the zipper from the pants with a good kitchen shears. We then used astroglide to free the zipper.

Photo was taken after attempting to free myself. It was the easiest way of explaining the situation to my wife and asking for her help.

This happened to me as a kid. I had just gotten out of the bath and put on my brother's favorite denim shorts with no underwear for some fucking reason. I zipped up and caught all foreskin. My dad couldn't free frank and he rushed me to the emergency room where Dr. Bonar (not joking) was waiting for me. His solution was to cut out the zipper and force the slider back over the foreskin. Rough stuff my dude.

Edit: Wow! Thank you everyone that cared about my dick.
