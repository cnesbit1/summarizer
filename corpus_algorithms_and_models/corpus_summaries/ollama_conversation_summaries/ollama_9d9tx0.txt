Here is the extracted summary:

Ford did this when he started the River Rouge plant.  Step off the line for any reason and fired.  Foreman could not let anyone off the line and was there to basically scream and terrify the men.

The men would stuff sheets down their pants to avoid soiling their clothes.  If you had the shits, you worked in your diarrhea all day.

Ugh god, reminds me of the new texas chainsaw massacre. Where she's begging and crying to her boss for a bathroom break, and he says 'fuck off slacker', and her miscarriage slithers down her leg.

Jesus wtf

He had his own spy service, spying on his workers, keeping track of who was cheating on their wife, who drank booze.  He paid $5 per day (a lot at the time) and thought this made him their ‘daddy’.

If you didn’t go to church on Sunday, you could be fired.

Oh, and it’s highly believed but never proved, that Ford **funded Hitler** when the NSDAP was near bankruptcy.
