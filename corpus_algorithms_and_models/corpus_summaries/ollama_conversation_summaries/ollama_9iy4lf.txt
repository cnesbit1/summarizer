A tall man doesn't hang himself on a doorknob. He always said if he went out, it would be by heroin. Weinstein killed him.
He paid to quiet abuse allegations giving like 1/3 of his net worth, sticking up for the scumbag girl that all his true friends kept warning him about.

Israelis know how to honey trap, ask Vanunu. Either Weinstein or Clinton murdered him, it wasn't a broken heart.
Harvey hired Mossad:

And we're just supposed to believe he killed himself by hanging due to a broken heart. L O fucking L.

How was this trainwreck child abuser a threat to anyone? Even unstable Rose doesn't take her seriously anymore. A shame she got her claws into him.
What is your childish delusional version of what would be happening now if he was alive? I'm seriously fascinated to hear it.
He had more integrity than to kill himself over a dumb bitch.

Take your emotional drivel somewhere else.
