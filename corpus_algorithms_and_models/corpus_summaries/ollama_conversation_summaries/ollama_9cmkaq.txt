Here is the summary of up to 250 words, selected from the original text:

You do realize that the reason she was put in jail was a result of her actions after school officials confronted her about the shirt, right? This isn’t a direct connection from the T-shirt to jail. There are other factors involved.

My own personal opinion is that the dress code does not need to be that strict, but to say that the T-shirt caused the officials to put her in prison is misleading at best.

The school absolutely has the authority to confiscate her phone, by force if necessary.

School resource officers are police officers stationed on a school campus. They do have the authority to exercise their duties on campus just as they would out on the street.

That hinges on those directions being lawful, which I would contend was not the case here.

It is within the law for the school to enforce dress code, and give consequences for those not following it.

She wasn't breaking the dress code. She was being punished for non-disruptive political speech.

A shirt that says “turn you on” is most definitely not within the confines of any school dress code.

The only even plausible defense for the school is that the shirt's words were "obscene", and that looks like a losing case.

Again, I don’t agree with the actions of the school admin either, but they were still completely within the law with their actions.

That's where I disagree. It's been established that political speech like this is protected, even for students in school.
