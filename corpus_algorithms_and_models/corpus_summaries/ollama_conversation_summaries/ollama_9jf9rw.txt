I've got to change out my tires on my bike, is it a major pain in the ass? It seems to be worth the effort considering the quotes I've gotten for tire changes in the area.

Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated
I tried one time on low profile sportbike tires.  Huge pain and never again.

Yes.  Mount and balance 90 bucks for a set of loose rims.  Independent shop.  Main dealer wanted 160.

Thats a good price.  Worth it.
