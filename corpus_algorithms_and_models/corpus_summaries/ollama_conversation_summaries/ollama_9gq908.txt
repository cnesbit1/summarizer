I don't know man, I'm 40, I'm fat, I didn't have sex between the ages of 23 and 39, I kinda gave up, then I met someone nice on the internet.

Men wouldn't brag about having big dicks if women didn't make it known how much better they are. If women went around talking about how great small dicks are then men would brag about how small their dicks are. Its all womens fault.
