Here is a summary of approximately 10% of the original text, selected exactly as written:

If you were to put an NHL team back in Quebec, how many new fans are you creating? Essentially none. The province of Quebec is now saturated with hockey fans, comprised of several generations of fans who grew up with the Montreal Canadiens and more who have reluctantly switched allegiance after the Nordiques’ departure left them no choice.

Adding a team in Quebec City would not grow the fanbase, but simply reassign it.

So even though these Canadian sites would be strong revenue generators initially, it would be a myopic solution to the league’s larger plans.

I think you’re missing the point. Say you have Franchise A that is making $1b per year. Then you add a second Franchise B 50 miles away. Franchise B makes $400m per year, but Franchise A’s profits drop to $600m per year.

Total profits stayed the same at $1b. It’s just now being split between two franchises instead of one.

Or invoke pro/rel

Quebec City has the Ramparts of the QMKHL which draws 13,000 fans on average which ranks it among the Arizonas and Carolinas of the NHL. Junior hockey drawing those kind of numbers is pretty damn good and indicative that fans there love hockey.

Relative to the MLB, NFL or NBA the NHL’s broadcast rights don’t go for much. But it’s still a primary source of income for the league as a whole.

The Remparts getting 13k day in, day out is pretty telling about how Quebec feels about hockey.
