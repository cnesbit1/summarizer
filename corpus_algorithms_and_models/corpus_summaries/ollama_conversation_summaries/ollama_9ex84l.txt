Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Once the engine is warmed up and running at speed, there is a fluttering maybe even spluttering sound. If I stop or slow enough the sound doesn't happen, and it gets faster/louder as I pick up speed.

If I fully pull in the clutch whilst at speed, the noise stops, even if keeping revs up, so it seems the noise is only when applying power and I've no idea where it is coming from or if that is normal for a "big" bike or a twin??

It's 2 years old now so just outside of manufacturers warranty, but the place I got it from has a 3 month/1000 mile warranty.

And to think I chose this as a "bullet proof Honda" instead of the Ducati that looked nicer lol
