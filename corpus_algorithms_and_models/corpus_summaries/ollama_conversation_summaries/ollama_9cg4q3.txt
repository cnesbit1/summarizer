I am looking to add to my collection of Apricorn Ball Pokemon. I'm currently mostly interested in Moon and Love Balls, but I'll probably accept anything I don't already have :)

Hi. I have DBHA Remoraid and Smeargle that I can breed for Moon Ball Eevee and Fast Ball Hawlucha.

Sounds good to me! I'm currently breeding for other trades, but I'll start working on those too :)

Alright. I have yours done so just lmk.

Alright I've got pokes ready for you.  And I actually happen to have a ton of eevee's on hand, so would you prefer a Female with 5 imperfect ivs or a male with 5 perfect (they're timid)?

Oh nice, could I have a Female?

The pleasure was all mine! Have a fantastic Sunday :)
