I can redeem the codes or ask some people to redeem it for you :)

Can you redeem JPN codes? I might need some help redeeming (especially for single nature requests)

Yeah I can redeem on JPN Moon

I'm assuming you can also trade save files?

Yeah I can do saves. So you want 1 save as Lugia redeemed yeah?

Nope, it will only be one save as Lugia can be redeemed multiple times in one save
