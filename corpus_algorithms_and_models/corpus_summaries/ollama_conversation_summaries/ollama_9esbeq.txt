Here is the extracted summary (up to 250 words):

In 2004, a group started researching and discovered stem cells in mammals' ovaries. By 2012, they were able to take a human ovary and discover stem cells capable of producing NEW eggs in human females.

In 2017, they proved that not only eggs are lost but they are also partially repleted by stem cells, breaking the original thought that we are born with the same number of eggs and lose them until menopause. The issue seems to be in the fact that ovarian environment can not support egg growth, not just egg death.

This gives rise to possibilities that they can take a biopsy of an ovary, remove the stem cells, and grow brand new eggs at any age, even for women in menopause. Then, they can use IVF to fertilize that brand new egg to make an embryo, which could revolutionize how and what IVF and infertility are known as today.
