Yes, yes it is crazy.
just like how it was kinda crazy to think vegas would make the playoffs before last season started
Yes, yes that was crazy as well.

I mean it was still crazy to think, crazy doesn't mean *impossible*. Vegas *did* beat the odds significantly, I don't think that can be argued

vegas got a ton of talented players, ottawa has fuck all outside like 3 guys.
A lot of those players would never have been let go under the old rules. Plus questionable traded with Vegas by other GMs. They ended up with a good team. It wasn't a fluke.

I don't understand why people are so surprised they made the playoffs. The draft was designed to do that. Turns out 10 years of being shit doesn't make successful expansion teams.

wow
