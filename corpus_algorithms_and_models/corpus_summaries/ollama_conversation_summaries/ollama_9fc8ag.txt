So far so good, they never screwed any of my orders up despite the negative reviews I read online frequently. Estimated arrival time is always "9AM - 10PM" is it not? If no one is home at TOD, they will usually call you or drop you a message, then you can work things out from there. However, I have heard of cases where the delivery dude just leaves your parcel at your doorstep (lol)

That's good to hear! There's 2 timing on the page one says 13sep-15sep 9AM-10PM and below says 13sep. Just hope they don't leave it there lol

depends on the driver servicing your area I think, it's 50/50 from what my friends and I experienced.

By right in the whatsapp txt they will give you a code to give the delivery guy when he calls and no one's home to leave it somewhere.. but one time I didn't receive any call and came home to find my parcel sitting at my doorstep where anyone could take it.
