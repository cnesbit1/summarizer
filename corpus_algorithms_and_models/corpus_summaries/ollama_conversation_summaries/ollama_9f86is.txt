Here is the summary:

I would be too, except Sinemia is a much better deal and I just get actual cash back on my unaffiliated Mastercard that rolls right into my chequing or savings accounts at my bank.
No, sorry for being unclear. I meant that getting your Cineplex (or wherever) tickets from Sinemia is way cheaper than *anything* that gets you SCENE points. Then I just use a regular cash back credit card from my bank which gets me money no matter where I shop (not specifically tuned for one kind of store) which I roll back into my accounts.
Cards affiliated to one kind of purchase get you more "points" (or dollars) for those purchases but then have teeny tiny less than a percentage point returns on everything else. My card makes me a modest rate, but on *everything* I buy and I even charge some large monthly expenses like child care through it.
Ah gotcha, just looked it up, hadn't heard of them before. Thank you!
Sinemia is not Canada wide right now, otherwise would be a great deal.
