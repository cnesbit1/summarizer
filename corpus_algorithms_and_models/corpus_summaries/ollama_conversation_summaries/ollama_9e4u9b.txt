For Repeal is going to need some serious traction to close the gap.
The difference shock me
That's because religious leaders are actively sending it to their chat groups and encouraging people to sign.

&gt; Or are they a genuine minority?

I'm confused. Are you asking if LGBT folks in Singapore are a genuine minority? Because these petitions clearly show that they are.

Furthermore, the anti-repeal side is backed by powerful religious foreign organisations which the pro repeal side lack.
Because of the religious harmony act, some extremists are taking advantage of the situation to abuse it for all its worth.

Another reason is that the pro-lgbt are mainly young people, students and low level businesspeople. The older anti-repeal group (judging from user profiles) are either retired, have an iron bowl, or hold higher positions in country. They have much more influence than the other side.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't the government come out against religious hardliners as well?
