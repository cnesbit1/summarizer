Mandatory this happened a few weeks ago.

I was alone at my dad's in the evening and he'd just gotten these fancy new, very very sharp Japanese knives. He specifically told me not to touch them because they were sharp. I think I may be selectively deaf.

At around 11pm I decided to go upstairs and watch some YouTube videos in bed. But I suddenly heard a sound from upstairs. My brain went into full fight-mode, as in ANY SOUNDS AND MOVEMENT WILL BE TREATED AS DANGER. My imagination completely took over and I grabbed the largest fucking Japanese knife I could find.

I was the definition of stealth. I was danger. That burglar would never see me coming. I tip-toed up the stairs, holding the knive in an upwards position. My brain was convinced the burglar was in the bathroom (because where else would he be?) so I repositioned the knife for attack-mode.

Well, that was a mistake. You know, apparently those Japanese knives are not meant to be lightly thrown in the air and then caught like a spear. I dropped the knife after feeling it slide through my flesh like butter and searched for the lights, subsequently running into the doorframe.

I cleaned up the blood in my bubble of shame. I was definitely the worst ninja ever.

I now have a scar on my palm of which I will never tell the story to anyone I know.
