I’m a 42M and married for 9 years to a very beautiful woman. Before marrying my wife I was a serial monogamist but had a very healthy and adventurous sex life with my previous partners. I miss that so much you have no idea.

But my wife thinks sex is dirty and wishes that it didn’t exist. We do have sex, maybe once every three months. But she always has to initiate by asking “Do you want sex?”. If I ask or initiate the answer is always no.

I have tried talking to her about this in the past, but her response is that she enjoys it when we do it but that usually she doesn’t want to do it. She refuses to consider adding sex toys or wearing sexy lingerie.

It wouldn’t even be so bad if she wasn’t so hot! She says I should just masturbate when I need to, and that’s fine for temporary release of frustration but I still feel very empty without the intimacy, sensuality and eroticism in my life.

People here seem to think no sex = no marriage. It's fucking weird. There's SO much more to a relationship than sex. I know i'd sacrifice sex if I was with someone I truly loved.

I'm one of those people who would not only flatly refuse to give it up, but would dump them for trying to violate my bodily autonomy.

See, this is where we differ. I am NOT "unhappy" just because I haven’t had sex. If I was with the person I loved, I’d be happy, regardless of whether we have sex recently or not.

The only thing we disagree on is the importance of sex, really. For you it’s very important in a relationship. For me it’s really not at all. There are WAY more important factors.
