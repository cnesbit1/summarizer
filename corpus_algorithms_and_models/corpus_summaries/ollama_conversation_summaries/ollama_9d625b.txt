Here is the extracted summary:

I completely tore my ACL, MCL, partially tore my PCL and Meniscus. All at 36.

My knee is now better than the non-tore one, and I was back playing competing sports agains guys 15 years younger within a year.

The key: GET A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETIC DOCTOR AND PT STAFF WHO WORK TOGETHER.

Yes, listen to this person. Skier here, I know dozens of people with varied outcomes. The best followed this person's advice.

But what if you don't have insurance and no money?

Let's hope she doesn't live in a shit hole without health-care I mean USA.

Ain’t no poor people coming here from shit hole countries to get worked on...just because rich people from shit hole countries can afford the best of American healthcare doesn’t mean anyone else can.

Working with the right doctor makes a big difference in terms of recovery to any level of athletic capacity. Pair that with a knowledgeable physical therapist who knows your goals.
