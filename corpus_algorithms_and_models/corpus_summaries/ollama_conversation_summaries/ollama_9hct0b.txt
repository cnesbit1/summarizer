Here are the selected sentences:

Seems this really hit a nerve. Sign of good satire!

I downvote not because I’m offended by it, but because it’s the same tired, low-hanging fruit that evangelicals jab at without any critical thought and actual interaction, as usual from the Bee.

Hitting a nerve isn't indicative of good satire.

Of course it is indicative of good satire, but not in isolation. The example you cite is irrelevant since that's not what's happening in the original piece at all.

Insulting someone and then using their offense to measure how good your satire is, means it's really crappy satire.
