Here is the summary:

The survey of 1,002 girls aged 14-21, published on September 5, showed that more than one-third (38 percent) of girls are catcalled, experience wolf whistling or are at the receiving end of sexual comments in public at least once every month

That's not flirting. That is harrasment and done mostly by adult men not other children. Sexual harrasment is sexual harrasment. Listen before talking out of your arse

No one is being accused of sexual harassment for just saying hello, that is just something guys like to hypothesize will happen now that more women are pushing back against actual sexual harrassment and assault. Its an attempt by men to get women to go back to being afraid to speak out

Maybe read the article first before commenting then you might not sound so foolish
