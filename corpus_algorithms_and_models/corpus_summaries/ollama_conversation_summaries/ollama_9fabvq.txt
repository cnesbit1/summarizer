This last weekend I went to an arcade bar with some of my friends from school. We were having a grand ol' night and when everything came to an end, I was dropped off at home.

The next morning, in a haze, I woke up with a headache and dreamlike memories from the night before. Reminiscing on the previous night I realized something wasn't right. I hadn't consumed enough alcohol for my memories to be as cloudy as they were. Everyone seemed far away and time had escaped from me.

I called up one of my classmates that was out with us and asked him if we did anything recreationally, he said no.

One of my friends calls me to ask if someone tried to get us to go with them as we were leaving the arcade bar. I vaguely remember someone trying to get us to leave with them, we were the last two females left in the group.

Being the paranoid person I am, I took an at home drug test that tests for everything (PCP, cocaine, amphetimines, barbiturates, benzos, THC, etc). I tested positive for both barbiturates and benzos.
