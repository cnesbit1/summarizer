Some people might think this is a joke or troll or something, but I’m serious. This is legit. I know I’ll always have the Lord, but I do fear growing old alone. I really want a Christian girl to share my life with, but I have a big problem. I hate sex. It seems embarrassing and gross and dirty.

My big dilemma is that, like I said, I do want a girl to share my life with. I want to be a normal Christian husband/wife in every way minus sex. I mean why couldn’t we just hug instead? But I’m so afraid that I’m going to spend my entire life alone because I’ll never find a girl that is ok with never having sex.

I don’t know. Sometimes I just get so worked up about this. I’m a single child and have very few friends, none close. My parents are the only people that I see regularly. Even as a Christian, the thought of life alone is scary.
