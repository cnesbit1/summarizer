Here is the extracted summary:

I hope he scores a hat trick. Would be hilarious.
If Ward is in net it will only take three shots
If Forsberg is in net it will only take three shots.
Leafs should have at least one of Sparks, McElhinny or Pickard hitting waivers, might be something to consider
3 goals only ever takes 3 shots.
At this point... fuck it, give it a shot lmao!
Yeah he was our capstone free agent signing this summer...
Everytime the Leafs have been in a situation lately where they "have to make a decision" they've found a way to steer clear somehow.
