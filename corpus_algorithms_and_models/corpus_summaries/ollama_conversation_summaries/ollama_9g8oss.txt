Here are some sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* "What is wrong with you my dude?"
* "You showed him haha". Ok cool, but a lot of guys have small penises and it's really in bad taste to glorify that kind of thing."
* "I don't think I said anything that would make you think that."
* "Yeah. Every post about unsolicited dick pick > Haha your dick is small. Every post asking about penis sizes > Size doesn't matter. smh"
* "You wouldn't go up to a girl in public and pull out your dick to show it off to her, would you? Guys who send dick pics are like 21st century flashers..."
* "So when we get them we know to hit them where it hurts. Dick size."
* "I think he's saying it's mean to those with smaller penises, who don't do shit like this. Kind of like making fun of a shitty manipulative woman by making fun of her acne scars or stretch marks..."
* "It’s because it doesn’t matter to anyone except guys."
* "BUT, sending an unsolicited dick pic is rude and disrespectful, and that person deserves nothing but ridicule."
* "Exactly. I will admit, I am extremely self conscious of my penis so it would hurt if a girl were to make fun of me..."
* "It's sad to think that you and so many others think your value is solely in your dick. And this lack of concern for people who get harassed by your fellow losers."
* "Here's the thing, if someone is going to send you *unsolicited dick pics*, that is a **complete lack of respect** for the person who gets them- no different than flashing a person on the street."
* "So as a woman who has touched many a dick of differing size, shapes ajd colours and knows how insecure men are about them, if they're going to *force something on me that I never asked for* then **fuck their feelings and insecurities why should I have to be respectful if they aren't**."
* "Lol because obviously the solution to a problem is to do exactly what they did back to you."
* "She can respond to sexual harassment anyway she wants, and making fun of his babydick is going to sting the most. That's the whole point, responding to sexual harassment in a way which will hurt him the most."
