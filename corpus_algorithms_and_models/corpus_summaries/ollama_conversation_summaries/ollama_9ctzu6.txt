Here is the extracted summary:

She got him on audio admitting that he raped her. Any defamation suit would be of very little use.

If there’s any group delusional enough to think the audio tape doesn’t matter, this would be it.
That won’t happen.  Discovery on this is the last thing the church wants.

Utah is a single party consent state for audio recording.

It's admissible.

Plenty men will admit to rape as long as you don’t call it that. They get offended when you call it that.

She did have a case. The judge...a Mormon, dismissed it because it of statutes of limitations.

But for decades she tried to get help, even from police (who were also all Mormon). She tried to get help long before finally hiring a lawyer.
