My brother has mentioned before that since I'm a girl I don't care as much about it as they do. Sounds to me like a double standard. Girls get punished for being 'uncouth' and unladylike because people don't like it when you upset their ideas of what a 'good lady' should be. Men on the other hand, can swear because that doesn't upset anyones stereotypes.

I guess the women footballers aren't as serious about their jobs as the male footballers too...ugh. Exactly. It’s so infuriating- especially since I love the sport and it’s a semi-final, and I want to watch my fucking team play, but they’ll shout at me if I go out there- they also seem to find some messed up strength in each other being men if that makes sense-

Uh, yeah see my brother is already at that stage, he’s taller and bigger than I am, and although he’s two years younger, he takes this as a sign that he can say what he wants to me.
