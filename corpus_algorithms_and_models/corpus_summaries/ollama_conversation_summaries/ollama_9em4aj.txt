There is an excellent and long thread over at Above Top Secret that claims to have some inside info from folks who've called local newspapers in the area. It's a pretty wild scenario that leads me to believe that the government is using the observatory in the name of national defense, possibly to keep an eye out for a new Russian space threat.

Awesome Iâ€™ll check it out!

ATS actually had one of the most eye-opening threads ever, in my opinion, in the last few years. It was by a gentleman claiming that the Phoenix Lights craft, and others like it, are essentially "Mind Hoovers", and they utilize the consciousness of millions of beings to store and then recapture star map data.

Do you have a link to that thread?

I found ats after 9-11 there is some wild shit on there

He's talking about the Astro thread. Seriously my favorite thread ever. It's A LOT of reading, but I highly suggest going down this rabbit hole and reading both of these threads.
