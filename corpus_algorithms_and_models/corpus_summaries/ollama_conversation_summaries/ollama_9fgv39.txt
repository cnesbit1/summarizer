Porn is a poor reflection of actual sex, some people do like throat fucking as part of a kink type thing but it's definitely not everyone's thing
I think you'll see a trend of mainstream porn getting more and more extreme in these kinds of cases as what was once considered risque becomes tame
You might be right this one time. But history is not on your side... Consider that 30 years ago BJ’s and anal play were rare outside of porn. Now, they’re part of most couples sex life.
I don't think you'll find many people consenting to throat fucking unless it's actually something they really get off on
Not true. I consent to it all the time. My partner loves it and I want to please my partner.
