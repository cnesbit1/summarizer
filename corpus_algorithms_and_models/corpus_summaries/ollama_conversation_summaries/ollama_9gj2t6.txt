Here is the summary:

I lived through the mega bush days of pre-shaving. Do not want. Shaved all day long. Probly less chance of crabs too
Being clean shaven makes it unlikely to get crabs since they live on the hair. However, it also means stds are more likey.
It’s basically creates a bunch of open wounds on the skin. Razor burn or nicks are an opening for bacteria and viruses.
Go get tested in a while for everything. One encounter is unlikely to give you an std, but keep that risky shit going and you’re bound to catch something.
Not sure what's normal about her, but if you are sexually active and don't have a monogamous partner you should get tested once a year or so.
