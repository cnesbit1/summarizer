Here is the extracted summary:

If anyone is willing to trade, I’ll be ready to trade this pokemons until the end of the night.
Hi. I don't have the Conkeldurr you're looking for but I can breed you an HA Timburr in a Dream Ball if you'd like that.
I’d love this! What will you want in return?
The HA Eevee will do. Just need a little bit of time to breed the Timburr.
Take your time! I’ll make an egg right away! Tell me when you ready, okay?
Hi! I have one ready! Btw do you want a male or a female? Because I hatched both genders.
Cool, I need a few more min. I’ll go with the female :)
Sounds good. Just let me know when. (:
sure!
i’m ready
