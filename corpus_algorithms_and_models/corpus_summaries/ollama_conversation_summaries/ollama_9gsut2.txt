Hey all, so today im heading out to the Smyth stores we have in London, in hopes to come back with some codes to trade here. Wanted to gage what I could get for them, so feel free to offer away! I prefer your events to have proof :)

Do you have wc proof?

How many codes would you want for it?

I'll be here about 12 hours from now, will go to the cinema and have drinks so maybe later but around then :) ill see how todays search goes, i may have to ask random kids to go in and ask too lol

So I went today and to be honest, this event looks like it will be a tough one. It was 1 Code per customer and since its a new store they are giving the code away at in the UK, a manager had to do it or was at least aware of the transaction, so i couldnt grab extra codes :/ Would you be happy offering something else for the 1 code, along with the XYZ?

Ah ok
I'm happy to trade for the XYZ :) let me know a good time for us to trade! I will be sleeping in the next 20 minutes but will be awake in about 8 hours

Hey hey, im online now and will be for about 90 mins?

Connecting now!
Can you send me a picture of the WC proof with our usernames on it please :)

Thanks, code sent :)
Thanks!
