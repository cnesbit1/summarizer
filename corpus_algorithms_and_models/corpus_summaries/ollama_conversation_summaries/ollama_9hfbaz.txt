Here is the summary:

Woke up this morning to find that my bike was gone... again.

This was semi my fault - left it on the road side without a lock at night, woke up to find it missing. Sure. Okay. Stupid mistake.

Everything was going great, it had a disc lock alarm, a chain, I'd just ordered a cover and I parked it in my back garden, hidden from the outside world behind two big locked gates. Woke up this morning and it was gone.

How the fuck? Pretty sure my house is being watched - is there any way to stop this happening again other than just you know, getting a car?

When I was looking for my first bike I found a used one at a dealership with saddlebags mounted on it.  Not being sure if they could be removed without actually taking the mounting hardware off I thought to myself "eh, maybe I'll just keep a screwdriver in the saddlebag" and then thought back to the time police in the UK did a "weapons sweep" and confiscated pliers and screwdrivers lol.

carrying knives around is illegal

using a knife as a weapon is illegal
