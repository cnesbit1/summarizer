Amen to that. I recently had issue recently where my faith almost cost me my entire business.

When I went to the legal advice subreddit people laughed in my face and told me they hope I end up on the streets. People are not nice to Christians.

I don’t see where God said you had to discriminate us in your business. The persecution complex is so strong with you it’s disgusting.

God claims to be everywhere.
If salvation could be found under your couch we wouldn't need god to exist.
Good thing he probably doesn't then.

Well I'd rather probably waste my life, and definitely not go to hell, than definitely not waste my life, and maybe go to hell.
I hope you also subscribe to every other religion that has a version of hell too.
