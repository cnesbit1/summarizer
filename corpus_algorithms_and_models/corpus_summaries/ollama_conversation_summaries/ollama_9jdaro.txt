Here is a summary of about 10% of the text:

Dude was wrong for the "adam &amp; eve" comment, but he's not wrong about the dress code blame. Girls who don't know how to dress right at school ruin it for those that do. They're ***absolutely*** to blame for strict dress codes that don't allow for shorts or skirts.
Guess what? Telling everyone to blame a whole gender for not being allowed to wear shorts to school (in addition to everything else wrong in their lives) is horribly immature and completely inappropriate coming from anybody with any affiliation to a place of learning.
