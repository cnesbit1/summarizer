Say what you want about the Arizona Coyotes, but I believe in their current state, they're a team on the rise.

However, I think it would be better for the league and the sport as a whole if they won the 2015 lottery and selected McDavid. Why?

* Edmonton had too many fucking chances and they bumbled most of them. Why should they keep getting rewarded for failure? They're a fucking shit show, and it's a disgrace that they keep getting top picks and not using them to turn their franchise around.

A generational talent like Connor McDavid would have been a godsend for a struggling franchise like Arizona. Just imagine how much more popular the team would have gotten overnight.

I'm not a Coyotes fan, or a McDavid fan, rather I'm a fan of seeing the sport grow.
