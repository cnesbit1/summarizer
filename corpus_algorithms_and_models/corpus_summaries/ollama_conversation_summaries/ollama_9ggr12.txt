I just have a question about pads and stuff and I'm wondering if it's okay to ask here?

"In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is just more TV. You're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame.
On a cycle the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore, and the sense of presence is overwhelming."
-Robert Pirsig, *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*

"It DOES seem like on a bicycle, I feel like more happy and it just feels so much better overall. And it's also true that filming stuff sometimes does ruin the experience."
