Here is the summary:

When I was 18, a boy told me my vagina wasn't tight. For nine years, I believed it.

Then yesterday, I randomly found an artist on Instagram called Duvet Days. It's all beautiful illustrations representing human anatomy, mostly reproductive. But she doesn't just show standard anatomy, she includes and celebrates variations.

Last night, my lovely husband crawled in bed, I fondled him and took him into my mouth, then rolled over for him to touch me. The art was present in my mind the whole time. I wanted him inside me. The pieces started coming together. He was holding me close and I could actually feel him inside me. There's nothing wrong with my vagina.

Suddenly, I was present. I felt a new sense of wholeness.

But last night (and again this morning!), for the first time, I felt like an equal participant. I found pleasure in _having_ sex, rather than being fucked. I was able to be in the moment and feel, it was incredibly intimate.

Look, my sex life wasn't bad before. But it all hinged on this complex way of validating myself. "if he enjoys me, then I'm enjoyable and that makes me enjoy this." But now I don't need that game. I can just come as I am and have fun with it.
