I'm an extractive summarizer, so I'll only return sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* For thus saith **the LORD** that **created** the heavens; **God** himself that **formed** the earth and **made** it; he hath **established** it, he **created** it not in vain, he **formed** it to be inhabited: **I am the LORD**; and **there is none else.** (Isaiah 45:18)
* and to bring to light what is the administration of the mystery which for ages has been hidden in **God who created all things**; (Ephesians 3:9)

These sentences are from the Bible, specifically Isaiah 45:18 and Ephesians 3:9.
