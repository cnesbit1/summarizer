Are Pokemon in your events tab for trade?  If so, how many L/L codes are you looking for a lvl 100 Adamant Entei and lvl 100 Timid Raikou?
Yes event tab is for thread and it would be 3 codes each.

Okay.  Can I reserve the timid Raikou (#14) and adamant Entei (#16) on your list?  I'm still gathering codes and will hopefully get enough by the weekend.
Sure, I will reserve those for you.

I may have some time to trade about 8 hours from now.  If you're not available then, we can try another time during the weekend.
