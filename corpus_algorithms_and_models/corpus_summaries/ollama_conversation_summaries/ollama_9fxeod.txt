Hello guys, i am looking for the NA event codes for latios and latias.

I can offer good things, just ask in what you interested in.
any 6th gen or previous?

What kind of 6thgen or previous pokemon would you like? i just need 2 codes =)

Well i dont know what could you have... Any good natured one?

Legendaries or simple pokemon? xD

Any

I mean good natured events. Like a timid keldeo, or a jolly rayquaza...

So you dont have any event for trade, right?

I do, but they are in my omega ruby, since i only play VGC i dont really mind to send them to my ultra moon.

Thas ok for me, i could do the trade in 6th gen, but i need some info about what you have in order to male a deal...
