Don’t expect r/conspiracy to suddenly suckle the nipple of MSM.

Ha! All the media does is circle jerk about Trump.

I looked for BuzzFeeds investigative reporting on all the suspicious financial transactions around 9/11, they must have had the day off for that one... but muh Russia!

Maybe the co-founder did the digging during his time at HuffPo? Nope, not there either.

The whole Russia nonsense is about the same thing the illegal invasion of Iraq was about. Never mind all the foreign money and influence that’s been corrupting the US government for decades, muh Russia...

This is a legitimate piece of investigative reporting and Buzzfeed News is a legitimate news org. I’ve just pointed out the credentials of the authors.

You’d be surprised what you can learn when you go to the source rather than the interpretation you’re given. Give it a shot.

It seems clear why you come to this sub, no interest in conspiracy just looking to berate people.
