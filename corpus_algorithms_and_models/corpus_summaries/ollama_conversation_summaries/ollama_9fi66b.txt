I can also breed for stuff like 0 attack IV, 0 speed, hidden powers.

Trade ratios are dependant on what you want. More complex stuff like perfect IV breeds will cost more/get you less.

Could you do 
* Ulra Shieldon 
* Great Anorith 
* Net Tirtouga 
* Nest Lileep

for 2 of each ball?

IVs I'm not too fussed, and if it's no stress maybe Adamant on the turt and Anorith and whatevs on the other 2. If they already have EMs just go with the ones they have :)

Oh yeah, I'm guessing these are HA fossils too?

Yeah they are HA, I can do non-HA if you want though.

Nah HA is good for me. Thanks!

I have to go out now but should have them done by tomorrow if that's OK?
