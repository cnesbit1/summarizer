Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is.

For my 2-year riding anniversary, I want to get some really nice adventure riding boots. Recommendations?

I now wear Alpinestars Roam 2 WP boots. These have been great, but I'd like something with more protection. Specifically, taller. I have basically zero shin protection.

Revzilla classifies the Roam 2's as "tall," but they are nowhere near as tall as Alpinestars Tech 7, for instance.

I'd like to protect my feet & shins better than the Roam 2 WP can, with both waterproofness and breathability if possible.

Emphasis on the breathability, as I do a lot more riding in hot, dry weather than in the rain.
