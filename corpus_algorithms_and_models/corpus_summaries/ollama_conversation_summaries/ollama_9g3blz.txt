Here is the extracted summary:

I live in Sweden and can say this about the country with the second highest suicide rate in single households in the WORLD . Its a country with 4-6 months in darkness , rain and snow, and now also populated with over 300 000 young men from afghanistan and Syria, Iran.

Well I consider myself an lawful swedish citizen, I pay taxes and my family has an succesfull resturant so we have long since paid our debts to this country, but I see your point. The thing is our turkish community rarely mixbreed so that is my answer haha. :)

There is a huge difference in the attitude and intent of different immigrant groups. The immigrants of the 60:s - 90:s mostly sought to assimilate and became well-functioning parts of society, adapted to swedish culture and joined the workforce.

So you are saying you aren't shitting in the streets?

That kind of economic analysis has been debunked over and over because it doesn't differentiate between labor immigration and welfare immigration, and also fails to account for a lot of the costs associated with immigration in other areas of society.
