Here is the summary of about 10% of the text:

* Codes | +1 Code | +1 Code | +1 Code |
---|---|----|----|
2 Codes | +1 Code | +1 Code | +1 Code |

&amp;nbsp;
##### UBs I can go up to 5 IVs. 
* Shiny + Nature = 7 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 4IV = 9 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 5IV = 12 codes

**Have to check this.*

Vivilon patterns available: **Sun, Savannah, Marine &amp; Polar**

Custom shinies/UBs will be RNG'd on a console with pCalc &amp; CFW.

I can also offer RNG in **Retail HeartGold**, but the only (good and shiny) things I have left are:

* Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Entei
* ~~Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Kyogre~~
* Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Ho-Oh.
