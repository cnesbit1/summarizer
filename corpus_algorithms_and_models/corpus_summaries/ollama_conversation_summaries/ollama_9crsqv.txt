My husband and I have been married for a year and a half, we have a 3 year old child together.

Whenever my husband and I have sex, he says that he can't feel anything during because my vagina is too loose.

He has mentioned this to me around last year, and didn't really want to keep initiating it so he would go and masturbate instead.

Of course it hurt my self esteem, I actually enjoy the sex we have but he doesn't and I wanted to make this better for him so I looked up ways on how to naturally tighten vagina.

I've tried everything: kegel exercises, regular exercise, diet change, ben wa balls, other tools. and different sex positions. But for some reason, it barely works and it just widens up again during sex... so sex life hasn't really improved.

It is called death grip, but it is fair to say it could just be PMO addiction (porn-masturbation-orgasm).
