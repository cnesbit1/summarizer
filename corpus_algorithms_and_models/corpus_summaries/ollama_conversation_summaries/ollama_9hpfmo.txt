Here is the summary of about 10% of the original text:

I was born and raised Christian, my parents have very conservative, traditional values and it’s all I knew growing up.

I’ve been saved, baptized, recommitted my life, and prayed countless times for god to save me, but it never felt real. I wanted so badly to feel saved and like God was with me, but it never happened. When I was a kid I would be up at night crying because I thought I did something wrong.

I don’t think I can ever truly be a Christian now that I’m older. Having spent most of my life in different churches, and with a family who’s life revolves around god, I can firmly say that it’s not for me.

What frustrates me the most is that I can’t express these feelings to my family. I can’t have a civil debate or talk about the way I feel without my mom or dad getting mad at me and starting a fight.
