Here is the summary:

When you take this fact and cross-check with what GCT said about Edwin Tong, one wonders how much pay cut Edwin actually took to become minister.

It's obviously not 2 MIO become 500K like what GCT said. I doubt the pay cut is really that much maybe 10-20% max.

According to an old interview with Shanmugum who was also a lawyer, he was paying more income tax than the minister salary he is currently getting.

Shanmugam as a full minister is getting a lot higher pay vs what Edwin is getting now so by extension if Shanmugam took a massive pay cut as a full minister, the pay cut taken by Edwin should be similar if not higher since he is getting lower a lower pay now

FFS. GCT said Edwin Tong was making 2 million you dimwit.

Edwin Tong is a minister of state so his salary is around $1.02M with AWS and 3 month bonus and 3 months performance bonus. He took a $900K pay cut assuming it is true that he earned $2M a year previously. So 40-50%, GCT wasn't making it up

I'm defending facts. I seem to be defending the govt a lot because those opposing the govt usually do so by distorting facts.

Just because U failed to communicate properly and failed to google doesn't mean U have to be rude to others
