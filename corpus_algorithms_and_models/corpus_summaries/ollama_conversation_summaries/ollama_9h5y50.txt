I have ultra moon so I was able to receive the 2018 Latios, but if you have the ultra sun latias then maybe depending on what you want.
Well, I do have both UM and US by my main save is on the US cartridge so I'm not reseting it and I can only redeem one latias for myself so I'm kinda in the situation you here in.

Given the time it would take me, 8 codes.
I see. That is way too much for only 1 Pok√©mon for me. If it was something else then maybe. Good luck with your trades!

Not used to bargaining aren't you ?
For 8 codes I wouldn't have had any second thoughts. Just make an offer, if we cannot reach un agreement so be it but at least let's try.

Are you joking ?
