Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Saw an older thread on this topic from like 2 years ago and found the question interesting, so here it is again. If every player CURRENTLY ACTIVE reverts back to the age of 18, who’s your top 5?

For me it’s 
1. Sidney Crosby.
This picks imo makes sense, highest PPG of an active player, natural born leader and can score goals too.

2. Connor McDavid.
This kids special, coming first in the league in scoring on a team that can’t make the playoffs, his explosiveness and speed are unmatched and his hands are silky.

3. Evgeni Malkin.
The most important skater position in hockey is the centre, and Malkins a big one, literally.

4. Alexander Ovechkin.
Hey look, not a center. Ovi’s a explosive goal scorer, and has a huge trophy case.

5. Erik Karlsson.
Call it recency bias if you will, but Erik Karlssons a magnificent player.

So that’s my list but I definitely have some bias and also number 5 was harder for me, I feel like the first 4 are the elite of the elite currently and then you have to go from there.

1. Crosby
2. McDavid
3. Thornton
4. Kane
5. Lundqvist
