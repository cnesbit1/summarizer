Here is the summary:

I'm currently dating someone who's scared that one day I'll suddenly feel she's not worth my effort cause she's stupid or slow and I'll go find another girl that's smarter than her.

I don't have a dating history of cheating, I don't have a history of dating smart girls nor do I have a history of dumping people when I think they're dumb as bricks face it, we all do dumb shit all the time.

&gt; Sure at times if she says something absolutely bizarre I'd ask "what in the fuck was that lmao" but like, even I ask myself that when I do something dumb.

I really do appreciate and love this girl but I don't know what else I can really do to show that I love everything about her even if she says something absolutely dumb at times?

&gt; why the fuck can't I just have granola bars for lunch

Okay second question for those who don't wanna care about the above question:
