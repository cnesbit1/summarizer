Here is the summary:

I don't wear gear (beside helmet) when I commute to work. It's a half hour trip through heavy traffic. I don't exceed the speed limit and the most I do is filter traffic. Which is why I ride primarily.

My justification: law of averages and chances. The more reckless or hard you ride the more you increase your chances of something insignificant ruining your day.

I feel better now. Thanks for listening. That's my daily confession.
Well this just made me realize there's a good group of survivors here.... thanks for all the feedback none theless.

You might be perfectly fine doing this, you might not.
