If youâ€™re able to buy cannabis in person, a debit card is a far better option than a credit card from a privacy point of view, since debit card data is processed and stored in Canada. (Cash, obviously, is still better than that.)

Cash is the best solution.

This is good for bitcoin.

It isn't good if you want to call yourself a currency. Hyperdeflation makes a currency effectively useless.

Bitcoin is even less private than a credit card, unless you bought it with cash for that one transaction. Everyone can see your wallet activity, everyone.

So what? Buy enough things with that wallet, and perhaps use it at some future pharmacy, or other store that needs ID or a home address... Hell, with enough transactions it becomes as identifiable as a finger print.

It's stupid to not use a credit card for all your purchases. Even the cheap 1% cash back ones are still 1% cash back. That's like $200+/year just for buying stuff you're already buying.

Bitcoin is even less private than a credit card.

That would make sense since the older you are the more likely you would be to apply for one and secondly I would suspect the older you are the more likely you would have the wealth or credit history to be eligible for one.
