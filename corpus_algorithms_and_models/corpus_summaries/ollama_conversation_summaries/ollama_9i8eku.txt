About 4 mins into my planned 25min shower, I was midway through shampooing my hair when I felt something. Like a sixth sense something-ain’t-quite-right-here type of something. I look up above me, and to my HORROR, a black, eight-legged, piece-of-shit, shower-ruining, house spider dropping down its web towards me via the air vent.

Australian children are taught very young to stay away from spiders. It’s common knowledge that the black ones can cause extreme pain, seizures, death, so I know my daycare teachers would be proud seeing my 6’2, 91kg, naked male body glide through my sliding shower doors and onto the tile floor, covered in shampoo.

They’d be extra proud of me, without thinking, grabbing the toxic insect spray, and proceeding to blast the shower and spider, with a fallout cloud that would rival the scene from T2: Judgement Day.

I have checked the label and the poison assures me the symptoms I experienced are the worst it’ll get. My nose is ok, the bleeding has stopped. And yes, the spider is dead.

Technically all spiders are venomous just the majority can't do much, I collect tarantulas and I can tell you I've had worse wasp stings than a bite from one of my new world species, so far there's been no confirmed deaths caused by a tarantula bite but certain species can cause a lot of pain.

I did not need to know that they're all venomous, iiiih!! 

Alla spindlar (förutom något undantag) är "giftiga" men knappt någon kan påverka en människa för att vi har tjock hud och deras gift är gjorda för små insekter inte 80kg stora djur.

"Hurt" is a strong word for it, I personally only get really itchy and watery eyes or some minor breathing difficulties, I'm not sure how someone with allergies would react to it.
