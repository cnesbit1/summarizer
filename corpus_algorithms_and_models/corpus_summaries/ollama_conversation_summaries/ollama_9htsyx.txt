Here is the summary:

But his profile photo is sideways, leading me to believe he doesn't know wtf he's doing.

Oh, good catch! It’s either he doesn’t know what the fuck he is doing or he is as weird as he is inappropriate.

Seriously how do you facebook so badly? Like, you have to really try to fuck it up this badly. My 60 year old mother who never had a smartphone in her life didn't fuck anything up this badly.

A guy I went to high school with just recently did this to a girl I also went to high school with. Same background and everything except his just said “do porn”

I think the adjective is ‘perverse’

When I used tinder I would put my picture sideways so maybe it would make me seem more interesting and weird so they know what they’re getting into.

I must be friends with you because I saw this on my news feed about 20 minutes ago, don't remember who you are though.
