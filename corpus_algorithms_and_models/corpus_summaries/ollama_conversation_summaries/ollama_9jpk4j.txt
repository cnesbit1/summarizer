Here is a summary of the original text up to 250 words:

I grew up believing Noah's ark literally happened roughly 5,000 years ago.

Yes, because if it didn't happen, the bible is wrong, and what else is it wrong in?

The story happened, because if it didn't, the story is false.

God is infallible. Man is fallible. Nothing in the Bible is incorrect. Only how we perceive it or interpret it is fallible.

But... who wrote the bible...

I studied the bible under a phd in biblical interpretation and translation. There are hundreds of contradictions in the bible.

I take that back. Guess you can study hermeneutics and not see God's hand all over the Bible.

Just a heads up, archeological and historical evidence support that most of the OT was written under King Josiah by combining local legends to unite northern and southern israel.
