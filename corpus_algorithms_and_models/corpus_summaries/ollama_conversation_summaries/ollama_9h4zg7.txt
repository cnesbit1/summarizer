At least that's more interesting than old people complaining about the overgrown lawn a couple streets over. Pretty creepy though.

A glorious shitshow erupted in ours a few weeks ago when somebody posted complaining about noise coming from the motocross track near their house. The track has been there for like 40 years and dirtbikes are a pretty big thing in our community.

We have a huge drug problem in our town (the NYT even did an article about the burgeoning heroin epidemic in rural California that mentioned us specifically) and a lot of people love that they can get their kids into racing that gives them something nondrug related to do on weekends and over summer.

Are you far in NorCal by any chance? This sounds like NorCal culture through and through and if it is, lol @ expecting quiet by any racetrack!!

Does anyone redo driveways?  I don't want to pay someone if we have someone in house!

It's a bunch of people.  You can only ignore them.  If you try and explain that this is their livelihood and how these people make money, they try to turn it on you with a lecture on being a good community member or "they volunteer all the time for HOA projects!"

I stopped myself from commenting a few minutes ago but now I'm convinced we are neighbors.

I sure as shit am! Right smack in Humboldt
