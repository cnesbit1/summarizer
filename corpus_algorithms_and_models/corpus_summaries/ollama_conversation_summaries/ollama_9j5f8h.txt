Here is the extracted summary:

So let's begin with saying I'm definitely a bisexual. It happened over time and I think the hypothesis that porn makes you attracted to men as well over time is pretty true, for me at least.

I was not born attracted to men I kinda figured it out in my late teenage years.

Before I get to my point I'd like to say that I haven't had any gay or bisexual experiences yet. Not because of shame, but simply, I haven't had anyone actively hit on me (I've been told I come off as very masculine and distant so that might play a part) and I'm not the type to show initiative with men or women.

The problem itself lies in me completely losing interest in gay sex the moment I cum. like it's baffling it's so instantaneous.

This is not all that uncommon. I mean what you describe here is pretty extreme--but it's not really all that uncommon for something to go from sexy to meh after orgasming.

And there is an opposite phenomenon, where the hornier you get during sex, the more things that may not normally appeal to you become hotter and sexier.

I'd say that's how I am 100%, but one experience kind of changed it. not thoroughly though, I was more attracted to how things went and the atmosphere, the mood, the situation all that and less to the actual person himself, since I know next to nothing about him other than that I like how he looks and that we can barely communicate since he speaks broken english.

Also, you deleted that part but cocks seem like they're fun to play with haha
