I'm looking for a lot of aprimons. Of specific interest are the ones marked in pink on the [Special Balls tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hg_WT4lif9HjPLpXVwPDTK5oth-FOiS9GIANF8wmBfY/edit#gid=1445398424) of my spreadsheet. And there is a lot of pink on my spreadsheet (although you might have to scroll down a ways to see the bulk of it).

For trade, I have over 50 NA Tornadus/Thundurus codes. I am looking to trade each code for 3 aprimons. HA is preferred, but not necessary (except for genderless, male-only or female-only species, in which case I only want it if it has HA, since I cannot simply breed the HA on later).

I have a heavy ball Pancham, Level ball Larvesta, and Moon ball Orangru. I can trade you, but only Pancham has a HA.

Let me know what is a good time for you to trade.
