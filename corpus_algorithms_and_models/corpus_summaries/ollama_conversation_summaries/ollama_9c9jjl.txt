Here is the summary:

That could be bacteria with the blood and tissue discharge, in all honesty, I would see a gynecologist. They will be able to perform a more thorough examination.

Oh man I am dreading this appointment I have to make so fucking much. I know I have to see one eventually but it's so awful I feel sick just thinking about it.

Get a Xanax and take half, also go to a woman who was recommended. Also insist on a full STD work up while you’re there. If you’re insecure about that just say your ex- boyfriend cheated.  Cover your bases.

Find someone you can see without fear. Your lady parts need a doctor and they need one that deals with those issues all the time.

I'm a virgin, so no problems there. And what do you mean reccommended? By who?

You’re really going to want a Xanax though.  Maybe go to a regular doctor and get that script sorted first?

They’re great about this stuff.  For my first exam, which would likely include a Pap smear, I’d try to score a Xanax to calm down.  That or a whole lot of tension tamer tea.

Let me know if you'd like me to continue the summary!
