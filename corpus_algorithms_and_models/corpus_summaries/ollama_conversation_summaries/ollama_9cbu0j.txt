I'm in a relationship with my girlfriend for 3 months now and it's amazing, and we do have amazing sex. She was my first and I her first sexual experience...

We've talked very open about it and she knows it's not her fault, it's me being afraid of failing or just insecurity about keeping it hard, I have a very hard time giving in to my sexual drive if I'm not dominant...

How do you keep a clean head? You can still orgasm if you're not completely erect. Let her finish you off even if it's on the limp side. It happens.

I think I can't come with a limp one, I'm not circumcised and it's super uncomfortable and hurts if she continues with a limp one.

No problem. I just know I've done this a few times and if you use enough lube or if she's giving you head it shouldn't be uncomfortable.

It's really hard to, I tried so hard to do it but the thought of "don't fail this time" is killing me...

Personally I just try and focus on the fact that I have a beautiful woman playing with my junk and how much I enjoy a beautiful woman playing with my junk.
