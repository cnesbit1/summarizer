Here is the extracted summary:

I only believe in one God, but yes, it is possible that I’m wrong.

If we as humans are tainted by sin, we cannot remove that taint ourselves.

For God to remove that taint on our behalf, we must consent to that removal

I would be steadfast, as there is plenty of other things that I see as evidence

While I don’t deny the possibility of some awful trial putting my faith to the test, I would like to believe I would continue to believe as I currently do, and that my faith would be strengthened.

You never believed in santa clause? I find that hard to believe.
