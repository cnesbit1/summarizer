Here is a summary of the original text, extracted and returned verbatim, up to 250 words:

* Short of genocide, what do you mean when you say "get rid of the Republican party altogether"?
* Confused here, I'm a Republican and I am very much not ok with sexual assault of any kind whatsoever.
* Not a great recent track record. Trump, Moore, Porter, Manafort, O'Reilly, Ailes, this list goes on.
* At least the Democrats held Franken accountable and believed Flowers, Willie and Lewinski.
* Don't you remember Carville saying about Jennifer Flowers, "Drag a $100 bill through a trailer and you don’t know what you’re gonna find"?
* There is no moral high ground for Dems. This is pure political maneuvering.
* I can't believe we actually have people who think like him in the general population. It's just sad more than anything honestly that somebody could have such little empathy and put "winning' over what's right.
* Oh no, I'll readily admit to *despising* Hillary from the moment she stepped into the national spotlight (and yet I voted for Bill in '92).
* And no, I'm not talking about those bizarre accusations of murder and whatever else... I'm talking about her non-stop smearing of every accuser that ever came forward against Bill, and all the sketchy legal maneuverings she instigated against many of them.
