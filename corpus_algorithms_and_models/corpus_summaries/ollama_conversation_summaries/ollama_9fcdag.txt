Here is a summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

I told him that I was going to fail because of an exam on Thursday and I already failed a quiz. My cousin told me it was best to slow down because of all the homework, quizzes and exams from the other classes can cause me to stress.

Then rolls today. I finished my classes and was about to head home when I received a text from my dad. He told me to go ask a advisor about dropping the class and whether we would get a refund.

I did what he said, but this moment here is where I messed up big time. When I asked the front office about withdrawing, they handed me a withdraw slip and next thing I knew, I was out of the Human Anatomy class (looking back at it now, I made one of the most dumbest move ever).

He then proceeded to call me a useless stupid kid and question my actions before hanging up on me. I felt like shit there and then and still.

I know it was a really bad decision made by me. Looking back, I wish I could just rewind time and stop it from happening.
