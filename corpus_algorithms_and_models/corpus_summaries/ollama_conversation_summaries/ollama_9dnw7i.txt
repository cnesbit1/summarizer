Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

The amount of HD hate is insane on this place.
Absolutely not, speaking for myself of course. I think alot of it stems from the stereotypes of harleys being slow and heavy, which to be fair os a part of being more touring oriented.
I think the stereotype is less about the bike and more about the rider.. many HD riders tend to be assholes and hate on everyone else, regardless if they are fellow motorcyclists or not.
&gt; The amount of HD hate is insane on this place.

I think what it stems from, at least form me is that I'm only 34. I didn't grow up or experience the decades that have made Harley-Davidson legendary.
I think everything they do is reminiscent of /r/fellowkids because the generation that restored their heritage, or at least built the image they've been coasting on for the last few decades are starting to either quit riding or dying, and their image is being replaced with this lifestyle in a box company that also sells motorcycles.
