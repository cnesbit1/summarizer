Here is the summary:

Someone's never had to use Purolator...
Canada post used to be amazing, but that was before the massive funding cuts under Harper. It sure looked good on the budget for that year, but now everyone is paying for it with reduced service as less people did more work across the board
Have you ever had to use FedEx or UPS? Itâ€™s like quadruple the cost for the same / worse service somehow.
Isn't Canada Post a crown corporation funded by its operations? I can't find anything about funding cuts.
What's really annoying is now they fucking deliver your package then send a bill in the mail for duty fees, which all seem to have gone up lately. What ever happened to paying all that shit when you're making the purchase
