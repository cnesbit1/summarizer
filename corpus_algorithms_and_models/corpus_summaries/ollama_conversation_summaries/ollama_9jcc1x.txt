Here is the summary:

I think U/i_was_mistaken was probably right in the fact that she thought I was in the other lane, but nothing would surprise me. I was more focused on getting around her then to see if she was though.

They're attempting to **merge across 4 lanes of traffic**, they're watching the yellow car and don't start to go into that car is clear, because they want to go into that lane. The left lane is the turn lane, and like a ton of self-centered, idiotic people behind the wheel - they "need" to cut across multiple lanes of traffic instead of making proper lane changes.

Where in the fuck does the video show that the red car was trying to merge across four lanes of traffic?

A *merge* is when 2 lanes come together.  
Changing lanes is not merging.   
The driver did not merge.
