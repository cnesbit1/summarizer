Hello! Looking to trade these codes this week and next week again. Primarily interested in Marshadow and other events (Gift Munchlax, Line Rotom, etc)

NA codes:Lugia code (10:1) - only need a few.  Rates can be adjusted depending on the demand and supply.

Thank youuu!

I have Z/TT/LL codes if you need any still. Would be interested in a Lugia code

Hello! I'm interested, although I'll have to give priority to those who commented first

No problem, if you have one left over let me know. I forgot I have a few KG codes also
