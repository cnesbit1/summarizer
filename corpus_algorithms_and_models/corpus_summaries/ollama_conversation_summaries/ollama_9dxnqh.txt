Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I advocate for equal treatment of LGBTQ persons in the civic arena not from my sense of the gospel but rather based on my 5th and 14th amendment rights to equal protection and due process under the law. Calling for equality stems from a constitutional perspective.

So much this. The position that MacArthur & co have taken on racial justice relies ENTIRELY on the settled opinion of past events. They've outlined no way of informing themselves on current controversies, instead choosing to only speak definitively on things that history has proven to be right or wrong. And then they have the audacity to accuse "progressives" of caving to public opinion to form their morals.

What did Paul do with Onesimus? Asked but didnâ€™t command him to release Philemon.

I'm just saying, the gospel can't be used to advocate for civil disobedience with the principles that Paul lays out in Philemon and later on in Romans about being subjected to rulers.

Romans 13's commands about subjection are subordinated to Romans 12's commands to love.

Setting aside for a moment that this is an unjust, uncalled for accusation, I think it would be more productive to stop at "pharisee" and let MacArthur stand as an example of how even someone with the strongest intent to uphold truth and godliness can be a voice in favor of oppression when they don't seek to understand and care for those who are struggling.

MacArthur crossed race boundaries in the South to minister during segregation.
