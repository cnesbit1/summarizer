Anyone recommending Richard Rohr to you does not know what he's doing or is not a very nice person. Rohr is a joke.

the gentleman i spoke to has a doctorate

From where? In what?
University of Florida.
World Religion and Theology.

Nah, Rohr is a solid recommendation. And in my mind a much better recommendation than someone like C.S. Lewis.

Rohr mistakes new-age vocabulary for profundity. He's a lot like Matthew Fox.
