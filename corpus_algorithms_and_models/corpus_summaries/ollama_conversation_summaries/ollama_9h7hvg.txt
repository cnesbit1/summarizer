Here is the extracted summary:

I host small rides through meetup (no charge of course) and have been wondering about liability. If a a rider went down, would I be held responsible? If yes then maybe I should put a disclaimer on the meetup page. Anyone else run into this?

Everyone rides his own ride, and no one should be held responsible for someone else's actions.  If someone goes down on a group ride, unless a fellow biker causes it, there's no one else to blame; certainly not the organizer.

I'm just confused as to how you can sue someone else for the fact that you lost control of your own bike and went down.  Am I missing something?
