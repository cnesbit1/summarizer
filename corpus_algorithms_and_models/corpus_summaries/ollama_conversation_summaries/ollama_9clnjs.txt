The two of them recently went to a one-day class about what to expect and how to deal with things as her body starts to change, and this made me realize that while I’m prepared “academically” I don’t really know how she’s going to change as a person in the next few years.

What are her needs going to be from me? Is she going to start butting heads with her momma the way that I did with my dad when I hit puberty? How can I support both of them?

I want to add, and I'm not saying you'll do this, but don't make her feel ashamed when she's on her period. When I was a preteen and living with my parents, I wasn't allowed to throw my pads away in any trash can inside the house.

Yeah for sure that’s not me, but thank you for the advice. I’ll do my best to never make her feel any different when she’s having her period, or to single her out in any way like this.

She’s the most amazing thing in the world, I’m lucky to have her as my daughter.
