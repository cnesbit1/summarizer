Here is a summary of the text in 10% or less:

The other night, I and my girlfriend were getting intimate. She started giving me a blowjob, which I really enjoyed. When she asked if I wanted her to continue, I said yes. Later, when she suggested we have sex instead, I agreed because I was still enjoying the blowjob.

She got upset with me for suggesting that it would be nice if she gave me more blowjobs. She felt like I was pressuring her and making her feel guilty. We had a fight about it, and she ended up saying that she only wants to give blowjobs when she feels like it, not when I want.

I'm wondering if I handled the situation poorly or if there's anything I could have done differently.

She should have communicated better with me about what she wanted and didn't want. Instead of getting upset, we could have had a conversation about our needs and desires.

It's unfair to imply that my girlfriend was doing this on purpose so that she could blow up at me. She might not be aware of her own behavior patterns, but it's still important for us to communicate directly with each other.

Here are some selected sentences:

* "I really like blowjobs, who doesn't?"
* "Another couple minutes in she goes 'are you sure you would rather do this than have sex' and I say 'I'm enjoying this and it feels great, but we can if you want'."
* "She got upset with me for suggesting that it would be nice if she gave me more blowjobs."
* "It's unfair to imply that my girlfriend was doing this on purpose so that she could blow up at me."
* "Healthy communication is direct."
