That rhymes with prick
That stands for douche.

Is he really a dick?  It's not like he's abusing her or anything, it sounds like he's just not attracted to her after her body changed, which is completely reasonable.

Although that's all contingent on exactly how that message was conveyed.  If she asked what the problem was and he confessed he's not attracted to her then that's good communication (though taking a year to get there is iffy...).  If he just threw out seeing a plastic surgeon then that's a bit dickish...

I honestly can't imagine any scenario where a good man who loves his wife claims to "just not be attracted" to her now, where this is in any way reasonable.

People get old. Bodies change. Accidents and illnesses and, yes, babies, change us. It is life and somehow over millions of years men have managed to deal with these normal changes.

Ah yes. He is a bad person because of the totally voluntary and completely self-controlled choice he made to not be attracted to his wife anymore.
