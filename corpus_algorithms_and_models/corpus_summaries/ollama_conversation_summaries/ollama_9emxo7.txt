Here is the summary extracted from the original text:

"You want me to stay?"

"No, you can just email me the video"

"I'll stay."
ARE YOU RETARDED?!
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY!?
YOU LIKE THAT, YOU FUCKING RETARD?

My favorite part was how dumbfounded the cop was at what happened. "Did he, uh.. did he just pass you? On the right?" He saw it and he still barely believed it.

Eh, I prefer gifs and avoid video, especially on mobile. I don't like waiting for the youtube app to load and oftentimes I'm in a public space and don't want sound anyway.
It was great. I loved how he just needed to confirm yes, he really did see what he thought.
