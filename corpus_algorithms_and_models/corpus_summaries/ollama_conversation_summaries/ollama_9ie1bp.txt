For a few days my back had been hurting, but I didn’t really care, as I was in my junior year of high school and I totally didn’t care enough. Worth mentioning was that I hadn’t felt the need to poo for a full week.

To understand the importance of that statement, one has to understand that at the time I would take a crap regularly, as in once a day every day. So when I wasn’t clearing my pipes, it was a matter for concern.

Back to the morning of February 23, I was in pain. I couldn’t sit up straight at school, I was constantly grunting to cope, but after the first few periods I was managing and it didn’t hurt me too much.

When school was out, I was feeling like cash money, and decided I wanted to take a nap. Generally I don’t like to wear a shirt at home, but at the time I was very into inspecting my abdomen to see how it was shaping up.

Anyways, after emptying the old trouser snake, I looked at my mirror and gave my midsection a peek. Instead of the sight of my normally rather flat stomach, I was greeted to my body being curved.

The left side of my body was considerably more concave than the right, and that’s where it lined up with the hurt in my back. Panic ensued as I informed my mother.
