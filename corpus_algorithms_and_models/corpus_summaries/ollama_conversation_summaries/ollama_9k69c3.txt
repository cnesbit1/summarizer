Here is the extracted summary:

He says he doesn't like it.. I'm seeing him again tonight should I ask him about it or let it go and just see how everything else goes?

That's pretty selfish of him if he doesn't want to go down on you.

If he won't do it for you then best you don't do it for him. If it's that important to you then leave him.

Oh ok. Then just talk to him about it and see what he says.

So when I went down on girls despite them not blowing me then they're selfish? No. Come on, how can you think like that?

If they are grossed out by that then what the hell are they having sex for? So how does that make sense?

This is not an argument. There are plenty of kinks people will not like and oral is one.

&gt;If he won't do it for you then best you don’t do it for him. If it’s that important to you then leave him
