Matthews same tier as McDavid.
On that note I’d say the people who say Matthews will make more than Mcdavid money because Toronto
I mean thats not that crazy. He could end up around 12 mill with another good year. Probably wont go over but he sure as hell wont be that far under

It is crazy. Mcdavid is a generational player whose put up back to back 100+ point seasons. Mathews is very good and will be one of the best in the game but he’s not Mcdavid. No one is. There’s no justification for him getting 12 or more especially when the other 1C on the team makes 11 and was a UFA and thus far better in terms of stats.

But the reality is that Mcdavid signed for under market value two years ago. Two years later, the cap has gone up and there is no indication that Matthews will similarily sign for under market value.
