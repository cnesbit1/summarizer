Here are the selected sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

lets get the CBC to make historical movies where all of the main characters are black, thereby rewriting our national history as black history.

I hope not it's pretty dumb. I turned it off when he started complaining that Idris Elba was cast as Heimdal, a fictional comic book character that has 0 reason to be any particular race.

So you turned it off after the very first example then. He gets to Guinevere like five seconds later. Not to mention Thor obviously being based on Scandinavian folklore, I'm sure the comics aren't where 'whitest god' came from.

You mean the same Thor based on Scandinavian folklore that has had an Asian main character since 1965?

Ironic because these were the leading "progressives" of the era.

Hogun isn't Aesir, though. His people were killed by Mogul and he ended up friends with the other Warrior's Three by happenstance.

Heimdahl, on the other hand, most definitely was Aesir.

Would you be OK with white men playing fictional Egyptian Gods?

Yes. Doubly so when like 90% of Egyptian gods are half animals anyways.

Which is an issue why? Because you would have preferred an Anglo-Saxon actress to play a fictional Breton queen?

By the way, fictional characters aren't historical people.
