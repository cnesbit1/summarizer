Jalen Ramsey said give him 6 months and he'll be able to play NHL-level hockey.....

NFL player said if he had 6 months to train he'd make the NHL.

All the NHLers laughed in his face

Jalen Ramsey, NFL player for the Jacksonville Jaguars, said that he could make the NHL with six months of practice.
