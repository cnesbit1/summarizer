Here is the summary:

In 2006, Cheney shot a lawyer in the face on a "quail hunt" on Armstrong Ranch, Texas.

Back in 2014, a mass grave was found in Falfurrias, Texas.

37 miles is quite a distance.. If it was 37 yards then I think we'd have something.

You're just making this look worse.

I hate Cheney as much as the next guy, but what exactly is suspicious about it?

Even the article you linked mentioned that a funeral home was just burying the bodies of illegal immigrants that were found dead from trekking across the countryside.

Cheney's face turned red with rage. He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the cartorid artery in my neck with his thumb.

He flung me on the cot-type bed that as behind me. There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.

37 miles is quite a distance.. If it was 37 yards then I think we'd have something.

Waaaay too far for a Black Suburban to drive. /s

I feel like I'm training AI here.

You could reason that separation between the grave and the "hunting ground" would be wise from a not-getting-caught standpoint.

How does my “contrived, disingenuous defense” make Cheney look guilty?

You know what I'm always thinking when trying to hide my crimes?  Why not increase the number and size of the crime scenes so they will be impossible to completely control.
