Here is the summary:

I have the following pokemon traded back to me, i have their items already.  i have 5iv abras and gastleys, other pokemon you might need to complete your dexs for trade.
- Slowpoke  
- Electabuzz  
- Magmar  
- Onix  
- Scyther  
- Porygon (upgrade)  
- Karrablast/Shelmet   
- Haunter, Boldore, Phantump, Gurdurr
If anyone has an evolved swirlex, Spritzee, and Porygon Z that would be great so i dont have to keep farming the battle maison
i can do!
Alright, just purchased the items :)
Should I get a second Up-Grade as well? Also, you said you have everything you need for the others so I can just evolve everything for you
