Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text (up to 250 words):

Hi all, I missed the T/T month, but have since managed to get hold of two NA codes. I’m PAL though, and so can’t redeem them, but I do have the Lati@s WiFi distribution this month, and am offering custom redeems of Latios on Moon, and Latias on Ultra Sun in return for a Tornadus and a Thundurus with photo proof.

I am offering two redeems for each code, or three if you are willing to SR for a Timid nature. You can also keep the Gold Bottle Cap that comes with the Latias, and I’ll add one to the Latios as well.

Any help would be very much appreciated!

Let me know if you are interested.
That would be great, thank you!
