Here is the summary:

Cool concept. Bad execution.
It's executed pretty dam well to me, if you're into that style. Evo engine, custom frame, probably airbagged.
Well I certainly enjoy that style (and other examples of it) but I wish the “bagged bike” could be made more practical.
Edit: I think a less exaggerated length, improved riding position (like look where the shifter is), fenders that allow for hitting a bump. Something closer to a traditional chopper with the fat tires and air suspension I think is what I’m getting at.
Wouldn’t the fact that it has like 1mm ground clearance cause a lot of problems if you tried to go anywhere
I have a similar seat on my cruiser (look up dragger seat), and that is the most comfortable seat I’ve ever had.   Shitload better than mustang seats
