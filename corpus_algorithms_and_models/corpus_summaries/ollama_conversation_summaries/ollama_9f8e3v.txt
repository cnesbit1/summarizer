Here are the selected sentences from the original text:

Many years ago, back when my wife (then girlfriend) and I were dating, we went thought a teenage "try everything" phase.

She suggested peeing.

So she sat on my chest and peed on me, grinding around... I loved it. When the time came for me to return the favor, she HATED it... so pee was out of the rotation.

I was terrified to share it; what if she thought I was gross, disgusting, thought less of me as a person?

But finally, a year and a half ago, on my birthday, I just told her.

She laughed, asked what porn I'd been watching. Made a Trump joke (remember his "scandal" with the prostitutes and golden showers)... then started talking logistics.

Now, about once a week or so, she'll kill a couple bottles of water we'll toss down towels, and she'll squat over me. Pee in my mouth, all over me, concentrate on my dick as I stroke myself off. But she wants to be sure I get off, so she spends time giving me oral, playing with my ass, etc first to get me close.

It's pretty fantastic.   And would never have happened had I not just talked to her about it.

I know I need to just talk to him. Itâ€™s one thing to know what I need to do and another to do it. Your story gives me hope though!
