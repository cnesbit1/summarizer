Here is a summary of up to 250 words:

Entire island has no power and water and petrol sales are stopped. Every building is dark and no traffic lights or street lights are working. I'm overnighting at a 7-11 here in Obihiro near Hakurindai station.

Skies are clear and the night sky view is breathtaking at least...

Somehow if i am stuck somewhere, Niseko would be amongst my top choices

Are they selling petrol.in your area? Only 2 stations in my area are and the lines are massive. So I can't go anywhere yet.

Niseko is probably nicer than the somewhat rundown town I'm in...

According to google maps the the nearest few are probably at Kutchan station, a 12min drive or 7km walk away.

Update: passed by Kutchan, the petrol station has a queue of about 4 cars only. Seems to be operating fine.

Is it insensitive to ask if you got any good pictures to show for it?
