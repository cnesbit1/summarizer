Here is the extracted summary:

&gt;you're fresh
100% not how I would describe myself first thing in the morning.
My morning breath is horrible.
I have always wondered what people who partake in the morning sex do about this
usually our breath is equally bad so neither of us notice
When you're horny enough you won't even notice it.
Not all positions are face to face :)
Reverse cowgirl and/or doggy.  All of the fun without breathing on each other
I don't think morning sex necessarily mean you can go priory to the bathroom..
It varies depending on the type of toothpaste you use.
You brilliant bastard
There's a very wide range of bacterial concentrations in the mouth for our species.
No one here has heard of Listerine strips? Two of those, plus a glass of water, and you're good to go.
But the point of morning sex is being lazy and comfy! Getting out of bed =|= lazy or comfy.
Keep mints on the bedside. Provided you're brushing your teeth well at night, it's mostly just stale spit in there.
Try not consuming sugar or things that break down into sugars in your saliva. You're feeding your oral biome, which you're gonna do pretty much no matter what, but for some reason sugar feeds the disgusting ones.
Drink water! Seriously if you just have one big sip of water it will get rid of your morning breath. You should have water next to the bed anyways.
Using Closys or a similar breath mouthwash the night before all.but eliminates morning breath.
Yeah you must be a morning person OP. I'll have morning sex bit it's not my fav. I don't feel sexy or even awake until I've had my coffee. Lol
