Here is the extracted summary:

Thank you. I think I posted here because I need people to share my outrage. I’m not sure really. I’m just trying to be supportive and not overbearing.

OP please do not consider doxxing, it's illegal in some countries and won't help your case. I'm sorry for what your niece is going through xx

I don’t really love the idea of harassing someone right back. We don’t have plans beyond Keep niece safe and have video evidence of anyone doing anything wrong.

Make sure he gets clear audio and video of everyone involved. They need to be fully identifiable by video to prevent them from trying to claim defamation.

It’s a public space so almost all states allow it. But this state also allows audio. We are good.

I'd be nice if someone, maybe a friend, who isn't obviously associated with niece continues to record after she leaves to see if they change their behavior. Idk, I'm just hoping for any form of justice for this poor girl.

That's only if you are in a space with a reasonable expectation of privacy. At public events, you can be filmed without the express permission of all parties. That's why paparazzi photos are legal.
