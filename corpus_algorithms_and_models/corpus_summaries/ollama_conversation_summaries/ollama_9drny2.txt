I find this amusing because anyone who knows anything about retirement homes knows that theyâ€™re the only place on earth with the same frequency of rando hookup sexual activity as a college dorm, lol... This is true, and most people don't realize it lol.

Old people be fucking.

To be clear though, this isn't about retirement homes, it's about community living and keeping seniors out of retirement homes.  Also, as much as some people like to paint a rosy picture of retirement community living, most elderly people aren't looking at kicking back in a $4k/mo nice place that makes sure they get access to Viagra, they're looking at shithole government subsidized places that take all of their CPP/OAS payments and give them an allowance of $80/mo to buy commissary.

Seniors are *way* less prudish than most people assume.
Yeah, sorry I didn't think that was unclear. I didn't mean they chase the staff around, lol...though there are definitely both dudes and ladies who do occasionally.
Yes. Old People Sex. Its best not think about it.
