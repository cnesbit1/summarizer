Here is a summary of up to 250 words:

Didn't he "play politics" with the "hijab hoax?" At least the Tories have an actual convict to denounce...
Do you really think that demanding someone who kidnapped, help rape and then killed a child with a hammer to be in prison, not at a healing lodge is "leveraging" for "political ends"?

What about the protest her family is going to bring to Parliament Hill next week? Is that "leveraging a little girls brutal murder for political ends" too?

I do expect professional politicians to understand, though.. seeing as it's sort of their _job_ to understand.  If the Conservatives don't understand how government works, and what the delimited powers of the federal government are, and are willing to use a child's death for political leverage, how can they be capable of actually governing?

Let me suggest that people will take your politics a LOT more seriously if you guys stop trying lay every murder or crime committed by a brown person at the feet of the PM.

Why doesn't Trudeau denounce the justice system for not working properly like he did in the Stanley case?
