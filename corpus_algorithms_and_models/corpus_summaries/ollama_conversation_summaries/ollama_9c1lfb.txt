Here is the summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

Most likely a CB750 that has a lot of custom work done. Late 70's to early 80's.

Honda stopped using kickstarters in the 80s so just 70s.

> Most likely a CB750

Nope
No saying you are wrong, but from that how can you tell it's a 550 and not a 750?

Engine looks completely different. CB500/550 has those distinctive end caps, whereas the 750 has a smooth rocker cover enclosing everything. CB750's engine is more inclined forward. Other detail differences.

You're welcome. I just scrolled down the list of answers, rapidly typing three 'Nope's followed by a 'Yep'. Quickest way of settling it.

FWIW, my 88/89 Honda GB400 has both electric and kickstart from factory, so they didn't completely get rid of it.

I can assure you it's not a custom model, lol. It's a 125, not a lot to it.

It's in my flare, 2013 CB125E. And the models I'm talking about are all street bikes.

Yep!
