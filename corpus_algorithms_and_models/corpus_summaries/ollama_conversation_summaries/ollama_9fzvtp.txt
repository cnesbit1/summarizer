Sleeping naked when you're alone just feels so nice. Especially when you've just put fresh sheets on the bed.
I am addicted to this by now if I don't do it it takes me some time to sleep.
You should feel it when the cat rubs against your freshly shaved legs- sooooo soft!
No one tells you this stuff, but this is one of the little things you have to stop doing when you have kids. I haven’t had a perfect sleep in 11 years.
I hold sheets for that moment where I need a little TLC. After a nice long shower, all clean and with clean sheets... Like a spa, but cheaper
Now, what would this feel like if you were on ecstasy?...
Quite painful actually. I couldn’t stop dancing in bed and accidentally kicked the cat. She kicked back but without the leg hair, there was nothing I could do. I’m still bleeding and now my new sheets are ruined. 10/10 would ecstasy again.
And you’ve sprayed your pillow with lavender oil.
It's not a well known fact, but kids wont die by seeing naked people. Teach them that nudity is natural and not only associated with sex instead.
There’s honestly no such thing as sleep on ecstasy.
