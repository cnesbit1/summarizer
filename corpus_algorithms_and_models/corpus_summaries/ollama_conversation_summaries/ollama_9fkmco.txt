Eh, I replied but deleted it because it seems that things changed.  We are shipping them AFV's with weapons?  That's new.  Fuck that, I don't support shipping them weapons or ammunition.  The vehicles is one thing.

The arms industry can shed all of its jobs for all I care, if it meant that we aren't exporting death to literally the worst countries.

This is not fucking aid, they are paying cash.
