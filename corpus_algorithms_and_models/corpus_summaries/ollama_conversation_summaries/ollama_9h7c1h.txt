Can a person born and raised in a society that has a different religion say Hindu for instance, can these people arrive to their faith the same way a Christian does and can they have similar spiritual experiences that lead them to believe that their God is the one true god?

Thanks!

Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him.

I don't know that God is so petty that people who earnestly seek a creator god and follow the dictates of their conscious would be entirely denied because they got His name wrong.

It’s very possible to me that people born and raised believing in Muhammad or Vishnu genuinely believe their god to be true, and they arrived at that truth by using personal experiences, faith and being culturally raised with that faith...

My question is how can one actually prove that their god is real over another’s?

Right on!  So no one can actually prove that their god is real.
