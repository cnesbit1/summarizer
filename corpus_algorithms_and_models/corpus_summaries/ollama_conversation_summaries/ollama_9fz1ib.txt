Why would it be relevant? Do you think the women here are sex offenders?

No, it's not relevant. A post about a random woman doing something that has nothing to do with her gender isn't relevant. I might as well post about a woman on the bus blowing her nose or something.

Comparing sexual assault to someone blowing their nose on a bus is really stupid to be honest.

And what do you mean it has nothing to do with her gender? Or course it does!
