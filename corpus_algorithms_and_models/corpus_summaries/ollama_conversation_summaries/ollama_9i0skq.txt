Here is the extracted summary:

When someone sees a slippery slope between same-sex marriage and beastiality or pedophilia, that's a pretty good indication that they view marriage as a pairing between a man and his sex-object, not a loving bond between two consenting adults of sound mind.
Doesnt make sense to me though. I cant make that link. Can someone help?
She’s definitely not of a sound mind
The presumption is that person who says  "gay marriage will lead to paedophilia and bestialisty" is insinuating that the person believes marriage is primarily about the sex.
An example of a retort would be, "eh hello. Marriage, be it among two guys or girls is more than just legalising the sex. Why you think so far say until  sex this sex that with animals and children? Is it because you think marriage between men and women is just for sex?"
Neither an animal or child can consent.  Which suggests that marriage is not about consent if gay marriage is being equated with those acts.
Can you explain how the retort is considered a slippery slope?
Yes I suppose that is also a form of Strawman Fallacy, i.e. trying to counter Thio by defeating an argument which she isn't even saying.
For all we know, Thio could mean that the problem with recognising Same-sex Marriage, and why it is similar to similar to bestiality and paedophilia, is that It Does Not Produce Children.
