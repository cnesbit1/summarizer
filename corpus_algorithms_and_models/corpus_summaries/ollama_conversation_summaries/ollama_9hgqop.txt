For some reason when im leaning i feel my tires start to slip where that red line is and im not sure why that would be.

New tyres are slippery for the first 100miles or so. 

So those edges are still in that “new” period. That’s why they feel slippery. 

Only way to wear them down and gain grip is to ride them on the slippery bit. 

I call those edges the illegal zone, you have to be doing illegal speeds to be in that zone.

No they clearly aren’t new but if the edges have never been used then those areas are still “new” 

Think of it like you buy a toaster, keep it in its box unopened for 10 years. It’s still considered new.
