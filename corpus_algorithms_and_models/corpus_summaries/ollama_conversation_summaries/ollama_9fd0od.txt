Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* I'm really excited about all my new shop ball stuff :D
* So, just FYI. A friend of mine is getting me a full set of Sun Pattern Vivillon's, so don't look for those.
* I kept them in gen 6 even though the breeding is a lot more difficult because it seems that they lose their uniqueness if moved to gen 7.
* I'm less interested in the Vivillons since I can't breed more of a pattern.
* Oh yea, I should probably get you a request list for the Garden Vivillons.
* How about: Ultra Omanyte, Ultra Kabuto, Ultra Aerodactyl, Ultra Lileep, Ultra Anorith, Ultra Cranidos, and Ultra Kangaskhan?
* Sounds good! I have your Tirtougas and Kangaskhans ready for the Icy Snow Vivillon's.
* Just got Icy Snow Vivillons in :)
* Are you available to trade? I'll be awake for another 2 hours or so.
* Gen 6 first. I'll get online!
* We have 1 more Kangaskhan to trade in gen 6!
* Oops. No wonder you weren't in FP yet, lol XD
* Thanks for the trade!
* Really not a problem! Thank you so much again. These Icy Snow Vivillon's are one of my favorite patterns!
* So, I ended up getting in the River Vivillons a lot earlier than I expected (well, mostly--had connection issues in the middle of the trade, and then my trade partner had to go sleep, but I'll get the rest of the set tomorrow).
* Guess I should get you another request list. How about: Great Kangaskhan, Great Omanyte, Great Kabuto, Great Aerodactyl, Dive Kangaskhan, Net Kangaskhan, and Quick Kangaskhan?
* That was fast. I'll start breeding those for you today. Should have them by tomorrow (or Saturday at the latest).
* So, I ended up getting the Garden Vivillons early, too :o
* There's absolutely no rush on breeding, though. Take your time :)
* River set is complete :)
* Weekend is still looking good for trading.
* Finally have all 14 ready to trade! Let me know when you're ready to trade and I'll get online. We can start in gen 6 as usual.
* Awesome! I can trade now-ish, if that works for you?
