Here is the extracted summary:

That's definitely enough time, I mean all he really did was distribute a string of 1's and 0's.

Sexual assault covers a wide range of unwanted behaviors—up to but not including penetration—that are attempted or completed against a victim's will or when a victim cannot consent because of age, disability, or the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Intentional touching of the victim's genitals, anus, groin, or breasts.
Voyeurism.
Exposure to exhibitionism.
Undesired exposure to pornography.
Public display of images that were taken in a private context or when the victim was unaware.

Love how you minimize the hacking of about 240 people to steal their personal, private, intimate pictures and videos... and then distributed them over the internet, where the whole world now has access to these private things. It’s a complete and total violation.

I guess child pornographers are just spreading data too.
