Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I swear those are the ones who pan out. I remember Karlsson's draft he was a "work in progress" and looked like a child.

[Look at this little man baby!](http://www2.pictures.gi.zimbio.com/Erik+Karlsson+2008+NHL+Entry+Draft+Round+One+rwc4xMlgX22l.jpg)
I think its cause he's super young to be drafted too if I recall. Like barely made the cutoff? 

Its the same with guys like Jeff Skinner who looked insanely young.
Ya he had to be one of the youngest in that draft.
He seems pretty physically mature for an 18 year old though even if his face looks young.

SDA's main drawback is his skating so we basically have to hope Timashov and Mueller open up the ice for him. He'll need to work on skating a lot.

Timashov is a prospect I've been excited for since draft day in 2015.
He was a 5th round pick who's undersized but a smooth skater and some great offensive talent. Kinda like a diamond in the rough but he's still in the rough at age 21.
