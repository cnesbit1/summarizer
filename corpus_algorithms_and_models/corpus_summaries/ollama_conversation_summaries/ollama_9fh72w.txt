Here is the extracted summary:

All rates are you:me.

4-5IV HA Alolan Vulpix with or without Freeze-Dry (egg move) (Timid)

If you ask for a code it's equivalent to 2 breedjects

For a Master Ball I will trade 1:3 breedjects

My concern is, that I'm at work rn. I could trade in roughly 5-6 hours.

Yes of course I can trade around 4pm eastern until 9pm really I'm free all evening.

Alright. Seems fair. Did you redeem a Shiny Z yourself already?

Ok. That's fine. I'll take the code for 3 master balls

Great thank you! Reply to this comment when you can trade
