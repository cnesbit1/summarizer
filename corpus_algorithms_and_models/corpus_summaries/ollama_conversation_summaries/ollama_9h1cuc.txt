Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

There are 4.7 million opioid users in Canada, and there were 3,996 opioid-related deaths in 2017 (these are not limited to overdose)
Even if every death was someone with an opioid prescription, which is not the case, that means that 0.08% of them overdosed and died that year
There are 25 million people in Canada with a drivers licensed, and in 2016 160,315 people were injured in a collision with a motor vehicle, or about 0.6%
Imagine if some alcoholics were suddenly dying more often due to their buying *poisoned* bootleg hooch that was *illegally* purchased on the black market from criminals
Claiming that opioids are killing Canadians is like claiming that bullets are responsible for the death of people murdered in gang wars
However, there's not much the government is willing or able to do, so instead they are capitalizing on the ignorance of the public to shift the conversation from one of addiction, foreign gangs, black markets, and the adulteration of street drugs with fentanyl to the legitimate use of prescription opioids
