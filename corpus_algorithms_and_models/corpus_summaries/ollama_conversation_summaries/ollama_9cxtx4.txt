Here is the summary:

Hey, I'm making a living dex and currently on Johto but I'm missing these 2 pokemon to complete it :( if anyone has either of them in a basic pokéball then I'd appreciate it and I just want to breed one for myself then I'll trade it back to you :)

Can you help with another trade back if I end up doing this? I need Tapu Lele for my dex and can get a Girafarig for you. I'll trade the Lele back, I just need the dex entry.

That's fine :) I'll trade for the Girafarig and end the trade, breed one for myself then trade it you back for my lele, is that ok? :)

Absolutely fine with me :)

Thanks :) I'll let you know when I have the egg which should only be a few minutes and I'll trade it back :) just let me know when you're ready to trade!

I’m gonna be heading on FP now :)

Alright, I'll head there now then :)
