Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text:

Yesterday I was driving home from work on the road I take to and from work every single day in my car and had a group of riders come flying up behind me. They all passed me on double yellow lines, then proceeded to slow to a STOP on a 65 mph road to let 4 other riders in front of me that were stopped at a T intersection, then continued until the next intersection riding wheelies and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic lane to get around one another.

Once at the next intersection, the same few guys that blocked the first intersection sat in the oncoming traffic lane to block cars (Again, 65 mph lane) to allow the whole group to continue.

There isn't an activity that exists that doesn't have assholes doing that activity any given time.
