Well, you nailed it. Something is in your tire.

Since I don’t know you though, pull out the staple, see if it punctured into the center of the tire, and if it did, throw a plug in that pig and do some wheelies. But don’t leave it.

Plugs are perfectly fine if it's in the tread and not the sidewall. It's not any more of a risk than the risk that you'll run over a piece of shrapnel (like a nail maybe?) and have it puncture your tire.

It's also cheaper than buying a yacht, but neither yachts nor hospital bills are fair comparisons to be made here.

Did you read my first post when I said that they can plug it? It’s just not my style. If I had a tire punctuated I replace the tire, especially with the speeds I tend to ride at.

Let's stop spreading this FUD please, it's just unfounded paranoia.

Pull it.  Plug it.
Bop it.
twist it.
pass it.
Shake it
