Wow! I absolutely loved this show as a kid. The concept was cool and the animation was unlike anything on TV.

Considered by many to be one of the better eras in all of comics, though there are always some questionable decisions.

Dinobot's sacrifice haunts and inspires me to this day. More formative than the death of Optimus Prime.

I had karate when that third show was going. Shadow....something. Never saw it. Same as insektors or whatever the bugs in the castle were called.

Fox = Beast Wars
YTV = Beasties

Legend has it him and PJ Phil are still in The Zone to this day.

Neato. ST is tragically misunderstood.

Amazing show. And it really does hold up to rewatches, especially past first season. The first couple episodes are def a bit kiddy but it matures and finds its voice fast.

IIRC you're referring to [Shadow Raiders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Raiders)
