I was at ACS where I met this man named Chris. I was there for treatment while this guy lived on the top floor in an Apartment. I was there for drug use and schizophrenia.

Earlier in my life I saw a vision of Blessed Mother Mary on top of our milking barn. While I was playing with him I kept saying in my head.. let me go I saw Mary. I took three outside 3 pointers and every time time I shot I thought the thought. If I make this shot I saw a vision of Mary.

After I missed all three shots he turned to me and asked.. do you know Mother Teresa? At this point I was like okay.. that was weird. We proceeded to play the game and later he wanted me to listen to these three cds.

I then went into his room and he wanted me to read this single page from revelation. I then read one line from the middle of the paper which read he who holds the world and handed it back to him.
