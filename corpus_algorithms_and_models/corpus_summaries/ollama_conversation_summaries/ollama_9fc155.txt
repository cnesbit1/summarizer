Here is the extracted summary:

Why would Reddit care if it gets more popular?
Because it's mods and owners are paid off by government to hide agendas. If they can't surpress it no spending monies.
Is that your fantasy? Mods and owners are paid to be against your slander?
Yeah I dream of it all day everyday. If you don't see how that front page of Reddit is manipulated man you're out your turret. 
My slander? Do you mean my right to free speech and to be able to say what the fuck I want when want.
Paid off by corporations and individuals. Government is just bought.
That's not really the case, although you can commit crimes with your speech. It's not the speech which is illegal, it's the intended real world harm which makes it illegal.
Hey man, no kink-shaming.
What these retards don't realize is that the effect of your actions are felt with a considerable delay, and at the point when visitor count starts dropping it is too late to change direction. Facebook and reddit are soon known in the same context as myspace.
