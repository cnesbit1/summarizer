Here is the summary of about 10% of the text or up to 250 words by selecting only sentences from the original text exactly as written:

*”But you’re a mother! How can you think like that?”*
*”You must hate motherhood!!”*
*”Why didn’t you abort your own child then?”*

What the hell!! So the moment you become a mom you automatically become Mother of the World and want every single conceived organism to come to life? Are you telling me that mothers cannot be feminists and supportive of others own decisions, as well? I hate people!

No, women that do abortions are realistic women.

I am already a mom. I am pregnant because I want to be mom to another baby. If this baby god forbid has a severe illness or disability that will give them no quality of life, I will choose to have an abortion. If this baby is born healthy and I accidentally get pregnant again afterward, I will choose to have an abortion because I will have all of the children I can realistically support.

It has nothing to do with my willingness or ability to be a mom.

Women with children have more abortions than anyone else.
