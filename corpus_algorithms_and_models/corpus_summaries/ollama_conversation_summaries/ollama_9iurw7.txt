Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I welcome Trump to try to push a NAFTA deal without Canada through Congress.
Congress won't cripple their northern states (the very same states that rely heavily on trade with us) else they risk upsetting their people, and not end up getting re-elected.

Trump most definitely would try, but that'll essentially secure that the upcoming election he won't win.
No matter how lucrative a trade deal with Mexico could be, the northern States would be hurt the most.
The effect of tariffs or of no trade deal on American businesses is overblown by the folks on r/canada.
We in these areas know that NAFTA killed jobs. But, with unemployment at historic lows currently, I don't think you're going to get the results you and other Canadians here seem to think will get.

These are states that flipped red. They flipped red because they knew Trump would fight for their jobs, and that's exactly what he's doing... What he promised he'd do for all those people in those states.
Rude.
That's the rhetoric but the data bears the truth - both countries prospered immensely and we have the largest, most equal, most fair trading relationship between any two countries in the world.
