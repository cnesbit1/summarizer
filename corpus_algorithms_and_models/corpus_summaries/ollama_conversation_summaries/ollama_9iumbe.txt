Here is the summary:

I've had my CBR600RR for 4 years now and rode an FZ6 for a couple years before that but I've never taken either to a track. My main concern is giving it too much throttle and high-siding on a corner exit.

50% because I don't want to total the bike and 50% because I don't want to total my body.

I think it'd be pretty hard to break the rear loose by giving a 300 too much throttle. Not sure it would even have enough power to do it unless you're practically dragging elbow already.

Yeah that's pretty much what I'm trying to decide.

What makes you think that you wont get hurt if you fly off on a 300/400 dude. stop drinking this dumb ass subreddits kool aid a 600 is fine especially if youve been riding that 600 for years.

If you are worried about the bike you should pick up a cheap bike and make it a track bike.

I think it'd be harder. Not hard.

I dont consider the SV to be "slow"

Oh ya you're right about that. SVs get destroyed on straights by 600s but its the torque coming out of corners that gives it the advantage imo
