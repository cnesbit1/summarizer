Here is the extracted summary:

I find it stupid that youths nowadays are using the r-word. all the time.
The word retard. Its offensive.

What's the r-word, realism?
Rabak? Rabak!
Retard?
Really?
Rabs kebab?

why bother calling it the r-word if you're going to explicitly say retard

its understood what...very insensitive n offensive.

What are you, 55?

1) R-word could mean anything, which means using it in the first place is counterproductive, and which means it needs additional clarification, which brings me to my next point

2) Explicitly spelling out the word voids the entire point of referring to it as "r-word" in the first place

its offensive to people who are really mentally handicapped.

you can't change the outside, so try changing the inside? Take what people say with a pinch of salt. It's a great skill to have

You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded
