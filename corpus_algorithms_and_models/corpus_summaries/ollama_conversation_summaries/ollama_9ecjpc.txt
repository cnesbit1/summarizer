Here are the selected sentences from the original text:

Strategically, Trudeau should definitely call an election now before Bernier can mobilize.

As long as the media does such a poor job at labeling him he has a good chance of establishing his party as a contender.

You're seeing a static picture. You need to see the moving picture, and where it will be in a year's time.

My opinion is that if Bernier is given enough time to mobilize, given the strength of his grassroots support, he will replace the Conservative Party as the main challengers and could conceivably challenge for Prime Minister.

Ok... you have VERY rosy glasses. Bernier is not doing anywhere near the well, especially in only a year.

Either him or the Conservatives will end up further left than the Conservatives are currently (one of them will attract more right-leaning people, I don't believe either will end up more extreme than the typical Liberal-NDP paradigm), and that will bleed off blue Liberals voters (many of which contributed to the current majority government I believe)

Bernier has the grassroots support and political momentum on his side.

At first, they will struggle with funding and direction, but (owing to grassroots passion) will eventually reach a critical mass.

The moderate conservative will soon be asked to choose between the two parties.
