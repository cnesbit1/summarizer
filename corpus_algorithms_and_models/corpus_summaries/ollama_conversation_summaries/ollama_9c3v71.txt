Here is the summary:

It's essencially masturbating in the face down position and can cause problems in sex, like being unable to cum.
Face down masturbation creates a pressure and sensation that are unachievable in other positions (mostly because of body wait and the angle of the penis being pressed into the mattress/whatever).
Doing this and only this for long periods of time can make it difficult to find other sensations, like sitting up and jerking it, or actually sliding your dick into a vagina, feel muted and not as pleasurable.
Itâ€™s the same principle as death grip, with the added danger of the constant pressure and weight potentially causing nerve damage.
Edit: prone masturbation is frequently the way most adolescents, male and female, discover masturbation, but most people grow out of it fairly early on as they move on to other sensations.
