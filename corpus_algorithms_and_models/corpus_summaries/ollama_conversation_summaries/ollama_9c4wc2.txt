Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* This is not AMBIGUOUS, you lubed up dildo.
* He has his hand on her breast and is kneeding it. Seriously what the actual fuck is wrong with you? Do you do this to women? It's scary that you think that's appropraite.
* You can't be fucking serious. This isn't even questionable.. it's blatant, brazen sexual assault.
* There are four lights.
* Or maybe he's been molesting people for decades, and always gotten away with it, and so now the thought of getting caught doesn't even occur to him. That's how it went with Cosby, Weinstein, the Catholic priests, etc. It's the standard molester pattern.
* The video is 1000x worse. He keeps moving his hand in, and she is absolutely crawling out of her skin.
* How exactly does doing something blatantly equate to doing that thing blatantly?
* What if it was your brother, son, or cousin being accused? Would you love for him to be plastered as a groper nationally?
* As a Human with eyes,  if I saw my brother,  dad, wtfever etc. On live mothafuckin tv kneedin' a side boob than yeah,  I'd help plaster their preditor face around. The fuck is wrong with you?
* This isn't even questionable.. it's blatant, brazen sexual assault.
* He has his hand on her breast and is kneeding it.
* It shows that he was willing to grope in full public view. The rest is speculation, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if this guy turned out to be on the Cosby/Weinstein/Sandusky/Nassar level. And given what he just showed the world, it definitely bears looking into.
* This is not an attack on masculinity and male behaviour, as some of the comments on this site think it is. It is an attack on predatory behaviour, which is rightly so.
* If your goal is some d/l boob action, that would be the way to hug all your female friends.

* Just know most men do not like being touched by other men.
* Living on the edge, I can respect that.
* It's 2 fold.
* 1) She's like 5'-0" tall, and he's like 6'-0" tall.
* 2) When people get emotional (They're at a funeral), they tend to go for a full hug. They wrap their hands around someone. That's just the natural placement of his hand.
* Lol, isnt it crazy how people are overanalyzing this situation. I never seen anything like this. 99% of the comments are really pushing for the story that this priest is hand raping her on live television instead of trying to do his 'job' as best as possible because of three unclear images.
* He's like two feet taller than her.
* Under the arm side hug + boob touch. Ok bro.
* There's more than one video, one is at a better angle where the video looks just the same as the pictures.
