Here is the summary:

We were at a local beer and ale festival and she went to the bar to order a drink for herself and her bf, whilst at the bar she was subject to some suggestive comments by the bar man that then led to two other men at the bar joining in saying how hot she was and that she should be careful,  this friend suffers from anxiety issues and returned to us extremely upset and shaken by the comments of these three men.

A close male friend was at the bar at the same time and simply wrote the situation off as banter implying that my friend was over reacting and that's when it hit me. I am a 31 year old woman that has spent many of my 20s working in bars and have been groped on I don't know how many occasions (when glass collecting) and been spoken to like shit for many many years, being referred to as sugar tits or sweet cheeks rather than as a human and throughout the years every time this was challenged the guys involved would right it off as banter, this is not banter this is harassment.

Sorry to ramble but this incident really hit home how women are expected to put up with these comments and right them.off.as banter yet they make us feel like pieces. Of shit
