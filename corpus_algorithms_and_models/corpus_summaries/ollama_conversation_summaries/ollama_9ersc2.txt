Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

* Volcanion
* Morelull (or its Evolution)
* Solgaleo
* Marshadow

In return, I can breed you anything that you might need (casual only, can't do competitive spreads yet.)

Oh hey, it’s you again. Told your post was in danger of getting deleted, haha.

Anyway, I still have that solgaleo. I also have a phione I bred myself.

I have you added, and I'll hop on to trade right at the hour

What do you have for trade btw? Do you have masterballs, rare candies, or gold bottle caps? If not I’ll take apricorn balls

Do you want the shaymin?

Alright I'll send it next one

Thanks a bunch man!!

Oh no worries
