I'd been dating a girl, we'll call her Cheyenne, for 4 years (together since we were seniors in high school). Lived together for 2. We've had problems like every couple, but we've always worked through them.

This past May, Cheyenne got extremely sick and got diagnosed with Celiacs disease. She was in and out of hospitals for weeks. I was there with her the whole time caring and supporting her.

She planned a weekend with her cousin to go to Chicago. Didn't think much of it for she visits Chicago with her family every year. The Sunday she came home, she told me she had actually stayed in New York and stayed with a guy she was with before we got together.

One punch. A single punch from someone with mental problems off their medication and you gave her a criminal record for it. Unbelievable.

She made the decision to act like a criminal, so she can get treated like a criminal. We don't know the finality of the case and how it will even end for her. But she made the choice, she can live the consequences. Life is about the choices you make.

If the roles were reversed (a man hitting a woman) no-one would be defending him, he has been shoved verbally assaulted and physically assaulted ‘occasionally’ as he said ... no-one deserves that he done the right thing reporting her she is a danger and needs to be treated as such a ‘criminal’

Let me know what you come up with because I sure as hell don't know what this means.
