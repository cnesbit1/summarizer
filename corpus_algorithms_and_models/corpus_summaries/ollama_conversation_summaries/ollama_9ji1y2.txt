Nice little bike.
it's definitely not my ducati, but it's absolutely a blast to ride!
The stock exhaust is so damn quiet. I've ripped farts louder than this bike.
Some days I miss my nearly electric Grom.
The majority of time though, a louder exhaust isn't going to be audible from the people in the situations where you need to be heard most.
I get what you're saying. fuck the previous owner had a straight pipe and it took me a long time to save up for a two brothers with a DB killer.
