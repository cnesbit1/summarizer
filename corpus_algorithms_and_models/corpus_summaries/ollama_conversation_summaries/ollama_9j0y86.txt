Here is the summary of approximately 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

they admitted they took 7 down. whats this post about?

John Kerry famously said that he thought 7 was ["brought down in a controlled fashion."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsJjYwYOAA)

I think Silverstein was talking about pulling firefighters out of the building, since at that point there was no real reason to try and save it.

Nah, firefighters abandoned building 7 long before it collapsed. There was nobody there.

Listen to him. "A decision was made to pull it, and then we watched the building collapse". It's very clear.

That interview was from a year later. The timeframe of that comment is not clear.

What about John Kerry saying the building was brought down in a controlled fashion?
