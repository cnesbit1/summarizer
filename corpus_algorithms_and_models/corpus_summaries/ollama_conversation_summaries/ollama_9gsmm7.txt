FISA just got declassified. We’ve heard about that forever from Q.

And it’s just a coincidence that Q said the MOAB would come linked to a red carpet event. Emmys were last night, same as FISA DECLAS.

Yeah, I’ve been hearing that shit since the military helicopters took over DC last year.

Yes, history is being made...while Pam makes $$$$ off the Q movement.
