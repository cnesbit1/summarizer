Here is the summary:

Hitler is not a worse sinner than you and me.

Yes he is. I’m sorry but I never murdered millions of Jews, millions of homosexuals, black people, and those who didn’t have blond hair and blue eyes.

Luke 18:10-14 - Jesus telling a parable.

“Whoever, then, breaks one of the **least of these commands**, and teaches men so, shall be called **least in the reign of the heavens**; but **whoever does and teaches them**, he shall be called **great in the reign of the heavens.**”

This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.
