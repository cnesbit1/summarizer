If compare the secondary school Chinese textbooks of Malaysia and Singapore side by side you'll realise that Singapore Chinese syllabus is really for babies
That's because Malaysian Chinese secondary schools are Chinese-medium schools. Something which Singapore used to have until the closure of Nantah in the 1980s.

Actually I was a dual Malaysian-Singaporean citizen and moved to Singapore from Malaysia mid secondary school education and had experience with both systems.

And most Chinese Malaysians do not go to private Chinese schools (seats are limited and you need to compete to get into most of those) but national schools. In Malaysia, many Chinese people mostly go to Chinese primary schools (SRJK (C), which are national schools, btw) but go to Malay medium secondary schools (SMK) due to it being cheaper and easier to get into.

Actually this could mean a lot of things. Primary Chinese schools are in quite huge numbers and easily accessible.
