Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text:

She came forward shortly after he was nominated. But wish to remain anonymous.

An assault is traumatic and having her character and life smeared in front of the entire country by the people that don't believe is what she wanted to avoid.

Maybe she didn't ever want to come forward because of the fallout she knew would hit her. She hoped she could forget about it. Then it became imminent that he could make it to a position of huge power so she was compelled to help stop that.

She originally spoke about it with her therapist in 2012, when there was still a Democratic president in office.

Probably to avoid having her life turned upside down, you know, like what has happened. She's received death threats and has had to move from her home. I completely understand why she wouldn't want that attention.

Let's not forget that the President has already said that there were good people at a Neo Nazi rally, so it's not crazy to think one of his supporters might be violent toward somebody who speaks up against his agenda.

She is accusing someone publicly. She should not get to do it anonymously in the public sphere.
