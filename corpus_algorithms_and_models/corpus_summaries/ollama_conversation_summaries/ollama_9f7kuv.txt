Here is the extracted summary:

Perfect term in my mind. Gives him 2 years to win a playoff series (even if he doesn't he's probably safe?) and/or have a Torts meltdown.

The only extension we expected to see from Cbus. No others looming...at all...

I'd assume most CBJ fans are hoping to lock up their star forward and franchise goalie long term

Panarin is in his contract year but it’s pretty clear he doesn’t want to re-sign

Or at least get something sweet in return for them.

I'm hoping you guys can sign Bob since I feel like the team would drop off hard without him.

Bob would be great I just don't want to overpay too much and be stuck with him and nothing else like some other teams that overpaid their goalie.

We also have 2 mini-Bob's behind him in Korpisalo and Merzlikins (who will no doubt be over here next season).
