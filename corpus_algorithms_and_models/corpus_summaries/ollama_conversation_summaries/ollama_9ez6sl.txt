Non helmet wearing riders, while you're in here, I've always wondered how you can deal with insects, small rocks, dust, etc hitting you in the face at high speed.

I wear an open face helmet with no windshield. The bugs and rocks are part of the experience I think. To each their own, (and not to sound like a 14 year old girl or something) but I want the smells and wind and stuff in my face.

You still get smells and wind with a full face. You also get to keep your teeth.

Lol full face helmets aren't air tight, you get tons of air. You can also ride with the visor open and close it on the highway like some (me) do.

Also why is it girly to appreciate nature? That's just being an human being.

Never mind the right size bug or rock to the eye and youâ€™re fucked.  Corneal abrasions are shitty.
