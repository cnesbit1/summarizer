Do you have any more pics of the build? What exactly did you change? Any balls ups or tips for someone thinking of doing something similar?

True but neither is the monster, since you're looking to build something similar to OP's bike I thought I'd suggest it as in my opinion it's a better platform ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

This handles better and is in my opinion a better off roader than the desert sled which I also extensively tested recently.   It was also built 8 years before it was released :p
