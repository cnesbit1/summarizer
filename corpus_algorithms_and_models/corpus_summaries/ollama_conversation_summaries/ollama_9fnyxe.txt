Here is the summary:

How do you takeover a country who's armed to the teeth and aware of your takeover plan? Trick them into being the ones who implement the plan themselves.

The election of Trump is the single greatest deception ever pulled on America in its entire history. Greatest in it's potential impact on the future of the country itself and greatest in scale at which it was implemented from several different angles and over the course of decades.

You give one president too much power. The next one can easily undo everything just by enacting executive orders

His supporters don't give him any power the people who sat home and didn't vote gave him power. You're only as strong as your opposition allows you to be.

Trump isn't even a real human being, he's just a reflection of his environment and right now, he's a reflection of the ugly underbelly of America. We're going to find out just how ugly it really is and it's not going to be pretty.

Yeah im cool with him being president over Hillary she called us super predators and her husband is the main reason were being mass incarcerated at the rate we have now on top of life sentences for non violent crime, ie three strikes policy
