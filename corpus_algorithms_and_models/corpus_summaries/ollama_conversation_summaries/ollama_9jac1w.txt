If this protest became a huge issue profit-wise (e.g. almost the whole city stops going to games) he would just relocate to the team to a place like Quebec City where they'll be so happy to have a team back they won't care how corrupt their owner is and won't boycott shit

Melnyk would likely sell to Joe Spano so long as he got his money up-front.

Just because I don't know a lot about business and relocating and shit doesn't make me an idiot, no need to be an asshole.

I'm an oilers fan, not a fucking Senators fan

So then don't fucking talk about the Senators when you clearly don't know shit.

What's my problem is that I have to hear people constantly talk about my team being relocated, and that the fans sticking up for their team will increase those chances.
