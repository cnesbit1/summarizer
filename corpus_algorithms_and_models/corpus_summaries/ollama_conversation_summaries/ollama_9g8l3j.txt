Here is the summary of about 10% of the text or up to 250 words:

- Choice Specs/Scarf/Band
- Focus Sash
- Weakness Policy
- Life Orb
- Mega Stones
- Leftovers
- Eviolite

Then name any of these HA Pokemon you want: [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wT0LOjWHax1vvLG-me99jGU9AdQSahajifqFWfutpPk/edit?ouid=117524942999790038747&usp=sheets_home&ths=true) I will be trading 2 mons per 1 item, except for Eviolite which I will be trading 5-for-1 since it can only be obtained once per game. Comment if interested!

Can I sweeten the deal by offering you more HA Pokemon? As many as you want that are on the list, actually.

How about Weakness Policy then?

Could I get totodile and klink?
