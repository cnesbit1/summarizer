Here is the summary:

Since metagross is one of my favourite pkmn, I really would like to have one of these.

I have some zeraoras OT:フウラシティ ID: 180713 with Jolly (from user **u/YosukeZ**), Adamant or Naive (both from **u/bebepupupu**) natures and they come with proof.

For codes I have 25 LL codes, 9 Poipole codes and 1 KG PAL code.

I am willing to trade a legit event marshadow

Origin: Marshadow Giveaway Event 2017

Where did this take place? It was a code distribution. I got mine from a GAME stop.

So you redeemed this Marshadow yourself? Yup
