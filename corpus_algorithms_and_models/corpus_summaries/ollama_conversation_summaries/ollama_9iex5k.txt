Here are the selected sentences, separated by newlines:

Dustin Byfuglien is about the biggest dude in the NHL. He's 6'5", 265lbs. He consistently ragdolls other grown men like they are nothing.

J. J. Watt is also 6'5" and weighs *289* lbs. Thats a solid 24 pounds difference between them. (For my Canadian brothers, it's about an 11 kg difference.) And he's pure cut muscle, too. I can't even imagine what kind of havoc he could cause leveling another dude on the ice.

we use lbs in canada not kgs lol

Weight is a weird one. Most Canadians understand pounds more than kilos but for our food we use grams instead of ounces. Also we use feet and inches for height, one has a clue what their height in cm is.

If we're filling out documents and shit like that than we use kgs and cms but for everyday life we use feet/inches and lbs

No, you were being considerate, which is awesome. How were you supposed to know that our measuring systems are super inconsistent lol.

And  Brock Lesner outweighs them both, but like JJ Watt, he doens't have the skating skills of a AAA junior player, never mind NHL-roster calibre.

Michael Jordan had every single skill you'd want a professional athlete to have--size, strength, freakish athletic ability, world-class hand-eye co-ordination, and the heart and determination it takes to succeed at the highest level of sports.
