Here is the extracted summary:

Hey guys.

Today I'm after a few specifics, namely
* Dream Ball, Grimer
* Dream Ball, West Sea Shellos (or Love ball, whichever you deem a better colour match for Gastrodon)
* Dream Ball, HA Clamperl

Like I mentioned in the title, got a heap of stuff to trade (can breed stuff too). so ask me and we'll surely work something out.

Cheers!

Hello. Any interest in my on-hand DBHA? Most of them were bred in gen 6, if that makes a difference to you. I've also got some on-hand DBHA (including Grimer and Clamperl) that are still in gen 6, but I can transfer them to gen 7.

I am mostly looking for HA aprimons that I am missing from this tab of my sheet. Highest priority ones are marked in pink, followed by anything I'm missing, followed by anything I have without HA.

...

Vivillon-wise, I reckon I have heavy and Lure currently with HA. I'm crappy ol' River pattern though, so I'm doubting you want that one ðŸ˜›.
River is one of the patterns I'm looking for, actually. If I can convince you to breed them for me, I would happily provide you with the HA apriball Scatterbugs you are missing, for free, and then offer you two PokÃ©mon for each apriball Vivillon (provided they are Timid HA females).

I don't know if I have enough stuff you are interested in to trade for a set of 7 apriball Vivillons, though? I would be willing to breed stuff, in addition to whatever you are interested in from my on-hands.

...

Alrighty, so for the 7 Scatterbugs could you do
* DBHA Grimer
* DBHA Clamperl
* Moon Wingull
* Level Relicanth
* Moon Chatot
* Moon Swablu
* Moon Cottonee

Is that a doable request?

...

Hey OK. No rush since I too am pretty busy this week. however, I can get the Chatot myself (I'm just being lazy :P) and the others it's also OK, I have the abilities and such, just not the ball, so it'll still help!

Looked at too many spreadsheets lately obviously. Could I change the Chatot to a Moon Shuppet perhaps?

...

Yeah sounds good to me and do the trek back to Gen Iv if you're feeling nostalgic.  It was the best after all!
