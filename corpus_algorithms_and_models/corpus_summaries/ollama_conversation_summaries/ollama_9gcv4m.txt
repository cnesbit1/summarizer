Here is the extracted summary:

Karlsson &amp; Price in today's era
Ehh talk to some devils fans about Price.
Do devils fans still hate price because of that palmeri incident?
You actually think Price overly tried to injure Palmeri, as apposed to letting out frustration and just sending a message? Genuinely curious.
Watch it again, he took one head shot and three more blows to the lower back....what was he trying to do with those lower back shots??? Give him a few bruises??

I honestly can't even think of one NHL instance where a guy tried to deliberately injure a guy. Even the Todd Bertuzzi fiasco was an accident; although it was reckless, I highly doubt he was trying to injure him.

You gotta be kidding me if you think Price tried to injure him lol.
Maybe price was just pissed off? Did that ever cross your mind?

You're insane if you think ANY hockey player ever tries to hurt another guy intentionally. Like I asked you before, can you name me ONE instance where a guy deliberately tried to injure a guy and succeeded? Good luck finding any examples because there simply are none.

You're delusional as fuck if you think Price was trying to injure Palmeri here, and there have been WAAAAY more contraversal/dangerous hits than that example.

What exactly do you think slimebag scumfuck Todd Bertuzzi was trying to do, give a little friendly show? How about McSorley, was he just trying to give Brashear a pat on the head?
