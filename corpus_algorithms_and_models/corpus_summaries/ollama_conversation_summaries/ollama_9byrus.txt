Was hoping someone could help me out with some Pokémon to complete my dex in ultra moon.
The Pokémon I need are 
Castform, Baltoy, Golett, Weavile, Vanillite, Relicanth, Misdreavous
Can offer a k/g code

I'm not sure what that code is, but I can get you everything other than the weavile!

Awesome I just added you on DS

Alright sounds good

Do you have the item razor claw?

You can find one... Somewhere.. Idr where. But the weavile i have is for the livingdex.

Oh, that'll work.

Alright cool, let me know when I should head to plaza
