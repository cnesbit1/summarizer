Here is the summary:

I love Reddit and I generally love the people here, but lately I have been feeling largely like I am intruding on a community that doesn’t want or respect me.

It’s starting to feel more and more like Reddit hates women and has no problem attacking women like a mob.

So many men are defending him and acting like a rape accusation is worse than actually being raped.

I am just curious if I’m the only woman feeling this way lately, or ever.

Reddit isn't a fucking person ..
where did I say that

And my point is Reddit isn't one fucking person....

"Reddit hates women"

Learn to read and write.
Learn the art of nuance ...

Because I'm not seeing what you are and you're pretending like Reddit has one thought.... Now it's all men that are at fault.

“not all men”, what a timeless classic.
