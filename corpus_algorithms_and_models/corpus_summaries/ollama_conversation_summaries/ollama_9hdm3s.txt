Here is the extracted summary:

So that dad wasn’t really into riding or he has another daily ride? I never really get those guys
Daily rides an GS500 (Or drives in winter), the CBX absolutely chugs the fuel being a 6 pot
Thanks for your reply. I suppose fuel in Germany is quite expensive.
I miss Aussie fuel prices...could fill up my GS500 with less than an hours worth of minimum wage work
Jesus christ and i got upset when gas hit 2.80 a gallon a while back
for comparison: Currently, where I live (in germany, I mean), a liter of normal Fuel is going for 1,35€ to 1,58€.
I´m Lucky my Marauder takes less than 3 liters per 100km. I can get up to 500km with just a single 15€ Fuel Tank.
It’s a good thing I’m not paying European prices for fuel...
They're also not really that good to ride.
