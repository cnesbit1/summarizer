Here is the extracted summary:

Hello samstator!

The user contacted me with the trade offer on my Tweet
I asked the user that several times throughout the trade discussion and also asked about save states this time around. They did state that no such methods were used to obtained the Arc and it was redeemed by the movie pre-order serial code

Do you know if that user edited, hacked or cloned the event in any way?

PMed a link... There might be some more stuff. It's a pretty long convo

You can PM me the updated link when you have a chance to do so.

Sure. I'm not at home right now. I'll get back to you asap

Also, the convo with @eru_to934 moved to LINE app after the initial 1st Zeraora deal.. Should I send screenshots of that too?

Yes please.

Sent Golduck and MImikyu. Will send the other 2 now..

Thank you for sending the information above. 

Please remove all of these off-site Pok√©mon from your spreadsheet and any pending trade offers.

At no point is cloning mentioned in this conversation nor do you receive explicit confirmation/answers from monpoke16 in some of your follow-up questions. You cannot assume this shiny Arceus is legitimate by our standards based on the responses you received.

You may appeal this restriction in the future after some time has passed and you have learned how to trade safely.

I will request tradeback for the Arceus and perhaps the MImikyu as well.
