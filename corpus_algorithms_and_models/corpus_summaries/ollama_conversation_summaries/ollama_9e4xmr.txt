I find the law in Singapore to be quite biased and unfair to men. Furthmore, men are required to enlist for 2 years and continue to be a reservist which definitely affects their career etc.

Women are *perceived* to be weaker, therefore they are *treated* better by the law.

Men are *perceived* to be stronger, therefore the law *treats* them worse.

So things like NS are men-only because women are perceived as too weak to handle it. Depending on how you look at it, you can see this as discrimination against either gender.

Well, yeah. But I believe that the more controversial and relevant part about NS, which is the fact that only men are legally required to undergo it, is the thing under discussion here.

For it to be a two way discrimination, men would be forced to serve, but women are seen as too weak to serve and cannot join the army even if they wanted to.

Men are perceived to be stronger

"Stronger" is a comparative. For one group to be seen as stronger, the other would have to be less strong, i.e. weaker.

Only "some". Yet *all* men are perceived to be strong enough.
