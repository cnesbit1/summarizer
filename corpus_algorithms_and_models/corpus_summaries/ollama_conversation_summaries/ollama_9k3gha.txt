Here is the extracted summary:

1. If you had to rank the top ten goalies in the NHL right now what would your list be?
2. 1. Bobrovsky
3. Price ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
4. Can't shit on him for one bad season if he shits the bed next season I'll drop him.
5. Price is a tough one since the question is about right now and last season was bad and the season before that he missed most of it with injury.
6. Interesting list. Didnâ€™t expect to see Gibson so high but he is one of the best goalies in the NHL.
7. Yeah but the season before he won the veznia and hart.
8. I totally forgot about hellebyuk he'd rank at 8-10 range
9. This isnâ€™t true. 2016 he was hurt, 2017 he was 3rd in Vezina voting and like third in Sv% for goalies with 50 or more starts.
10. IMO, Rask shouldnâ€™t even be on this list.
11. Am I taking crazy pills? Rasks CAREER save percentage is higher than some of those guys have ever even posted in a single season.
12. The man has only had one good season as a starter.
13. He was really good last season, but there are other, more established goalies with better bodies of work that I think you have to put ahead of him.
14. Top ten is tough because there are like 12 or 13 deserving goalies.
15. Vasilevskiy has at least had two consecutive quality seasons as a starter, though I do agree he might be a bit high at #6.
16. Nice to see a list not based on recency bias. Can't believe people are leaving price out completely
