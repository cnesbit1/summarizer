Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Actually, I was watching this French show on Netflix called Call My Agent. The main plot of the story is that the main character is an older accomplished actress. She is getting passed over for younger actresses for casting and sponsorships simply because of her age.

The agents at the talent agency tip toe around her trying not to tell her that the reason why she aren't getting signed is because of her age.

As a person living in France, I don't 100% agree with op's post as much as it sounds beautiful.

Business is business though. A society's values are not exactly represented in a TV drama.

Of course television will want to put the most beautiful people on screen.
