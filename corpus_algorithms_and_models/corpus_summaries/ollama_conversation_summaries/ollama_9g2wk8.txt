I don't think anybody ever even laid a finger on either of them.

Sean was a young, enthusiastic hockey player who was well liked by us old guys, and as you might know, was known for trash talking.

Never ever held a negative attitude about Sakic. Hated the Avs, absolutely despised Roy and Turtle. Grudgingly respected Forsberg and Foote. Would have been thrilled to meet Sakic.
