My husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911.

So we get into it, and he's spanking me and I'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. He's smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch "Ma'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight."

"Did you call 911???" My husband asked, "tell them it was an accident!!"

So I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says "we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

I said okay thank you, and I hung up.
