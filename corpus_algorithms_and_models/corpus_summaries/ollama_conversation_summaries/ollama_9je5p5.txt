My new (to me) 05 GSXR 600, cripple triple.  Picture is from a quiet track day at Thunderhill in Northern California
I'm curious how the 450's feel. Similar power delivery as the 600's, just obviously reduced across the rev range?
Great shot!  I had to look up what a "cripple triple" was, that's great.
Cripple triple? Was ist das?

Just looked it up. That's pretty neat.

For those that don't want to google it. It's a 600 IL4 with one of the cylinders disabled to effectively make it a 450 IL3 with a 150 balance cylinder. Here in New Zealand, people do it to get a modern supersports into formula 3 and they are competitive. [Number 27 in this National F3 race was a cripple triple.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zijfYb3Yk0) Brilliant race, definitely worth watching.

Cam lobe ground off.
Damn, thatâ€™s super interesting, never heard of anything like that.
