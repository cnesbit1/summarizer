As long as he's not doing on public streets, I don't see a problem with trying stunts.

It's quite popular with the stunt bike crowd AFAICT.
I think this is a case of play stupid games win stupid prizes. This is just me personally but I think tricks are dumb, "look Ma, no hands" was fun when I was 9 but now I just want to ride.

Also, if these dingus' are trying to "push their envelope" and learn new things then why don't they wear more protective gear? Hard to do dank whoolies after you smash your elbow into the asphalt.
The first guy looks be be wearing back protector. Given the low speeds, I don't think they're worried about road rash, and given it looks like they're in the desert, it's probably damn-hot.

I personally think that we shouldn’t criticize him for doing stunts and messing up, but we should still make fun of him for falling off it because it’s fun.
Schadenfreude is fun. Especially as it applies to the 2nd dude.
And to be fair in either persons situation i would be laughing hysterically at myself.

I have a couple (seemingly rational) issues with it:
1) If you're going to practice tricks, wear gear appropriate for the trick. I'm not here to sing the song of ATGATT, but if you're going to be practicing a move where you're standing on top of the bike, maybe more than a t-shirt is a good idea.

We're making fun, because it's funny. Funny because the bike rides on without him. Yeah that's physics, but sometimes physics is funny.
