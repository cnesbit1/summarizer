Here is the summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

At least the left doesnt pretend everyone they dont like is a satanic pedophile who eats babies. The whole political atmosphere is toxic though.

Some could say that's way worse.

Nobody is scared of purple haired edgelords.

Eh. I dont really give a shit about what people want to do with their lives. Not sure why other people care so much.

How?  Does that effect you in some way?

You dont care????

Then what inspired you to make this comment?

I also don't care if people want to think all the politicians they dont like eat babies. I think it's funny actually. Earlier I was talking about how its toxic on both sides. That's why I brought up that point.

Just for instance, ever heard of some dude that got his dick chopped off, voice regret? Me neither. Sounds plausible tho, I'm sure they are all 100% happy with that decision.

Oh I definitely do. I can still point out that both the right and the left are obnoxious these days.

While I do tend to agree, I had obviously mistakenly took your comment as support solely for Democrats.
