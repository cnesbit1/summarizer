Here is the extracted summary:

We know that the pinnacle of Christianity is not dependent on believers preferred political candidates, but our faith in Jesus and our personal endeavours to be more like Him.

Ultimately if someone dies a non-Christian it's because God has not given them the gift of perseverance, I don't think this can be blamed on politics. I've never met an atheist in real life who cited this as why they don't believe, in terms of issues driving people away there are much bigger ones.

Nah it's because of reason.

Well I think religion was a necessary social tool for pack mentality and teamwork in early human days.

That doesn't make it wrong, does it? I mean logic itself is a necessary social tool, otherwise we couldn't communicate practically and we'd all die, but I hope we'd agree that logic reaches truth either way. To say that religion developed for this reason is making a huge assumption, and to say that this is true for all religions would be very extreme.

It seems like you have some very admirable goals for the world, what standard do you use to say that they're good though?

My first name starts with an H, so it's H-man, then I was looking for something to add to that, so trying to be "so random" I chose 'chicken' for whatever reason.

I don't think denying all religion is more radical than believing a single (collection of) books with little to know outside confirmation is the ultimate truth to the universe. We have observed evolution of bacteria. We have Darwin's finches (Darwin was a Christian til his death). We have so much peer reviewed repeatable evidence that we emerged out of chaos, and 1 collection to say otherwise.

Maybe global citizenship is reaching too far. I think that if we want to stick it out for the long run we have to have a collective mind.
