Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* Even if a handful of professors in a few countries where unhappy I don't think any rational person would call that global outrage.
* Most people outside of Canada don't even know about this.
* Western World is like 40 countries, hardly a few. Multiply that by the average number of universities by country and you get 1000s of people.
* Do alt-righters post the constant stream of basic income articles here?
* Wow I never thought I'd see one of these in the wild. Have fun starving to death for your red hammer &amp; sickle in 50 years.
* So your hyberbolic idiotic comment about starving is backwards, BUI is what's going to save people from starvation when the world is even further automated.
* Germany tried it, and canceled it. Go study that.
* Spain is about to try it in Barcelona. Go study that.
* Scotland is about to try a version of if. Go study that.
* Most of the Western developed nations/economies want no part of it. Go study that.
* The problem is in applying one standard, broad and generalized "solution" (free money handouts) to what are in fact very specific life-problems (i.e. not everyone is in poverty for the same reasons).
* Just giving them money results in them incorporating it into their baseline economic framework, and ultimately it just raises the market costs of living (i.e. prices/consumer price index rises over time to absorb all that free money - leading to recipients demanding more money in order to rise above the new "poverty" line).
* Lots of problems with the study, lots of problems with the idea, lots of problems with the outcomes, lots of problems in government controlling it, and lots of problems with the issue of who - or what - is supposed to pay for it all.

* And on that basis these are the people that you want to give free money to?
* The homeless? yup.
* Then here's an idea. You go ahead and fix poverty by giving them your money (because the homeless are well known for being some of the best at handling free money handouts), and leave the rest of us hardworking taxpayers out of it.
* Lol.
* Enough with this age old Conservative talking point that colors this idea that the government is handing out cash in envelopes. It's tired.
* Homeless, as in without home or shelter. As in basic human necessity. Unless of course you haven't a trace of basic human decency.
* The beauty of a democracy is that because I also pay my taxes, I also get to help decide who gets what.
* Looks like more Canadians are choosing the basic human decency route.
* The Ontario study did not even include homeless in it...
* Which is a shame.
