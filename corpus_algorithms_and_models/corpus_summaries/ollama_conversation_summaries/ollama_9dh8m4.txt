Here is the extracted summary:

I am very insecure of my butt, it is small and which sucks as everything else on my body is really nice.
I am happy with my small breasts but I want my ass to be nice.
Whenever my ass is slapped or given attention to, I get insanely insecure and sad.
This sucks as I like sexy underwear and being spanked but my insecurities defeat it.

Are small butts a major turn off????
If you seriously believe your butt is too small you can change it by going to the gym 3-4 times a week.
A couple months if you work it properly you will see significant changes.
This and eating good! Meats and fat will build ya up real good !

Squats lots and lots of squats is the best way to a round ass.
I prefer a small ass to these fat ass things they are pushing now

That’s cool :) I don’t really pay much attention to my diet haha but I am still worried of looking masculine
You won't look masculine just by doing a light training program.

You simply won't be working out hard enough to even come close to a fitness competitor or bodybuilder level and that assumes you are working out hard enough that your periods stop and you are puking every day.

All that matters is what you want. If you are not happy with your butt because you are not happy, then do something about it. But if other people are in your life and they are telling you it is flat or that they don't like it? They can punch salt.
