Howdy! I got 15 NA poipole codes and am looking to expand my HA aprimon collection. I'm also looking for mythicals I don't have for my living dex. For HA aprimons, I'm thinking 6:1 aprimon:code, mythical ratio is up for negotiation.

Mythicals I'm looking for:

Jirachi

Deoxys

Shaymin

Manaphy

Darkrai

Victini

Keldeo

Genesect

Diancie

Hoopa

Volcanion

**Codes left: 13, Pending: 0**

Hi are Mythicals 1:1 trade for the shiny poipole codes? I can offer the following Jirachi:

That does interest me! Are you available to trade now?

Hahaha its now currently like 3am on my side so ive got to be sleeping. If we were to trade it would have to be like around 18 hours from now which would be like 9pm later. Got work in the entire morning and afternoon period so only night is possible lol.
