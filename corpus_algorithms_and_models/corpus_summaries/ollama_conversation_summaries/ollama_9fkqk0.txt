Blaming your perceived bad care on the entire country is unfair. Your issue should be with how your particular Province delivers your healthcare.

My question was sincere...when are people going to realize that the experiences in one Province do not necessarily translate to the entire country...and taking shots at the entire healthcare system, nation wide, does no one any good.

Unfortunately people don't seem interested in getting involved to improve the system...or even learn about it...until they find themselves in the position of needing it. It is shortsighted.

Watch your words. How you phrase things. Whatever you want to say about me, just take a second to look at that and say hey maybe I could have said that better and maybe that's something to watch for because the way I use my words may not match my meaning
