Here is the extracted summary:

Well, actually I guess you can, because they did.

There it is. An astronut saves the day -- again -- by plugging a hole in the space station with his thumb.

I'm surprised they don't put more holes in the thing, floating around in gorilla suits, playing rousing flute and guitar solos, etc.

Some will notice that this ridiculous story seems to be based on the "little hero of Holland" tale, where a Dutch boy plugs a leaky dike with his finger until help arrives, popularized in the 1865 book [*Hans Brinker.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates)

**But here's the thing.** Look at the photo Chris Hadfield posted of the hole that was repaired. See how it is marked with official NASA labels, like all their official photos?

Let there be no mistake: it's the same picture as the album cover of this 2014 contemporary Christian album:

For the unbiased observer, take note: this is why we distrust NASA and doubt the things they say they do and the places they say they go....  it's because they *unendingly give us pure bullshit, all the time, and constantly lie to us and mock us.* 

And the claim that the walls of said LEM were no thicker than two sheets of aluminum foil.
