Here are some extracted sentences from the original text:

* "I think speculating underlying motives isn't really productive here and insinuating what his intentions were with regards to how he values their marriage is probably going far beyond what he really meant and is somewhat dangerous commentary."
* "If he didn't value this marriage either, I think he would be a shitty husband in general, not just one offhand comment."
* "Then what's the point of defending yourself so hard?"
* "Sorry, but I'm a dude too and that's ludicrous defending that guy. You'd have to be the stupidest fucking man alive or just blackout drunk to say something that moronical."
* "I think one offhand comment doesn't make the rest of the relationship a failure. That's pretty dangerous thinking that isn't fair to the husband or the wife and their relationship."
* "As one final point, you're insistence on using that particular phrase only in the context of a logical fallacy is a bit ironic since the term 'begging the question' entered the English language as a mistranslation of petitio principii."
* "It really should be something along the lines of 'assuming the initial point' rather than begging the question, which makes a hell of a lot more sense than saying that a question is being 'begged' when a circular argument is being made."
