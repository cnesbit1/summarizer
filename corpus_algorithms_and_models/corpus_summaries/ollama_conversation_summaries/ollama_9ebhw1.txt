OT: MT. Tensei, ID: 100917, self-obtained on my copy of Sun, Jolly nature, EV-trained already (Max Attack/Speed), trained to level 58.

Let me know!

Hmm.. Do you still have wondercard?

Alright cool. Can you trade in about 12 to 13 hours from now?

That doesn't suit me unfortunately, I'm GMT+1 so that would be 2-3 AM. What other time could you trade?
