Of course I want a Metagross, just like everyone else.

Unlike everyone else I'm offering custom saves for US or UM (Custom as in OT and language tags) for NA or PAL regions (2 saves for a save-managed Metagross, 3 saves for a stock Metagross).

I can also offer custom shinies with either your TSV or my own ([OT]:Illaena [TID]:000000)

Yeah, I can do that. I'd RNG them with PCalc, NTR and 3DSRNGTool. So 2 shinies for a Metagross? I could send you a save to receive it on so I can redeem it myself if that's okay with you!

Alright! If you want more shinies, I'd be up for getting more Metagross haha
