Here is the extracted summary:

Little screw right under the right hand controls
Harley motors don't idle smooth. Might not stall but it would try to buck u off
Its because they can't be balanced and the cylinders fire at an uneven rhythm. Its why they sound like they do. It smooths out in its happy rpm range.
AHH, thanks for clearing that up!
At the RPM that an an 883/1200 Evo idles at, it will easily chug along when you fully release the clutch and at a smooth slow pace. It's not going to jerk you around or "buck you off."
That's what I originally thought, if the engine bucked and threw you around, it would be an unsafe bike, and therefore wouldn't be allowed on the road, so I was confused at that...
