Not today, but about a month ago. The shame has only died down enough to talk about it.

My husband works night shifts at the hospital a lot and so his schedule can be off even when he doesn’t work. This means he does a lot of house chores and errands at weird hours.

So, the fuck up - I was in line for the car wash the next morning with my dog in the back seat when I noticed this thing that looked like a squirt gun. “Cute”! I think. I pick it up. It says, “Pepper Blaster”. “Wow, it’s an spice grinder for camping, cool”.

WRONG. Apparently pepper spray comes in gun form.

It’s like a spring goes off and all of a sudden I’m covered in red. Did I shoot myself?! Is this blood? I’m dying?? And I’m sneezing. My dog is sneezing.
