Hello I am looking for NA Latios/Latias and Shiny Poipole codes. I will be trading 2 RNG shinies with proof from my [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRCCSYXVWiDi41oVc-6SM4QVfS0m_hy6J32jCJvxDlqG7Tsvhd4ja_8YMc48aq48P-15l2tTc_PJIO1/pubhtml#) for a code. I prefer the codes be PM as a photo of the card.

Oh BTW Rockruff is only for Ultra Sun and Moon since it's an Own Tempo one. If you only have Sun and Moon, then you'll have to choose another one.

I can trade now. I'll be ready in a few minutes.
