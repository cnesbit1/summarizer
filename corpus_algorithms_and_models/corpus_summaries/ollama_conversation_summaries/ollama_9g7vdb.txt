Are you demonizing family run businesses? Really?
No way. I'm asking why the people working dumb actual jobs weren't smart enough to inherit it like our hash-dealing premier did.
Hell, they don't even supplement their inherited income by dealing hash like our intelligent leader.
If they aren't smart and capable and talented enough to push themselves out of the right vagina, why do they deserve handouts like a living wage?
You're totally misreading me here. I have a TON of respect for people who get things in life by being born to the right people.
That's the way we should do things in society.
Interesting that you picked one party over the others when all their leaders inherited their prosperity from their families.
He inherited enough from his dad to make him a millionaire, and his public speaking gigs keep him wealthy, fear not!
He could have been smart like the Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford, and just worked from the inheritance.
