Here is the extracted summary:

As for RNG services, I want some perfect mons that'll hatch shiny :) I'll make a list of a couple wants tonight if someone is able to do it.

I can do the egg RNG (Using NTR) Feel free to post your list

Yes, it's possible to RNG gen 7 eggs

Also need an adamant recycle munchlax but I read you can get only get recycle on ORAS right?

I can do the first two. I'm looking for 1 code each.

Your eggs are ready. Let me know when you're ready to trade (Tomorrow obviously)

Ready when you are!

Good timing, I'll head on now.

No problem. trade completed.

BTW would you mind telling me how many you were able to get?

I have 10 more actually. Could possibly get more.

Are you able to RNG comp shiny legends on gen 7 by chance?

It's possible to do but it's pretty frustrating and can take a long time. Gen 6 (ORAS) is easier if you're interested in Legendary Pokemon transferred up

Hey can you also get me:
