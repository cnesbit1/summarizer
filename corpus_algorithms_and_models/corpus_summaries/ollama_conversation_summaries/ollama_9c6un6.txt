Parents are strict, Orthodox, and religious. Father is a priest.

But now, I feel so disillusioned. I feel guilty about this, but I simply don't believe in God like I used to. I despise going to church because it's too strict.

I don't know if it's just me losing faith or if I just dislike my church environment. What I wouldn't give to go to a church with a 2-hour service where I could sit...

I fear that if they continue to force me and pressure me to go to church, I'm going to end up hating Christianity.
