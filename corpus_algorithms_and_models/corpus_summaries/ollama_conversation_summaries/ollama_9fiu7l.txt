Here is the extracted summary:

When we have a documented, hate sub, that incites violence and encourages brigading and harrassing other users, not even get banned, it is obvious what is really going on with this shitty social platform.

Reddit is dying the death of a million shills, fake gate keepers, and paid discourse. What a shame this platform has become.

Literally banning communities that preached peace and unity, only to become banned and blanket wiped. Meanwhile TMOR is untouched. Speaks volumes.

Really does. Fuck you /u/spez and the shitty admins of this defunct dying website. You all have no spines and do not belong in America.

Anerica has become a political battleground that is filled with censorship and divide and conquer strategies. Dark days ahead of us. The storm is now here.

because social media has been monopolized
