Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

It's called 'Street Epistemology'. People film conversations in which they feel they have defeated and humiliated a believer, put them on youtube, and others watch and try it out, thrilled by the idea of using the method to make others look or feel foolish.

A couple of points that could be helpful: Faith is one of those things that is understood and experienced from within. It isn’t an of-this-world thing, so it can’t be persuasively expressed as an of-this-world answer to an of-this-world question (Why do you believe? What evidence do you have? Why your God and not some other? Etc etc.) That’s okay. The reason it’s difficult to give a persuasive answer is because it’s an irrelevant question.

Bullies don’t like picking on others they think can fight back.

I did, and I think the OP, like you, also completely misunderstands what street epistemology is, or is mistaking it for something *else* entirely. I [addressed the OP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/9k1bi1/the_street_epistemologists_currently_extremely/e6wgmx9/) in a separate comment.

So, with that said, have you actually watched any of the videos or read anything that Anthony has written about street epistemology? Have a look at [the website](https://streetepistemology.com/publications/street_epistemology_the_basics).
