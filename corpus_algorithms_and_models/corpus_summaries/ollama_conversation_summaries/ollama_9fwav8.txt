Here is the extracted summary:

so i told my parents about my gf. but i didnt really tell them that she's my gf but instead told them that ive been seeing her for awhile now. showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went "huh she's so ugly" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices.

also told me that she planning to make me meet her friend's daughter who she deem is prettier. I feel so offended but whatever. smh.
