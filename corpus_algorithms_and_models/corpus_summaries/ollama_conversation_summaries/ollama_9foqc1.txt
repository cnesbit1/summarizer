Here are the sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* Like I said, I respect your sexuality (not choice, I know), but respect my right to not support your cause.
* Just stop forcing propaganda down my throat
* The LGBT community isn't the biggest in Singapore. They need the support from friends and family to make their voices heard. 377A is an outdated law and should not be held over their heads.
* By all means, the LGBT community has a right to go out and garner support, but do not badger me (as some of my friends have done), for not putting my name down on a petition which the government is going to ignore anyway.
* Put very simply, your actions (or lack thereof) regarding 377A has no bearing on the sexuality of your hypothetical child.
* Yes. Sexuality isn’t a choice. Let me draw an extreme parallel.
* Homosexuality isn’t a choice. They are born this way, according to proponents of the LGBT community. By the same reasoning, proponents of paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia can easily proclaim the same. Bear in mind I am drawing an extreme parallel.
* Are we to say, let’s repeal statutory rape because paedophiles are born this way?
* The thing about paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia is simply that none of the victims (for lack of a better word) in the aforementioned categories are in any capacity to provide consent. That's why it's called statutory rape.
* Homosexual intercourse with another consensual adult is none of anyone's business except the parties involved.
* Therein lies mine, it isn’t paedophilia if it’s not underage, maybe we should repeal all laws regarding sexual intercourse with minors because they are born this way?
* Just because you are homosexual doesn't mean you can have sex with any person you want. You still have to seek consent first.
* People under a certain age (The actual age is a topic irrelevant to the discussion at hand) legally *cannot* give consent. Same goes for corpses and animals.
* Sex of any nature with a party that is legally incapable of providing consent is rape. This applies to everyone regardless of your sexual orientation.
* Your argument is a red herring, not a slippery slope.
