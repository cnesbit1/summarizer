Here is the summary:

wow dude WTF do you need a gun for? they're dangerous and not fun, you should be ashamed of yourself you crazy right winger!!

*signs on to overwatch and proceeds to play with guns*
Haha, thanks for the laugh my friend.  The irony out there is indeed something...

no problem, thanks for your responsible ownership.  I don't have a gun (I'd like to) cause I live in the city and wouldn't be able to use it without driving out of the city or to the range but I respect people like you who enjoy the rights this country offers, wish people wouldn't demonize you!

May I ask what city you live in?  Any indoor ranges you can use for target shooting with handgun or rifle?  

I am a member of an outdoor range, but my wife is a member of an indoor range so she can practice her handgun shooting (she is a registered Black Badge IPSC competitor) regardless of the weather (she is also a member of the same outdoor range I am).

Either way you should take the CFSC and CRFSC just to learn firearm safety and responsibilities and maybe for for your PAL.  It may give you an excuse to find a place to spend a weekend away from the city;  hunting, clays or just plinking in the bush.

I'm in Toronto, no guns for me here...it's just kinda shit for that...have a lot of left over guns back in Europe from the yugoslav wars, those are a lot of fun! LOL
