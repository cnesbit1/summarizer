Here is the summary you requested:

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
he was also fired from his current team, and mv agusta terminated their contract with him as well.
The problem is he's done so much other stupid shit like this too.
yes he did. he also burned basically every bridge he got to cross.
his reputation is done for. i don't think any team will ever pick him up again.
I thought he was done when he upset Rossi and the VR46/Sky team but he somehow got another ride, hopefully this is it for good.
Dorna/FIM should have thrown the book at him. That's attempted murder. Like another poster said what does he have to do to get a lifetime ban
You'd figure that getting the boot from the VR46 academy/riding team while leading the championship would be a HUGE fucking red flag to everyone.
