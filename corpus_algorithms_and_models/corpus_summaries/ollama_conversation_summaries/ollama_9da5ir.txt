An English translation of the Quran - 5:47 And let the people of the Gospel judge with what God has sent down in it. And whoever does not judge with what God has sent down, then these are the wicked.
I don’t feel like discussing it to be honest. I grew up the son of an evangelical minister and I’ve been around that bush more times then I care to count. I know it will just result in us talking past each other.
