Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.

Ok - simple question. Klim or Dainese (Specifically Two mesh textile jackets, it gets HOT out here) whatever you prefer

Well I have two jackets in mind but it’s more the case that I’m a Brit, living in the US. I’ve heard (obviously) a lot about Dianaise, but less about Klim so I’m seeing how the quality/protection matches up?

Klim is typically more American cut and is more utilitarian. Dainese is more Euro cut and... well, Italian haha.

Really, you should go to a store and just try them on.
