Here is a summary of about 10% of the original text, extracted exactly as written:

Sunday night my friend, we will call him Greg, texted me. He said he’s paranoid and super drunk, and this guy is walking around his house with a rifle.

I offer to come to his house and take care of him.

We agree.

Greg is sitting on his living room floor, laughing hysterically at how cute his dogs are, the gun is propped by the door, and loud rap music is playing. Looks like he’s been having a grand ole time.

He offers me a sip, and I’m like “Sure, one shot can’t hurt.”

*boy, was I fucking wrong.*

I’m fully clothed in a jacuzzi full of bubbles, wearing Greg’s motorcycle helmet (Pic Included here: https://i.imgur.com/80zq9Jv.jpg).

This is at 9:11 P.M.

Here is where the fuck-up becomes evident.

So, I take Prozac and Elavil.

For those of you who don’t know (much like my blissfully unaware self at that time) you are **not supposed to mix alcohol and antidepressants.**

I’m laughing and I fall out of the jacuzzi. Ouch, that hurt.

Spend the next hour grabbing my stuff and shaking Kyle awake to see if he’ll drive us home.

I get home by 7:20, take a shower to hopefully rinse off the ungodly scent that has implanted itself into my very being. I get to class at 8:30 still faintly smelling of vomit.

I’m still drunk.
