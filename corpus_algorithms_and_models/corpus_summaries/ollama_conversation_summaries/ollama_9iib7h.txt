Here is a summary of the text, up to 250 words:

The day before my parents left for vacation, they told me and my brother not to invite our friends over because we always got into trouble. After they left, I realized that my parents wouldn't know if my friends came over, so I invited them without telling my brother.

We decided to prank him when he got home from work by moving everything in his room two inches to the left. Then, we flipped over everything in the house and made it look like a break-in had occurred. My brother called me and asked if I had left the garage door open; I told him maybe and suggested he shut it.

When my brother arrived home, he was spooked by the dark house and saw the flashlight. He called the police, and they responded with lights and sirens. We were ordered to come out of the house with our hands up and get on our knees in the front lawn. The officers questioned us for 15 minutes while keeping their guns drawn.

Our neighbor came outside and vouched for us, saying we were good kids. The police eventually backed off and let us go.
