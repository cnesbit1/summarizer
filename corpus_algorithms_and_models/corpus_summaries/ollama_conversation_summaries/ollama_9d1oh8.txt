Lol this bike hasn’t ever been rode above 5mph since the new owner got it
You can literally see that there’s basically no tire wear...
photo couldve been taken straight after it was finished, or new tires...
The comment you replied to is still literally true.
correct there is no tire wear but that doesnt mean the owner has only ridden it 5 miles, he couldve ridden it 10,000 as far as we know
