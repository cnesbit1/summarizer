I have thousands of dollars of debt from University choices that didn’t pan out. The Government won’t give me benifits cause of it. Paycheques feel small and always far away. While the boss buys thousands of dollars of lottery tickets every month.

I’d like a change.
Then make a change. Your boss doing well has absolutely nothing to do with you doing poorly.

So use *your decision* to attend university for a useless degree to influence future decisions. No ones fault but your own.

Get a job that doesn't suck. You can always sell heroin , I see tons of people in Vancouver buying nice houses from being heroin entrepreneurs.

I have a job, asshole. I don’t need the government to “take care” of me.

Take some responsibility for your own life.
If I was on welfare I would agree with you but I’m hauling ass at my job every shift.

The point of what I said was about the income difference being so ridiculous.

I really hope other people don't think like you.
