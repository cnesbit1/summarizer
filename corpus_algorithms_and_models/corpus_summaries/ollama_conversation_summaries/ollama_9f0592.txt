I recently started trying out some dating sites and quickly found out how some men feel entitled to certain things.

The first example of this was when I matched with a guy who's profile said he was only a year younger than me, but in fact wasn't even old enough to drink. I quickly told him that I wasn't interested in dating someone his age.

He then saw that as a challenge to make me change my mind. He tried again a couple days later after no contact and I reminded him that we had already discussed this and I had given my answer.

The second time was after I had finally made some connections with people. We would schedule a time to either meet for a drink or coffee at some point. It would quickly change from them being friendly to expecting me to send them nudes.

After the first time he asked, I figured that would be the end of it. The second time he asked, I said no and did not get another response from him.
