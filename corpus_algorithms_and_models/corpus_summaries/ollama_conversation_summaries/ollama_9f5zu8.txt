Here are some sentences copied verbatim from the original text:

* I totally get that it is a cultural difference, its just mind blowing to me. Myself and the majority of people I know don't go anywhere without carrying.
* You never know what could happen, and your life is important, so why not have the ability to defend it in the most effective way?
* This whole 'defend your household' thing just isn't a regular conversation in the UK. It's such a different attitude here.
* To us, it's just a fact of the matter that guns shoot bullets and kill people. And we realise that introducing a thing made to kill people into any situation is more likely end up with people being killed...
* In the states we don't sign up to get robbed and we don't care if they are at the wrong house. Any house is the wrong house and we will shoot intruders.
* That doesn't make you a killer, that lets you live without asking for your intruders permission. Also you can send him to the ER with gunshot wounds and they'll be fine if you don't shoot something vital and they get put away instead of escape to rob more people
