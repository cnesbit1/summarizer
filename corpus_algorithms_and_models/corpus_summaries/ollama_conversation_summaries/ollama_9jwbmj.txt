Here is a summary of the original text, up to 250 words:

I think Feinstein was the worst. She should have brought this up privately with Kavanaugh weeks ago and they could have questioned Ford without her name being leaked to the public like this.

When Ford saw that he was a potential nominee, she brought it up to her representative, who told the president’s office.

This didn’t happen with Gorsich because he is a fairly extreme conservative but has a good personal and jurisprudence record, he has a level demeanor AND HASNT BEEN CREDIBLY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

If you watched the hearing you'd know that Feinstein respected Dr. Ford's wish for privacy, confident her office didn't leak the info.

Let’s face it, Trump is a stubborn guy. Once he picked Kavanaugh, there was no way in hell he’d back off that decision.

If it was one of her friends, she has really shitty friends. I doubt she would have left out something like “hey, can you not tell anyone I told you this” to a friend.

That's why there should have been an investigation rather than trying to hamfist his confirmation.

My question is how was the LETTER leaked. The letter that was supposedly sent only to feinstein was leaked before they went public.
