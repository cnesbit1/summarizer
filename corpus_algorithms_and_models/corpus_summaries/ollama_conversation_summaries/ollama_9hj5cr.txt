Here is the extracted summary:

Top ends of 2 r1 engines and a custom bottom end that can take them both like a v8. Then a custom camshaft. Or thats how i presume it would work. Id imagine it works much like a v8 in trucks.

Probably took a few hours to make ðŸ˜€

I was not aware you could cast something so huge like an engine block. Thanks.

Yes. Most engine blocks are cast the only exception being billet blocks. Billet is a block that has been machined to shape from a larger chunk of metal rather than casted, which is very expensive because you are paying for 1.) A giant chunk of metal and 2.) Hours and hours of machining costs.

Early versions of the Sherman tank from ww2 were cast.
