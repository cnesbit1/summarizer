Here is the extracted summary:

Hey guys, I bought a wr250x a few months back.
Everything was running smooth on the bike, but the chain was a little loose so I tightened it today.
I tightened it to the specs listed in the manual and tried rolling the rear wheel (it was on a stand and in neutral).
It rolled okay, but the chain was switching back and forth between being loose and tight.
Now when I ride it tightens a bit and it’s definitely noticeable.
Supposedly it was a new chain as well.
As far as I can tell the rear sprocket and the chain aren’t worn.
The chain doesn’t look rusty anywhere.
I forgot to mention that the tension varies depending on your suspension extension.
It just has to be in spec at all times.
Haha I understand.
