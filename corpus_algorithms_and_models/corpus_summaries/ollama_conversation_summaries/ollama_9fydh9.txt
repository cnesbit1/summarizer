Here is the summary of up to 250 words, selecting only sentences from the original text exactly as written:

Hello all! My boyfriend and I were just having sex when he said “Why don’t we try it without the vibrator?”  At first I said ok but when I started to feel close to climaxing I tried to grab it and I noticed he looked displeased.

I then explained to him that the media and porn make it seem like you should be able to make me cum without a vibrator and that he shouldn’t feel bad that I use one. He apologized and said he knew that to be true but still felt bad. I reassured him and we had amazing sex as usual.

However, I would love for people to leave comments so I can show him this later!

All comments welcome and thank you in advance!

TL;DR: my boyfriend feels bad that I need to use a vibrator during sex to cum. Leave a comment letting him know that it’s ok and that media/porn is wrong.

Edit: I’m fine with all comments.
