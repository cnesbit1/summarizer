I won't wash my hair after 10pm when everyone has gone into their rooms because it's too close to 12 am and if I close my eyes, Bloody Mary will come out of the mirror and get me hahaha. Sadly I'm not joking :( 

There is an episode of Psych that has a girl die because someone drops a toaster in her bathtub through a window and electrocuted her.

I am terrified of baths for an equally silly reason. I'm afraid of getting electrocuted with a toaster. 

You're not alone!! I'm more afraid a serial killer is going to break through the door though, I listen to too many murder podcasts and watch too many crime shows haha

I was literally thinking of that episode as I was scrolling through here!

So quick question, where would they plug the toaster in before dropping it through the window?
