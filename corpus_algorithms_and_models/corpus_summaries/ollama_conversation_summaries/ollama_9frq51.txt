My growling stomach and lack of a will to live at that point thanks to my job made the sound of both pizza and alcohol seem erotic.

"Fuck yeah, meet me there in 10 minutes"

10 minutes later and we got a seat and a beer at one of the outside tables. Now this pizza place was a kind of bar/restaurant gig, with all the tables and chairs being outside. They had the absolute best pizzas, cheap alcohol and a massive playground so it was routinely packed with families and students.

One other thing about this place: the pizzas take FOREVER. The prep work on the pizzas alone probably takes them half an hour. My buddy and I are on our third draft by the time the pizza comes. But man I creamed myself when I did see them come.

We proceed to slam back our beers and dig in. I down my entire brand new draft and feel the bubbles start to build up. Uh oh.
