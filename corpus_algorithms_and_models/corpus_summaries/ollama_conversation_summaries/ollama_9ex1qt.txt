Everyone loves showing off their bike and gear, so here is a dedicated thread just for that.

Got licensed and got a bike. 2015 FZ-09. I’m in love with riding! https://i.imgur.com/hcUwB0C.jpg

Best upgrade you can make for it are some new fork internals and a shock out back. Don't need to spend $3k on all new Ohlins everywhere, even the cheapest options sprung properly for your weight will make a **big** difference

New exhausts are fun, but in terms of actually improving the bike/rideability, it's not even close!

Thank you so much for the information! I’m looking into it now and also making an account on the forums!

Wow what a first bike. Enjoy that engine its a treat.

That's my favorite color scheme of any of the fz/Mt 09s. Beautiful bike.
