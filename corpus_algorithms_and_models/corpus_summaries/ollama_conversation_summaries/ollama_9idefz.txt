Here is a summary of approximately 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

I walked around the Red Light District (RLD) for about an hour before deciding to visit one of the girls. I agreed to pay â‚¬100 for two girls, Isobel and Katrina, to have sex with me. They led me to a bedroom where we engaged in a threesome. However, it didn't feel very passionate or intimate.

The next night, I visited another girl who was nicer and more friendly. We had sex, but she wouldn't let me touch her breasts because they were fake. She also insisted on inspecting the condom after use.

I concluded that if you're looking for a specific sexual experience, the RLD might be for you. However, if you need passion or intimacy before sex, it's not the place for you.

Some readers suggested alternative options, including brothels in Germany and Switzerland. One reader recommended visiting "FKK clubs" in Germany, where you can find naked women who are willing to engage in sexual activities. However, he warned that these clubs are not brothels and should not be mistaken as such.
