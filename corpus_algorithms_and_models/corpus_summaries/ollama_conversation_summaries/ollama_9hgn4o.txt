My period started. It was unexpected. I didn’t pack and tampons because it’s a quick trip and I haven’t had a period in a year- thanks Nexplanon.

But then it happened. And I sat in the bathroom, panicking. Do I shove toilet paper in my panties?

And then there were feet in the stall next to me.

“Hey - I know this is weird, but do you have a tampon?”

You didnt.

But you did leave the bathroom, find a quarter, come back, buy me a tampon, and pass it under the stall.

I never saw your face but you’re my hero today.
