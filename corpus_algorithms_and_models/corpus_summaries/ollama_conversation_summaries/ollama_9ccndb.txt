I got pretty mad at our Lord Jesus. I know using porn is a sin, but ......

Porn is cheap substitute for a real thing (relationship) and if I can't get the real thing my way I reach for a substitute. I'm a passionate computer programmer who's not willing to waste time by going out and try to get women to like me.

I don't expect you to understand. I'm just tired of waiting for the right lady I could give my affection to.
One thing to consider is that the women in those porn videos might not be there voluntarily. They could be supporting drug habits, the victims of an abusive boyfriend, sex trafficking victims, etc.

This is a misconception, literally all porn is from consenting people. There’s only the deep web stuff that is dodgey

I never said that. I said that **some** of it **may** not be consensual.

But I think if you make a statement like "literally all porn is from consenting people" you should have a source to back up your claim.

Sex trafficking isn’t that big a part of the porn industry, just illegal prostitution right?
