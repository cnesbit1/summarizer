So I picked up a bunch of extras Latias/Latios redeems at Best Buy today so I’m hoping to get some previous events that I missed.

I WONT BE DOING ANY TRADING UNTIL 8:30PM PST / 10:30PM CST / 11:30PM EST!! I work full time and that’s when I get home from work.

These are the events I’m primarily looking for:

- Shiny Tapu Koko
- Zeraora
- Worlds Meloetta
- Shiny Silvally
- Any event Jirachi

Is there anything else besides events that you would take? I don’t have any of them and really want Latios

Some shinies I’m after right now:
Espurr, Audino, Popplio and Mincinno
