Here is the extracted summary:

So sheepish were Disney and Mighty Ducks officials after the performance, they declined to identify the entertainer who portrays the Iceman. They issued statements about "company policy" barring the release of the entertainer's name and said, in effect, that they preferred that the Iceman remain the Invisible Man.

He's an experienced musician, a grandson of Academy Award-winning actor Wallace Beery and a North Hollywood resident. At his day job, he plays keyboard for Disneyland's Tomorrowland Terrace Band.

The Agoura High School graduate said he hopes the Iceman returneth.

Well that's good. But that still was only 4 years ago. The first article was from 25 years ago.

That article makes Iceman sound like the real-life Poochie.

"Afterward, MacKelvie sat in his car and cried, something he says he hadn’t done since seeing the movie “E.T.” He was, to be sure, The Crushed Iceman."

He really is a true King’s fan.
