Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

Who tf pulls off in the fast lane?
Someone who would pull onto a highway from a blind spot
Who the fuck builds a highway entrance with no merge lane?  All of America needs better highway infrastructure and much better driver's education.

And we all know we can't depend on other drivers to not hit us, so we need to be more cognizant and not hang out in dangerous portions of the road.

Yo for real though, merge lanes from that side are scary as hell. I can never trust anyone to not use that as an excuse to gun it and try to merge whether it’s clear or not.

Not saying it doesn’t work it’s just so rare we get that lane (at least in my area of the US) that people don’t know how to use it.
