Here is the summary:

Great read and shot. Sure it's preseason but that was against Taylor Hall shorthanded.
And on a quality NHL goalie
I know the Rangers wanted Pettersson but I don’t think you guys are going to be too upset with Andersson.
Damn what a year for rookies.
It’s gonna be so fun to watch these kids play and grow.
If it’s against a player of that caliber, in that situation, the stage of season is completely irrelevant. Hell of a goal
Andersson is going to be a gamer.
How the fuck do they roof it so easily. I'm like 3/48 on breakaways the last 3 months in my beer league cuz I'm fast but have no shot.
