Here is the summary:

Yeah, that was pretty dumb OP, sorry.  Good luck, maybe put the booze down for a bit.

This was the story of my life for basically my entire 15 year drinking career.  Deciding to quit was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

For what it’s worth, nearly 2 years sober and things are actually pretty good with me and my wife now.

Hey man, I can with relate exactly what you said. Just dont have 10 drinks.......binge drinking is terrible, and last year i actually quit for about 7 months.

Eventually, I just decided “I’ve had enough” and that’s the real definition of rock bottom to me.

Wow, our lives are very similar. One arrest, but always finding a way to justify my drinking.

That was really powerful for me. Ive done stupid Shit, maybe not this bad, and i tell myself, yeah rock bottom....two weeks later here we go again.

Yea man, you ever want anyone to talk to about it, I’m here.

No problem.  Just trying to give back what was freely given to me.
