Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

I have finally accepted that women have variable opinions on the size of a man's member.. it is liberating for a slightly smaller guy.... I wish I could have accepted this years ago......I never believed women could be satisfied by my penis or that size doesnt matter for some women.

Because it comes across as extremely insecure and thats not particularly sexy to most women.
It honestly isnt a big deal or dealbreaker most of the Times.

Size doesn't matter as much as you think it does. It's only an issue if you make it one, or if your partner is a terribly selfish person.

As a woman if a guy told me his dick size before we were literally in the process of hooking up, he would drastically reduce his chances of that ever happening.

Nothing selfish about liking big dicks.

You don't want to upset the mood or momentum of the moment with an unnecessary disclaimer like that.
