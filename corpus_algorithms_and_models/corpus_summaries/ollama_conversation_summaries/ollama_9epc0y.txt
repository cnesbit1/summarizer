A commenter notes that Canada accepted thousands of Syrian refugees in recent years and that Syrians aren't usually accepted through regular immigration channels because of the risk.

Another commenter argues that saying "refugee" when someone has PR status is a willful admission of facts, as coming as a refugee and acquiring PR don't mean you weren't a refugee when you came.

A third commenter notes that if someone isn't brought as a refugee, they would never have PR.
