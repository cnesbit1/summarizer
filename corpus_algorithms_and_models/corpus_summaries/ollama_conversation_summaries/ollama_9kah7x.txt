Here is the extracted summary of about 10% of the text (up to 250 words):

I'm a Flames fan, Gio is the heart and soul of the team right now but father time is not on his side. When Giordano eventually calls it quits, it sure is looking like our little shit disturber Matthew Tkachuk will be taking over as the captain for him.

Let me hear who you think your team will name to be the next Captain!

I think it will be Coots,TK, or Provy.
I doubt it will be Provorov. He doesn't seem to have that leadership spark to him. At least right now he doesn't.

In my opinion it'll be Couturier, he's 25 right now and has been with the team what seems like forever, plus a playoff hat trick on a torn MCL screams captain material

The hell is TK?

Edit: Oh just figured out it's Konecny. You guys need better nicknames
