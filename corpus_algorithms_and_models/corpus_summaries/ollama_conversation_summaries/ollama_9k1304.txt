Hi, I am looking for a 4 nature Fuura City Lugia redeem (Bold, Timid, Modest, Calm).  If possible, I would prefer a stock redemption with A button and WC proof!  I would be providing the code.

In return I can offer RNG TSV shines (Pcalc, CFW 3DS, checkpoint managed save, would be self bred) or a small amount of NA codes.  I have 2 T/T and 2 K/G.

I would also prefer premier ball flair or higher.

Code sent!  If it is not too much trouble, could you put both of our usernames in the proof?

Okay!  Are you sure you wouldn't like anything in return?
Nah. These guys are fairly easy. Although your nature is being stubborn lol

Oh, does this mean you can trade now?  If so that is good timing since I just finished up giving someone their GA eggs.

I'll go check out the giveaway in a little bit!
