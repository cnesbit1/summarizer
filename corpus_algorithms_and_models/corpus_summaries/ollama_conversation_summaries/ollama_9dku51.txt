Here is a summary of up to 250 words:

Pierre Dorion apparently turned down a trade offer for Erik Karlsson. Wants to maximize return.

Maybe he's hoping to gain some leverage from the trade deadline. But that's a risky move for sure.

To be fair, the pieces still could've been underwhelming. Three bottom six guys, three meh prospects, and a pick arenâ€™t worth Karlsson.

Maybe Dorion is banking on a team like the Bruins, who've had a very deep system the last few years, to be willing to move an established player, 1-3 good upside prospects, and draft picks at the deadline if anyone becomes expendable up front and EK is the missing piece.

I agree that it's a huge gamble but the market for teams who'll be able to do something like that will be mindbogglingly small.

Remember when this was said about Sakic/Duchene?

Dorion is playing the long con, in he's going to get conned, then canned.

Nope. Just nope. None for you.

The thing with this is Karlsson holds all the cards here. He's a year away from UFA where he can make the decision to go to any team that wants to sign him with money but may also not have the pieces to try to make a trade work.

We don't have enough information to have any kind of opinion on whether Dorion should have or shouldn't have accepted this offer.
