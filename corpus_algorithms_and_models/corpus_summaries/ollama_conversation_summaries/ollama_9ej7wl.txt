Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Recently I made the decision to stop shaving my legs (smoothness only lasts about 3 hours for me and I always get razor burn) and jeez Louise the comments I have gotten from people are insane. Funny thing is, they’ve all come from other women.

Why do people care so much about a woman not shaving her legs but don’t bat an eye at men not shaving their legs? I don’t get why people care about another person’s body so much

Well we men get encouraged to do it, too. I've had to shave for a couple chicks. It just is what it is. Shave or no sexy times lol.

Really, you men are encouraged to remove all the hair from the entire lower half of your body? Please, tell me more.

Lol, unless you *chose* a profession where you need to do these things, you don't have to. The social pressure eon men to shave is far, far, far, far lesser in magnitude that the social pressure on women to shave.
