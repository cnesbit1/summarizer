Here are the extracted sentences:

* If an associate says "no" to you, ask for their supervisor or manager. Write down all their names. It might be company policy to refuse the first request, because people are afraid of confrontation.
* This is an unacceptable business practice. I would be furious that they tried dinging me $300 without authorization.
* You should be angry. They charged you $300 for a fuckin load of laundry. That's a huge rip off.
* Remain calm, yet firm. Explain that you were never told about any cost for the service up front and it was not until after the service was completed that the charges, which still were not stated, would be added to your bill.
* You don't need to threaten to go to social media. I have never changed my approach because a customer made a threat.
* Be honest, tell them you haven't been informed about the cost and see what they can do for you. If they don't present a solution that you think is appropriate, go nuclear with "show me the order form or get lost."
* You brought them clothes and implicitly ordered the laundry service. In a restaurant you also don't need to sign an order so they can make something for you. You just ask the waiter.
* Maybe a law professional could weigh in here. Does a Hotel need a signature on a form to perform additional services like laundry? Even if you order stuff in the hotel bar and let them put the charge on the room they need your signature for it. I can't imagine it would be different for other services...
* Be a mean mtf this time
* It means li8few4.
* Same, I used to be a supervisor at a Hilton resort. I would raise absolute hell and if someone's not helping you, ask for their higher up. Keep going till you get the GM. We comp shit allll the time, $300 is a literal drop in the bucket. You never signed anything so you will NOT pay this. Repeat it till you're blue. You got this!!
