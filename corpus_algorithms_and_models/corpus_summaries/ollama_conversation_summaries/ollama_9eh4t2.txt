I have a lot of evolutionary stones and other evolution items. Which ones in particular are you looking for?

I am looking for Heart Scales, do you have any of those? They can be stolen from wild Luvdisc.

No confusion at all :) I am looking for as many heart scales as you are willing to get me.

Which stones do you have, I may not be able to reply for a little bit but I can use that time to get heart scales.

I am happy to trade any of these 1:1 for Heart Scales, if that works for you? And no worries if it takes a while to get the Heart Scales. I'm not in any sort of hurry.

I would like 1 thunder stone 1 water stone 2 leaf stones 1 fire stone 2 shiny stones and a sun stone please.

Tell me when you are able to trade

Okay, I just added your FC and am heading online.
