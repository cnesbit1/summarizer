What was he getting out of his van for there? That's not a great place to stop and those lights change pretty quickly.
Yep! Just turned left off Grey Street in South Bank.
No idea why he was getting out. He disappeared around the back from what I could see in my mirrors
Probably heard something rumble in the back and checked if everything was fastened appropriately.

Itâ€™s 100% legal in California lol
he was probs checking the van or load, nothing unusual
Yep! thanks! I cover it every time I filter due to these situations
