Here is the summary of approximately 10% of the original text:

1. I don't think Laine gets 80 playing with Little
2. I think he plays with Roslovic
3. I don't think he gets 80 with a rookie center either ðŸ¤”
4. Even worse.
5. Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up
6. A first wont be enough and I wouldnt want to give up a Vesalainen or a Niku.
7. Wtf do I know though.
8. That may depend.
9. Can't blame them for biding their time and waiting for the right moment.
10. Yeah I think if he does get traded he'll go to UFA regardless just so he can make a choice of where he wants to be cause he hasn't had the greatest luck personally the past few years
11. > Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up
12. if we're basing it off EK's value then Duchene will go for a 3rd round pick
