Here is the summary:

I think she might have just run out in front of him
He certainly says it enough.
she came out of nowhere

except where you see her walk off the curb and expect her to pop out between 2 cars. easy to say that I guess when we're watching it knowing what to expect, but when filtering it's hardly unexpected that something could come out between 2 cars
In the frame where she is separated from the crowd of people and starting to run across the street, she looks right. The motorcycle is clearly in plain fucking sight. She just dashed out.

It looked like she timed it to run out in front of him. Stupid. Hope she's ok and learned her lesson
