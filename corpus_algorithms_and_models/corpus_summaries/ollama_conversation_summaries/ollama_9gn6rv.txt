Here is a summary of the original text, up to 250 words:

"We had one miracle run with a sub-par roster and I'm expected to do it again"

Was Ottawa rebuilding? They were one goal away from the Cup final the year prior.

As an ex Sens fan, I can tell you that roster was anything but sub-par. That roster was very deep and very talented, driven by the unstoppable engine that is a motivated Erik Karlsson, and backstopped by Craig Anderson when Craig Anderson was *on*, and when Craig Anderson is on, he's one of the best goalies in the league.

Consider the roster that went to the finals, with the guys who are no longer here crossed off:

~~Hoffman-Turris~~-Ryan

~~MacArthur-Brassard-Stone~~

~~Dzingel~~-Pageau-Pyatt

~~Burrows-Wingels-Neil~~

~~Stalberg-Kelly-~~White

~~Karlsson-Methot~~

~~Phaneuf-Ceci~~

~~Wideman-Claesson~~

Boroweicki

Anderson
