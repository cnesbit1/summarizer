Sharks are now the Apex predator of the Pacific
And Oilers if they get their shit together this year.
Itâ€™s a tight race for the second Pacific spot
Vegas is in the Pacific.

One series.. theyve been top two in the division for like 8 years in a row
Ugh not if these California teams keep landing star players.

Ducks have no Kessler, a Corey Perry that aged like milk since Carlyle got hired, then you have to factor in Gibson's annual groin injury Ducks are below the SHarks, Kings, Knights in terms of power I wouldnt even be shocked if Arizona finally gets their shit together and out does them this year.

Anaheim has never looked this mortal before
