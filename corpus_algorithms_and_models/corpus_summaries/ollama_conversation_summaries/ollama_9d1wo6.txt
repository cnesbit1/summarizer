Like the Phoenix pay system fiasco the Cons set up the shitball but the Libs carried it over the line.
Uh Phoenix wasn't implemented until months after the Liberals took office, so no, the Liberals don't get to skate on by just blaming the Cons for that.

They both fucked up.

Which is why if it is a broken piece of shit with early warnings (which it was) you don't go ahead and say "yeah let's implement this as planned." Which the Liberals didn't do.

The Liberals grossly fucked up implementing Phoenix. The Conservatives made the horrendous program. So yeah, both suck and were shitty.

They both fucked up and the Liberals had a chance to unfuck it but didn't and now tax payers are on the hook for billions thanks to the Conservatives absolute incompetence putting together a payroll system.

Yeah, I see your point: they could have delayed the rollout.
