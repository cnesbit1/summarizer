Here is the summary of about 10% of the text or up to 250 words:

* HONDA CENTER (ANAHEIM): The area around Ponda seems a little low-key. There's several microbreweries and restaurants, but they seem to be more towards the baseball stadium or on the other side of the river.
* GILA RIVER ARENA (ARIZONA): Okay, this stadium gets a lot of shit for how remote it is, but it has an entertainment plaza with lots of activity right in front of the stadium, similar to LA Live.
* TD GARDEN (BOSTON): I'm not familiar with Boston, but the stadium is surrounded by highway ramps. That being said, there seems to be a lot of action directly outside the stadium. Great for some quality gameday grub.
* NATIONWIDE ARENA (COLUMBUS): I do believe this stadium is the crown jewel of Columbus' walkable urbanism. There's a lot to do around the stadium! Bars, restaurants, shops all within an arm's reach!
* STAPLES CENTER (LOS ANGELES): LA Live is the shit! A great place to hang out on gamedays. Lots of activities and fun to be had.
* BRIDGESTONE ARENA (NASHVILLE): Well, this doesn't disappoint. Museums, legendary music venues, plenty of bars and restaurants, and the stadium is close to it all.
