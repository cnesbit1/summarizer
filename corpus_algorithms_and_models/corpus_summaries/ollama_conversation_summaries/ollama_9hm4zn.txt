Here is the extracted summary:

Took nearly 700 miles but I finally made it the entire day without forgetting to cancel my indicators. I dont think I will ever feel this good again.

I’m all about accidentally hitting the horn when I’m reaching (my thumb) over to switch off the indicator.

Can't hit the horn if it doesn't work *head tap*

ride a BMW and know the true frustration of stupid indicator/horn layout.

Story of my life. Then people look at you like "wtf is this knob beeping about"

I swear that Honda has 2 different Horn/Indicator layouts that change randomly when I get on my motorcycle.

Glad to know it's not just me.
