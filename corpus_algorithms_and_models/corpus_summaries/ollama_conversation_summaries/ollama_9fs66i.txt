Here is a summary of about 10% of the text, up to 250 words:

3 teams have lost their captains this week. Crazy.
All Atlantic teams as well.
Canes lost 2 captains too
They got demoted to As and Williams is now captain
Jordan staal and who was the other one?
Faulk

What's your opinion on the situation?
My opinion is that Bill Peters's decision to go with co-captains was a wrong answer to a question where there were multiple correct answers. Faulk, Staal, Williams, and Skinner. But no, BP somehow came up with a wrong answer.

The entire debacle didn't make sense and frustrated literally everyone involved.
