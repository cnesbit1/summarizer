Here is the summary:

"understand the pain" - "who are marking today an event of enormous magnitude"

What a fucking asshole thing to say.

You don't think anyone is anti-Israel?? Have you been on Reddit for more than one day?

Well I was talking about Reddit as that what you brought up. Also she is just ignorant and doesn't realize the difference between the two.

The text is the evidence. The literal point was to “read between the lines”.

I'm not saying there weren't bombs, as that would be a simpler explanation and would make more sense when you consider other threads to the explanations, but I'm saying that I don't believe the free fall of the towers is conclusive proof of this.

Regarding the dust columns, you have to remember that all the air on each floor would have been compressed and expelled as the floors collided, which would have created enormous pressure and forces the air, and any dust, out of the windows.

That's interesting an interesting argument, usually someone who is advocating a controlled demolition complains about the building collapsing into 'its own footprint'.

I have seen this done many times for WTC7 when people were challenging NIST but I'm not certain I've ever seen it done on the towers now that you mention it.
