Here is the summary:

People are upset that a man we welcomed into the country, supposedly so he could have a better life, brutally murdered a *thirteen year old girl* who was a citizen of this country.

Imagine that, huh?

no people are upset that you use this one man to blame all refugees

So you suggest we dismiss the group's plea for tolerance towards other refugees?

I haven’t blamed anyone for anything.

Totally what I said, isn’t it.

ok? so then you agree with the article
