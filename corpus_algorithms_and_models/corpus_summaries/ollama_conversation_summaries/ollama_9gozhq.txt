Here is the summary of up to 250 words:

Its close between: Joe Colborne, Eric Gelinas, Cody Golobouff, Patrick Wiercoch, Fedor Tyutin, Andreas Martinsen...

That's the fourth name I see that MTL has traded for goddamnit

Remember when Colborne scored a hat trick in his first game with you guys and hype was real? Good times.

I do and while I didn’t think it was a Byron repeat I also didn’t think he would be able to de-throne Gelinas. That guy was brutal.

Martinsen wasn’t that bad, that being said I’d take Sven andrigetto over him every day

Lol you could make the argument for matt duchene, just considering how we played before and after the trade. I’m not tho cuz I still like matt
