Here is a summary of the original text, up to 250 words:

This happened last night, so technically it wasn't today, although activities may have extended into this morning. I typed it up right after a pregnancy test.

I'll start with how I met my girlfriend. We were at a summer camp, and things happened in that two week period that resulted in a relationship.

Speaking of Hurricane Florence, it was actually the reason she came over; for, two days ago, with odd motives, she had traveled over to Wilmington rather than California for the beach with a group of her friends, and obviously was in direct path of the storm.

I then proceeded to start telling my parents about this, where my dad just sat there silent and looking amused why my mom was getting increasingly infuriated.

Now the first night we didn't do anything really, just slept (me for about 3 hours) but the second night we did; I actually blame the person at my camp for giving me an way oversized condom because I brought Cards Against Humanity over and he had multiple condoms to give out.
