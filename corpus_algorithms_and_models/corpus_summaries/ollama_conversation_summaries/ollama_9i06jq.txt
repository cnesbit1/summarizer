Here is the summary:

People who know how to ride lol
On the track the rear brake can be used at high lean angles to allow the rider to  maintain throttle/weight transfer while keeping  and/or slightly tightening the line with a gentle application.
Riders like Kevin Schwantz won the 500GP world championship, and never touched the rear brake.
Anyway, it's a preference. When you see the riders coming down from 200MPH on the straights into the first turn, scrubbing off 100-150MPH of speed with the back wheel inches in the air- they are not using the rear brake.
Using the rear brake would be disastrous. It's only used at the high levels of racing for the things I mentioned in the start of this post.
Some racers choose to use it to alter their line. Anyone who races motorcycles is usually aware of what the rear brake can offer.
There are no motogp bikes that have no rear brake. So everyone uses it.
Wait what? I've been racing for a few years now and I don't think I've ever met anyone fast who trail brakes with the rear.
Rear brake is rarely used at anything other than the highest levels of racing.
Youâ€™ve been talking to the wrong people.
