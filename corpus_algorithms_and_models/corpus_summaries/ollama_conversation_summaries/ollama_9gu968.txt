Here is the extracted summary:

It's there [as a preservative.]

It's not actually mercury as you and I know it. Thiomersal (the preservative that contains mercury) is actually a different chemical of the following composition: C9H9HgNaO2S.

So it's a single molecule constructed of 9 carbon atoms, 9 hydrogen atoms, 1 mercury atom, 1 sodium atom, 2 oxygen atoms, and 1 sulphur atom. What's important is that this is one molecule.

Are you as worried about the Chlorine and Sodium (both deadly on their own) in basically all of the food you eat? Of course not, because when the two are a compound together they make salt.

Mercury isn't in vaccinations for the same reason toxic hydrogen peroxide isn't in water. A compound with a mercury atom is not molecular mercury.

It's not molecular mercury, it's thiomersal.
