The price of security is freedom.
And making that deal is not betrayal.
&gt;	Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.

It is.
The Canadian government sacrifices the freedom of its citizens not for their security, but for power.

Security and power are the same thing.
But now we get into the debate of what liberty is essential and what safety is long term enough to be considered non-temporary.
Is it?
A person in solitary is pretty secure, how much power do they have?
Freedom is power...
Then we would surely have the most power if every prisoner in solitary was free.
That assumes that they would work for society.
And we know that they likely wouldnâ€™t, thatâ€™s why we took away their power... 

Freedom brings power, power determines security.
I'm gonna go ahead and say none of you guys are making any sense right now.
That makes sense, I havenâ€™t slept in like three daze.

Your freedom or someone else's?
Which is a great quote for the internet, but no politician wants another 9/11 on their watch.
I'm always curious to know how these "well sometimes we have to torture a few innocent people for the greater good" types would feel if *they* were the innocent person being tortured.

Summary: 
Security and power are the same thing.
The price of security is freedom.
Your freedom or someone else's?
