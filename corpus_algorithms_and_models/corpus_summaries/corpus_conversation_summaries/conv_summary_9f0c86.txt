Original Response: 
The various arguments in favor of god's existence (the Kalam cosmological argument, Ontological argument, etc.)
have many flaws and are the subject of many debates.
What I'd like to hear your thoughts on/debate here is the issue of evidence.
My stance is that (whether inductive or deductive) there comes a point where the claimant has to provide evidence for what they're proposing.
Without that, all the pro-god arguments do is prove that the make-believe entity they're describing has arbitrary qualities that align with reality.
We can propose a million such arguments but without evidence such arguments can only be used to describe fictional creatures.
Take the argument from degree:  

1.
Objects have properties to greater or lesser extents.
2.
If an object has a property to a lesser extent, then there exists some other object that has the property to the maximum possible degree.
3.
So there is an entity that has all properties to the maximum possible degree.
4.
Hence God exists

All this does is claim that there's a pinnacle and that god (somehow) occupies that pinnacle.
But without evidence we have no reason to believe this is true.
All it's doing is claiming that one of god's arbitrary properties (perfection) aligns with the reality they're describing (a pinnacle).
We can sit down and do that millions of times in millions of different ways.
Dawkins' best summed it up as (to paraphrase)

1.
Objects have a smell to greater or lesser extents.
2.
If an object has a smell to a lesser extent, then there exists some other object that has the property to the maximum possible degree of bad small.
3.
So there is an entity that is the absolute smelliest of all!
4.
This supreme stinker is god.
Theists have been trained to think of god as an answer that doesn't need to be questioned.
That's just not true.
God enjoys no "free pass" from evidence.
The arguments in favor of god's existence need evidence otherwise none of them work.

Summary: 
Objects have properties to greater or lesser extents.
Take the argument from degree:  

1.
Objects have a smell to greater or lesser extents.
So there is an entity that has all properties to the maximum possible degree.
