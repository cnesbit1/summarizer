Enjoy the fights!
Get HYPE!
Wow what a shit card.
No fights with any implications.
Lil Nog vs Alvey could have top 5 LHW implications.
Why?
Both aren't even ranked at LHW.
So don't watch.
Twas a joke.
I won't.
I won't pretend 'implications' don't add to the fun, but so what?
Do you want to watch fights or 'implications?'
Well, these are average to below average fights, and the stakes are pretty low, so I'm not inclined to watch.
There are better things to do on a Saturday night, in my opinion.
If something noteworthy happens, I'll make sure to catch the highlights afterwards.
you see, if the fans don't want to watch then they don't watch, but they will want to watch......because of the implication.
*casual.
You know you could just watch the card for some great fights.
I watch every card and all the prelims.
What you dont realize is half of these guys blow up at some point.
Theres always great fights on you just dont know who they are yet.
You do you but I'm no slave to this sport.
#[**Hey everybody, u/ratazengo isn't going to watch the fights this weekend!

Lmao you cared enough to not only make a post, but also change the font, and link a random GIF.

Summary: 
No fights with any implications.
Do you want to watch fights or 'implications?'
I watch every card and all the prelims.
You know you could just watch the card for some great fights.
