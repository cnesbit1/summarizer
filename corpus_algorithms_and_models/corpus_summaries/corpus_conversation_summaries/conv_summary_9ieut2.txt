every one of those things also happen in Canada, except i have not seen application fees.
None of those things are legal in Ontario.

You ever get asked for first and last in certified cheques with the application?
That's become standard in Toronto.
You can ask for first/last month's rent.
Nothing wrong with that.
In certified cheques *with the application*?
That's essentially charging first months rent as a fee for applying.
It also prevents renters from being apply to apply at a few places at once.
Sorry, not with the application, but with the actual contract.
That being said, a certified cheque doesn't really exist.
I did have to provide a bank draft for first and last month's rent when I signed the contract for my apartment.
First and last with the lease is normal, asking for it with the application is a really scummy thing landlords do.

So what is my bank charging me $10 for then?
A bank draft/money order.
A certified cheque just is the bank signing off saying you have the money in your account at that time.
They've kind of stopped that practice.
A bank draft/money order is what is used and on a fancy slip.
They actually pull the money out of your account for those.
that is different from application fees.
remind me not to invest in rental buildings there.
You have to pay for certified cheques, and taking them with an application prevents you from applying elsewhere.

Summary:
