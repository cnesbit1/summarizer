Hi,We have recently moved to Corpus and are in search of an OBGYN for my pregnant wife, preferably near Ocean Drive around Everhart road.Any suggestions?
I love Dr. Pathikonda, but she is on the south side at Spohn South.
Also an aside, I have never had children so I cannot speak of her capacity in that.
Dr. Shawn Strain is an amazing human and her staff is great.
Guided us through a very difficult pregnancy.
all their offices are at Bay Area or Spohn hospitals.

You either have to go to spohn south on staples or Bay Area on rodfield.
Right now my OBGYN is Dr. Inman at Bay Area and she is amazing!
+1 wife loves her.
No nonsense Dr that Will not operate unless medically necessary.
I love Dr. Inman!

Summary: 
all their offices are at Bay Area or Spohn hospitals.
