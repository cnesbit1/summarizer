Original Response: 
Just wondering if star players who switch teams (to the better) usually perform outstandingly, or will it take some time to adjust?
If you can name examples this would also be helpful.
Thanks!
I could see Karlsson potentially scoring less.
He won't have to shoulder as much of the load, and potentially not have to always log quite as many minutes.
Of course it could go the other way and things click and he lights it up, but just a thought.
Tough to score in the pacific too.

I'm thinking that adding EK affects Burns scoring more, but who knows.
They could both get 25 mins a night and SJ forwards are good, so both d-men could go in the 60-70 range.
Youâ€™re just tryin not to jinx him ðŸ˜‰.
No, he's answering the question with reasoning and detail.
Not everything on r/hockey has to be answered with a bad joke or stupid comment.
Brent Burns has put up 67, 76, 75, and 60 pts in the last 4 seasons in the Pacific.
Karlsson will be able to do it.
It's tough to score in any division lol.
There is still only 1 puck.
I expect burns and karlsson to share the load.
Calgary had a stacked defence last yr and we saw how that turned out.
Not always a guarantee but i do think he will do very well.
And the person above you was just trying to inject some humor into the question.
Something you should try to do from time to time.
Maybe heâ€™d put up 90 in another div.

Summary:
