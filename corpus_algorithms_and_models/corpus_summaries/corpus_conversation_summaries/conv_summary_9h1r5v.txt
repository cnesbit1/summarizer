Heya!
Can I get a PCI1 Sharpedo for 20 NA Poipole codes please?
Hey, of course.

Oh no rush!
I can only trade in 4-5 hours anyway.
Ah, I see.

I can chase you some other time as long as you're not in a rush.
Yep, sounds good.

Just wondering if you're available now or for the next 3 hours?

I believe that's around the time you were available last time.

Also, I don't think you've sent me the proof for Nidoqueen?
Yep, I'm compiling those right now.
Thanks!
