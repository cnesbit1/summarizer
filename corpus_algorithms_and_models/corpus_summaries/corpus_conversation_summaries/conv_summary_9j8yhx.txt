The reasoning for a man saying no is not relevant.
No simply means no.
I know no means no.
I get it.
That’s not the issue.
Just the way he said it, I was wondering if that’s a red flag.
You've recieved the same answer 4+ times that yes, this is a red flag.
Why?
Because he sees that his money is going towards having sex, and that's it.
If he wanted to see **YOU** his reply would be "**Fuck yeah**.
This reply is old.
I’m just explaining to them the point of the thread.
And literally everyone is telling you this is a bad idea for the exact same reason and yet you keep asking for explanations and justifications.
Omg I asked this before ppl answered me.
The posts are old.
I was asking for multiple opinions.
Well hopefully now you have “multiple opinions” that all say don’t do it.
It doesn’t matter how big his dick is, you SHOULD NOT hook up with this guy.
Delete him/block him/drop him and move on.
Don’t know why you put quotations when I literally got multiple opinions lol.
Look kid, I don’t have time for this.
Everyone said the same thing.
They used different words, but they said the same thing.
👍👍👍👍👍.
👍👍👍👍👍.
Lmao ok and I’m not doubting that?
Multiple opinions can still agree with each other....you know that right?
LMAO.

Summary: 
I know no means no.
I was asking for multiple opinions.
Everyone said the same thing.
