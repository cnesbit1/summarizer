Ha, good catch.
Probably not her on the lower half of the screen.
Looks like it's two parts of the same video spliced together to give it one complete image.
The video and GIF produced by OP look fine, but spliced together like that it looks off.
she was also in Home Alone 3 and 8 Legged Freaks before she got really famous.
I remember her in 8 Legged Freaks.
I saw her in Ghost World too.
I mainly remember 8 Legged Freaks, and I only realized she played the sister in Home Alone 3 a year or so ago.http://i.imgur.com/3P5bK7w.png.

Summary: 
I remember her in 8 Legged Freaks.
I saw her in Ghost World too.
