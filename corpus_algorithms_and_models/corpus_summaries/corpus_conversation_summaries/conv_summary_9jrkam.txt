Original Response: 
I wonder how long the sizes of battery we use will be around?.
With 20700 and 21700 batteries.
How long is left for things like the 18650 or 18350?
Already I can't find a single OEM company selling 18350 batteries.
So, how long?
5 years?
2 years?
Any thought?
* 18650, 18350 will be around for a long time.
* You can not find an OEM for batteries, because no OEM sells to end-users, you need to check with sellers (from the sidebar) like illum, liion, or akkuteile.
* seeing as the production of 2*700 is tied up for years to come and the availability is really limited, I guesstimate it'll be more than 10 years at least.
I mean OEM wrapped.
Meaning they're likely all Noname Chinese cells.
Which is less than ideal.
Uhm.... OEM means Original Equipment Manufacturer... Not those shady rewrappers .)
Ok, so a Sony cell is in a green no description wrap.
The text varies from model to model, a Samsung 20s is light blue with identifying text and batch numbers, a 30Q is similar but pink.
These are their OEM wrapping.
I can only find 18350 in shady rewrappings.
This is less than ideal.
I can't say which 18350 are used today (Mooch wanted to do a test series on them), 6 years ago it was Tensai with their blue 10A cells.
But tbh I haven't looked at them again, because they were all rather limited in their capacity.
I'm using Vapcell 1100mAh 18350.
Hope they're not *too* shady.
I've liked Vapcell, still prefer OEM wrapped cells.
Same 350s I use.
 I would prefer them too.
God knows what will be under the wrapper next time I buy.
Love these cells for 18350 tubes!
If it's the same Vapcell label on the outside, they have given us no reason to think they change with no warning.
Nope.
No assurance otherwise, though.
When they got different cells for their 20700 3100mah gold, they sent the samples to mooch, as they were different.
The only info I have available to mean leans toward trustworthy.
Good news.
Thanks.
Its been like that with 18350s for years.
Not all rewarps are bad.
There are definitely some good 18350s on the market.
Hit up Mooch's links.
Yep do not think I have ever seen an OEM 18350...
