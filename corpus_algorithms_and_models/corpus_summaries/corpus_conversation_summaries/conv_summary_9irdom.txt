Original Response: 
A Tale of Two Chlorines

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please explain why I had a sturdy plastic bucket literally explode into fragments when I mixed 2 different brands of pool chlorine together?
I've never seen something explode like that when exposed to open air.
So what I would normally do is mix the chlorine with pool water and then pour everything into the pool, no problem.
One day we switched chlorine brands, so I poured the last little bit of the original chlorine into the bucket (there might have been a little water in the bucket to begin with) and topped up with the new chlorine.
I noticed vapor coming off the mixture almost immediately as I started mixing.
The reaction started bubbling and boiling and within about 10 seconds, the mixture started putting out a thick yellow cloud.
This was when I knew I had to GTFO, mainly to avoid breathing in any of the noxious fumes.
I can't quite remember if I was going to call someone or to get water to dilute the mixture.
I turned around and started walking and as I turned a corner about 5 meters away from where the bucket was left standing, I heard an incredibly loud bang and saw pieces of the red bucket fly past me and land in the pool and on the lawn over 10 meters away.
There was literally nothing left at ground zero other than a few white stains from the powder.
It was a really powerful explosion.
&amp;#x200B;

This happened quite some years ago when I used to look after the pool at home, so the details may be a bit sketchy.
I've always thought about that incident, what if I hadn't moved away?
I could have been permanently blinded, or developed some kind of respiratory issue, possibly even hearing damage?
&amp;#x200B;

P.S.
the brands were HTH and Clarity in that order (i think)

There was no outside contamination that I know of.
&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the replies and explanations so far.
I'm glad I'm not the only one surprised/confused by this.
Just a couple things, This *was* a long time ago like I said, so it might not have bubbled for 10 seconds, the gas might have been green instead of yellow, etc.
All I know for sure is that it was loud, it started raining red plastic bits, there was definitely no lid on the bucket and that there were 2 brands of chlorine in a bucket.
According to the MSDS of [HTH](http://fileserve.newporthigh.co.uk/Manuals/Volume%207%20of%208/Buckingham%20Pools/16.%20HtH%20Calcium%20Hypochlorite%20tablets.pdf), the source of chlorine for the disinfectant is calcium hypochlorite.
It also contains some calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate to keep the pH above 7 which prevents the creation and release of poisonous chlorine gas.
I couldn't find any information on Clarity as a pool disinfectant.
However, it is likely that the Clarity brand contained [Dichlor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroisocyanuric_acid) which is an acid based pool disinfectant (pKa = \~6 for the non-chlorinated isocyanuric acid - dicloroisocyanuric acid will definitely be much more acidic).
Mixing the acid pool disinfectant with the calcium hypochlorite produced green chlorine gas, which you observed, and a lot of heat.
&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: Are you sure Clarity is specifically a pool disinfectant?
I did some more digging and found a general peroxide disinfectant called [Clarity](http://www.peroxychem.com/chemistries/peracetic-acid/products/clarity).
Peroxides also react with hypochlorites to generate heat but oxygen gas instead.
This also removes the chlorine source giving dissolved chloride.
I'm now unsure how the chlorine gas (which it what you seem to describe) is produced.
&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Clarity is most likely trichlor or dichlor which produces chlorine gas and a lot of heat when mixed with hypochlorites.
This seems to be a very explosive reaction.
see this [video](https://www.chemaxx.com/pool_chemical_explosion5.htm) posted by u/Vew below.

Would this cause the explosion that OP describes?
It doesn't make sense to me since all he did was fill an unsealed bucket with water and then added these two chemicals to it.
Even if the gases auto-ignited, there's nothing to contain the energy, so no explosion could occur.
I don't know.
Chlorine gas is produced and this is the most likely reason why.
Whether or not the heat produced from this reaction would be enough to cause an 'explosion' in an opened container - I don't know.
The material sitting on top of the area where the reaction was occurring must have provided enough of a "seal" for the gas to build up and cause the explosion.
thats what confuses me about this too.
An explosion requires pressure which could be generated by sealing the container.
If the container was not sealed (like an open bucket) the chemical reaction would have to be damn violent and quick to increase the pressure enough in the open bucket to have it explode.
[removed]
Yes the dicyclo acid mentioned reacts explosively with strong bases.
Calcium Hydroxide is a strong base.
OP was lucky he's not maimed or worse.
That doesn't explain how it bubbled for ten seconds before exploding.
Any seal would have been broken by all the escaping gas.
It is also possible that the Cal hypo product added with the small amount of water added a lot of the heat too.
I worked for a pool company and the first thing they explained was how if you add small amounts of water to Cal hypo products they have a nasty tendency of catching on fire or exploding.
Since I'm not the smartest of people a couple of the other employees and me tested this and it quite violently set on fire I'm sure with the other product it just made it more violent.
[removed]
Yes, this is what I originally thought was the case for the OP.
It sounds like the OP added a whole load of undissolved hypochlorite which while dissolving will produce loads of heat.
It's the first error made in any chem lab.
People forget - dissolving substances (edit) can be very exothermic.
What is popularly called an explosion is simply rapid burning in a closed container until the container bursts.
There are a number of chemical reactions that create explosive energy release with zero containment.
IE, TNT, it explodes because the reaction propagates faster than the momentum of the reaction gases.
I didn't dig into what is in the mixtures but if there were any Nitrogen  containing items in the mix then he likely made [trichloramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride).
I've made this in the lab before from hypochlorite (household bleach) and ammonia salts in the presence of acid.
The acid drives the hyochlorite to Cl/Cl2 which then reacts with the nitrogen to sequentially create the chloramine species (NH2Cl, NHCl2, and NCl3).
I was only working with probably 100ml of bleach and made 1-3ml of NCl3.
NCl3 is a primary explosive and will detonate violently on shock or heat.
It is also not miscible in water so it aggregates quickly at the base and doesn't take much to make a big boom (don't ask me how I know).
Edit: The NCl3 is denser than water and would collect at the bottom of the bucket creating the pressure needed to cause the explosion/fragmentation of the bucket.
Edit2: I put it in a top level comment but its confirmed here.
https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/9131.
Unless the force was so great the opening on the bucket wasn't enough to disperse the pressure so it went out the sides.
Reactions like that "snowball", or in other words, start slow and then go really fast as more of the 2 kinds of material come into contact with each other.
Just because some gas was escaping doesn't mean some wasn't building pressure.
Take a look at an MSDS for [Dichlor](http://phoenixproductsco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sodium-Dichlor-0030.pdf) as well
&gt; Decomposition  Temperature: Begins to lose 1 mole water at approx.
50°C; second mole water at 95°C: Decomposes at 240-250°
&gt; Hazardous Decomposition Products: Nitrogen trichloride, chlorine, carbon monoxide

3 Gas products.
Looking at 3N in each ring, that sure is looking like an energetic reaction.
Maybe the solution heated fast enough to superheat and decompose the Dichlor?
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
Interesting!
u/kerbaal below mentions that Dichlor itself also readily decompose into NCl3.
According to the [MSDS](http://phoenixproductsco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sodium-Dichlor-0030.pdf).
Could the nitrogen in the air, plus chlorine from hth and the acid from clarity be enough?
[removed]
You don't need a sealed container.
Especially in the above reply mentioning making ncl3.
A primary explosive would do that.
And gun power even in an open container can still blow the container apart.
It's because the explosion moves faster than the air does on top of it.
There for expanding and then breaking the surrounding bucket.
Especially if it was a lot.
N2 wouldnt do it imo.
My best guess is it was from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroisocyanuric_acid in one of the chemicals.
[removed]
[removed]
How about the rapid and localized build up of heat in the bucket causing mechanical expansion in only part of the bucket, putting its structure in increasing tension until failure?
Basically it ripped itself apart.
Every time I encounter NCl3 again and read on it I realize how dumb I was trying to make it to get its spectrum.
This is why they shouldn't let us physical chemists do synthesis....
I'm not 100% sure it was Clarity, or if that's even the correct name, it just stood out in my mind/memory.
I tried searching, but didn't come up with anything, maybe they went out of business?
I have no idea.
What you described seems pretty accurate, so whatever it was, it must have contained dichlor or maybe trichlor.
It was definitely a powdered chlorine-containing pool-cleaning agent :)

I've heard the reaction, in certain  proportions, as "wildly exothermic".
There's three basic outcomes of mixing chlorine with an acid, one is explosive.
[removed]
There is a mystery I can solve for once!
Whatever he did created NCl3... which is a liquid.
The heat boiled some of it, creating a gas that was likely mixed with the chlorine gas, but most of it would sinc to the bottom, being denser than water.
It's pretty volatile stuff, and the water itself would act as the seal.
If enough of this liquid built up at the bottom of the bucket, and then it got set off somehow.
Since it is sensitive to light, heat, and shock, it would be pretty easy for that to happen.

&gt; People forget - dissolving substances in very exothermic.
The majority of dissolution reactions are exothermic, but not all of them.
[Ammonium nitrate](https://sciencing.com/two-examples-endothermic-processes-spontaneous-21061.html) is just one example of an endothermic dissolution.
Another one is acetonitrile in water.
In this class of reactions, the actual delta-H is positive, but because the increase in entropy is so large, the overall Gibb's Free Energy is still negative.
[removed]
Yes, thank you.
Edited original comment.
Ran a  pool store for some time.
This reaction is *exactly* why we tell people not to combine the three primary types of solid chlorinating pool disinfectant.
Somewhere I have a picture of a 4" charred hole in a concrete pool deck (the verge around a typical in-ground pool).
This was a result of some genius mixing powdered MPS, dichlor, trichlor, and calcium hypochlorite.
His excuse was that he wanted the most effective granular shock possible.
I suggested he just add them to the pool next time like the damn instructions suggest.
Edit: another key detail that might help explain the chain of events...

Hydrochloric acid (sold as muriatic acid) was also present.
The man was adjusting his pool pH that day.
It was found to be far too low (5.5), so he possibly used *waaaaay* too much HCL.

This is *very* substance dependent; the opposite is also true.
For example, if you were to dissolve ammonium nitrate in water, the reaction is quite endothermic.

As /u/PixelCortex is a fellow south african, its likely he's thinking of this: http://poolserve.co.za/products/Clarity-Chlorine-2.25kg.html.
I don't know if its only a local brand but it's pretty common here.
Pulling a bigger image from another local store page here https://www.makro.co.za/Images/Products/Large/MIN_10631_EAA.jpg?v=20180828, it shows the active ingredient as Trichloroisocyanuric acid.

First link, that's the one, down to the labling and everything.
My question is, where the hell is the Consumer Products Safety Commission when you need them?
This is apparently a really common situation, and it's super deadly.
One of these two chemicals should be banned, or both need to have gigantic banner warning labels on them telling you not to mix them.
Like, "THIS IS A CLASS A CHLORINE COMPOUND.
DO NOT MIX WITH CLASS B CHLORINE COMPOUNDS."
This kind of fuckup should not be possible in a modern society.

So the government should step in and ban the sale of 1 of 2 kinds of pool cleaners (despite both having different use cases) or require even larger warning labels (that still wouldn't be read) to fix a problem killing, maybe, a handful of people per decade?
Keeping in mind that approx.
the same number of people will be killed or rendered vegetative by brain amoeba from swimming in lakes each decade.
Life is risky, no one gets out alive.
Hopefully OP learned a lesson about reading warning labels on things sold as "Dangerous Chemicals".

It's common enough that retailers of the products need to have specific safety instructions for employees about how and where to stock them.
If you are foolish enough...
Seriously, this could have been very dire.
As in chemical-warfare-combined-with-a-shrapnel-round-dire.
How sensitive is NCl3?
Looking that two dudes blew themselves up during the first synthesis it seems pretty crazy.
Make it in an ice bath or something to try and keep it calm?
I can only speak anecdotally here.
When I made it, I added ammonium chloride to bleach in a round bottom flask then added a few ml of HCl.
Quickly topped with a condenser to cool any escaping NClx back into to solution and let it stir in an ice bath for a while until the solution stop being cloudy.
The output went to a water bubbler to trap the Cl2.
I was able to pipette the NCl3 out with a glass pipet into a glass vial covered in foil without issue.
It sat out for about a day that way at room temp.
Later I went to transfer some via syringe to measure it and that's where I hit the problem.
I tested it wouldn't react to the rubber (its highly oxidizing) and I tested it wouldn't react with the metal in the syringe.
However when I pierced a septum to inject the sample, the needle cored the septum blocking the syringe exit.
The simple act of pressing on the plastic syringe with tip blocked detonated the sample in my hand.
Luckily it was only about 50 microliters.
The rest of the sample we just threw on a paper towel and burned for disposal.
The towel just burned like it had some alcohol on it.
tl;dr its pretty darn sensitive.
Just leaving it in light, dropping it or putting some pressure on it makes it explode.
Fire is apparently ok.

Epsom salts in water is a fun one for kids to experience.
Pour some epsom salts in their hands and add some water, their hands get chilly.

The explosin could have occured simply from the pressure caused by the violent release of large amounts of gases from mixing two chemicals.
I never found "not enough people died from this for us to consider doing anything about it" to be a very convincing argumetn.
Explosives explode even if they are just sitting out in the open.
Chlorine reacts rapidly in certain situations, one of which the OP seems to have created - so just sitting in a bucket with an open top wouldn't prevent it.
It's possible he mixed them in just the right amounts for such an explosive reaction, and that you and I might not be able to replicate the reaction.
It's also possible that the older chemicals had decomposed or reacted with air or other things in the environment to make new chemicals and that the new chemicals helped set off the reaction.
But all of these things can happen and have happened, but its usually pretty hard to figure out exactly *what* happened.
So the general rule is *do not mix chemicals,* unless you are absolutely sure you know what chemicals you're mixing and what they are made from, and you know what will happen when you mix them and are trying to achieve that result.
I don't see how what u/agate_ said was unreasonable or unnecessary intervention by the government.
If you're not a chemist and you go to a pool shop to buy "chlorine", it's completely within reason to expect that these different "chlorine" products are equivalent and would pose no hazard upon mixing.
Judging by other comments in this thread, it seems to be more common than you'd expect.
I think a large label saying do not mix class A with class B type warning is a great idea.
There's a difference between typically encountered "dangerous chemicals" (bleach, drain cleaner, HCl, solvents etc.)
and ones that to the layperson appear to be the same thing yet when mixed result in the formation of an impact, light, and temperature sensitive primary explosive.

They actually do say exactly that right on the sides of chlorines.
The brand I buy has a huge warning on the side AND a sticker on the top.
I know because when I did the exact same thing as the OP (like a complete moron) I thought the same thing, then went to check the container out, and lo and behold it was marked all over.
Sometimes you just can't stop stupidity no matter how hard you try.

Someone should probably be researching this at the very least.
It seems like we have a good idea of what happened from the discussion in this thread, but as with all science we could be totally off the mark and when it comes to explosions it's important to understand why exactly they happened so they don't happen again.
This is something that seems like a very easy mistake to make, and if we don't change something it will almost definitely happen again.
Found it.

You've got it.
I made this mistake once by mixing the chlorine and acid in the bucket together instead of separately.
Massive overflowing cloud of green gas came flowing out and then it started violently boiling over and sloshing.
Never exploded but I bet it could have been nasty if there wasn't water in the bucket.
The cloud dispersed eventually and the bucket calmed down.
It was warm to the touch.
Now I'm careful to mix everything separately.
Everything you’ve mentioned seems inorganic but organic peroxide’s can be explosive... is it possible an organic peroxide was created?
Hypochlorites do react violently with trichlor or dichlor.
I don't think we're dealing with an 'explosion' here.
It's just a very vigorous reaction.
An analogue would be throwing a lump of alkali metal into water - there's no explosion per say but a very loud and vigorous reaction.

So does that mean if you take HTH and mix it with boric acid it would produce chlorine gas?

[deleted]
No further research is needed.
These reactions are understood very thoroughly, and every single bottle of powdered or compressed tablet chlorine will tell you to never, ever mix them.
On top of which, common sense should tell you not to mix chlorine products with ANYTHING.
[removed]
I work in a field closely related to drinking water treatment.
This sounds like a reaction we work with fairly frequently called quenching since Sodium Hypochlorite is one of the main treatment chemicals.
Calcium Hypochlorite reacts similarly, but for reasons that are beyond the scope of this course you don't need to worry about quenching Calcium Hypochlorite.
The point of this reaction is to get the chlorine out of the solution to stop the decay of the Hypochlorite and see what's left over.
If what u/Appaulingly says is true and the Clarity has Peroxide in it, then OP likely quenched the calcium or sodium hypochlorite, whichever it actually was.
You can also quench sodium hypochlorite with acids though, so any of those theories as to what's in the Clarity will provide the same reaction.
The quenching reaction is typically violent and it releases pure chlorine gas, which is poisonous.
When you quench, you typically add the quenching agent drop by drop to the Hypochlorite and do it under a fume hood so you don't poison everyone or make the beaker explode.
It sounds like whatever was in that Clarity basically quenched the whole bucket at once, which created a ton of chlorine gas and nuked the bucket.
And that's the bell!
Everyone remember to drop your homework in the box on the way out and remember the quiz on Friday!
It's endothermic, but nowhere near the same order of magnitude as some of the exothermic ones.
Update: I see below that someone found the Clarity actually contains Trichloroisocnanuric Acid, which confirms my theories above that there was major quenchin' goin' on.
These reactions are thoroughly understood, but the circumstances in which they took place are not.
Strictly speaking this would be public safety research, not chemistry research.
And yes indeed almost all cleaning compounds with have a giant warning label not to mix them with other cleaning compounds, but the average person probably doesn't understand that two similar products by different brands are actually different chemical compounds.
In theory additional research shouldn't be necessary, but we now have empirical evidence that it might be.
I understand your viewpoint, but i don't see the engame of the research.
What can we do besides putting large warning labels on canisters of chlorine?
Should procurement be limited?
What do you see the possible outcome of this research being?
Your comment made me remember that I had a rag soaked in a stout calcium hypochlorite solution catch fire.
Was disinfecting a well pump line which had some oxidized iron on it.
Was a really hot day, 34°C or something and I thought the pipe was just warm.
Nope, the rag was starting to smoulder.
I absolutely hate the way chlorine compounds are talked about.
It's so confusing.
No one reads the labels to find what the hell he's actually working with.
Hypochlorite --&gt; chlorine
Thrichloroisocyanuric acid --&gt; also chlorine
Hydrochloric acid --&gt; chlorine
Actual Cl2 --&gt; mustard gas
Chloramine --&gt; also mustard gas.
I mean, ammonia and bleach are both sold as general purpose household cleaners, both sold as toilet bowl cleaners etc.
So it's not a surprise that other household chemicals that would be dangerous if mixed are sold.
The public safety is you are responsible for reading the warning labels.
Those labels tell you what to and not to do and they already tell you not to do what he did.
The research you are looking for has been done and they warned you about it already...
Not only exothermic, but oxidizing.
Maybe the plastic bucket became a fuel in a runaway reaction?
People actually use the MSDS?
[removed]
It's almost as if we shouldn't be selling 2 different types of pool chlorine that can chemically react with each other.
[removed]
[removed]
That's not how public safety research works.
As an individual, you are responsible for keeping yourself safe.
The responsibility of the entity in charge of product safety however, is to reduce the overall risk of injury/death to zero.
Obviously that's impossible, but it's still the goal.
This research isn't "done," that's not how research works either.
We are currently in a thread that provides evidence that this research is not done, and unless OP is lying, which I don't think is a reasonable assumption, then it is complete proof that this research *isn't* done.
Edit: [Here](https://www.chemaxx.com/images/walmart29a-Blue-Green.jpg) is a side-by-side photo of the labels, taken from [this](https://www.chemaxx.com/pool_chemical_explosion5.htm) website posted elsewhere in this thread.
Also from that website:

&gt;Since both products are sold as a form of "pool chlorine," consumers most likely would not expect them to be incompatible with each other and might even consider them to be the same pool chemical product.
&gt;Consumers need to be aware that these seemingly similar pool chemical products are explosively incompatible.
Chemaxx believes that short of drastic measures, the ordinary consumer is not likely to appreciate the full seriousness of the hazard via conventional warnings.
This is a semantic difference, but I feel like the answer is more along the lines of : Two compounds that explode when mixed should be distinctly labeled enough that they can't be confused with each other.
I  bet you're fun at parties.
Got any others I can teach my 7th grader?

Former pool store employee here: we do!
All employees are trained on not storing different types of chlorine (or any sanitizer) next to one another, and to make sure to tell customers not to mix it when buying.
With cal hypo and tri-chlor (among others), we also would tell customers not to mix either one in a bucket first, due to the heat caused by the reaction with water.
This was basic training before any employee was allowed to talk to customers.
Cal hypo specifically we were told was very dangerous to mix or spill, and to store it at least five feet from any other sanitizer.
[removed]
Don't mix two different types of chlorine together.
Safety instructions complete.
Go check your local pool store.
All the acid and the different types of chlorine will be stored in separate areas.
Calcium hypochlorite isn't transported in standard cardboard boxes because of this.
Yes it can cause an explosion.
I had a pool customer who added two different kinds of pool shock to a bucket of water and it blew up before he could stir it.
He was standing feet from it when it rocked the neighborhood.
He didn't get any bucket shrapnel in him.
But his ears rang for hours in the least.

This stuff shouldn't be experimented with by anybody that doesn't have huge blast proof fume hoods and the right kind of respirators.
It could kill, blind, or poison people.

You can use like with like, but never mix colors/categories.

How does 1 person write all that nonsense without reading a single word I wrote????
The manufacturer (for that matter the entire world since these reactions have been known about for decades and studied in depth already by scientists around the world) already did the research and posted warnings on the containers tell you not to mix those products.
And linking partial pics instead of the full label is just trashy of you.

Mixing the acid pool disinfectant with the calcium hypochlorite produced green chlorine gas, which you observed, and a lot of heat.
It's possible he mixed them in just the right amounts for such an explosive reaction, and that you and I might not be able to replicate the reaction.
The quenching reaction is typically violent and it releases pure chlorine gas, which is poisonous.
No further research is needed.
The towel just burned like it had some alcohol on it.
Ran a  pool store for some time.
It's because the explosion moves faster than the air does on top of it.
On top of which, common sense should tell you not to mix chlorine products with ANYTHING.
It's almost as if we shouldn't be selling 2 different types of pool chlorine that can chemically react with each other.
So does that mean if you take HTH and mix it with boric acid it would produce chlorine gas?
All the acid and the different types of chlorine will be stored in separate areas.
It was warm to the touch.
DO NOT MIX HYPOCHLORITE AND TRICHLOR/DICHLOR.
&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 2: Clarity is most likely trichlor or dichlor which produces chlorine gas and a lot of heat when mixed with hypochlorites.
You can use like with like, but never mix colors/categories.
So it's not a surprise that other household chemicals that would be dangerous if mixed are sold.
There are a number of chemical reactions that create explosive energy release with zero containment.
Could the nitrogen in the air, plus chlorine from hth and the acid from clarity be enough?
I didn't dig into what is in the mixtures but if there were any Nitrogen  containing items in the mix then he likely made [trichloramine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride).
That's not how public safety research works.
DO NOT MIX WITH CLASS B CHLORINE COMPOUNDS."
The public safety is you are responsible for reading the warning labels.
It could kill, blind, or poison people.
I was only working with probably 100ml of bleach and made 1-3ml of NCl3.
Go check your local pool store.
NCl3 is a primary explosive and will detonate violently on shock or heat.
thats what confuses me about this too.
It's pretty volatile stuff, and the water itself would act as the seal.
According to the MSDS of [HTH](http://fileserve.newporthigh.co.uk/Manuals/Volume%207%20of%208/Buckingham%20Pools/16.%20HtH%20Calcium%20Hypochlorite%20tablets.pdf), the source of chlorine for the disinfectant is calcium hypochlorite.
One of these two chemicals should be banned, or both need to have gigantic banner warning labels on them telling you not to mix them.
I noticed vapor coming off the mixture almost immediately as I started mixing.
He didn't get any bucket shrapnel in him.
Edit2: I put it in a top level comment but its confirmed here.
Peroxides also react with hypochlorites to generate heat but oxygen gas instead.
What do you see the possible outcome of this research being?
