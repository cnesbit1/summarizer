Zeraora and Lugia ends tmr and why is there no announcement for the next event for japan?!?!?!?
Don't tell me they are the last japanese event for 7th gen &gt;_&lt;

We didn't have enough events, USUM launched only 10 months ago and this year some annual events weren't held.
and I need bday event on december.
I think, or hope, there will be more.
We'll have to see of they start doing events for Lets Go.
Fingers crossed US gets another year of events before the launch of gen 8.
ORAS had 59 event pokemons in total ON GEN 6 LAST YEAR and USUM has 28 (2 being gaore Pika/Magiarna) for the first 10 months?!?!?
And farming is hassle in gen 7, I feel the gen 7 hate for event collectors.
I honestly believe the super long intro was made specifically to deter event farming.
Jokes on them, I have no life!
:/
It couldn't keep me from event farming.
it's just a dumb idea stealing hours from event collectors :(
This ha!
We got no lives anyway, suck it we win anyway xD.
Kinda feel like there should be another wave of mythical events for NA &amp; PAL, it would be weird that 2 of the largest region don't have access to alolan mark mythical.
And there are still list of mythical not yet released this gen: Deoxys, Keldeo, Genesect, Diancie(pls gib), Volcanion.
Game Freak sure does have a weird way of distributing events.
Before the 20th anniversary event, there wasn't a Mew event for almost 6 years.
They've completely skipped Mew for gen 5 and we didn't get that Mew event until towards the end of gen 6.
I could see us going without them.
Gamefreak doesn't seem to mind skipping mythical Pokemon for long periods of time.
If anything, I think farming is even MORE prevalent?
?
