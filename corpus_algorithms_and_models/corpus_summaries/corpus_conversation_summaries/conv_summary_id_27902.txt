Bannable offense.
So I'm not allowed to resubmit?
I'm confused.
Feel free to resubmit.
Don't delete your submissions when they're removed.
It's spammer behavior and bannable.
The app doesn't let me send the same link to the same sub, so that's the only way I know how to resubmit.
I have been doing it for 2 yrs, and this is the 1st I've heard of it.
Sorry.
You can re-upload the photo to imgur and it will provide you with a new link.
Ok.
I have always just shared direct from my gallery on my phone.
I will try it.
