Original Response: 
It's been a rough journey for the both of us to get to this point, but I'm glad we did.
I wasn't the most accepting of the idea of him being gay for the longest time, and while I changed my mind quickly, I'm very thankful I didn't irreparably harm our relationship before I did.
Anyway, my son has a boyfriend (James) and apparently they've been dating since March, though I only discovered this last month.
Regardless, I happen to know James well, and he's a very nice boy.
I never would have suspected either of them were gay though.
Both do sports, (James is on the football team), and neither is feminine at all.
Which I guess goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover.
Anyway, my son told me that they're both "out" to their high school now, and have been since the start of the school year (they're juniors).
I'm was (and still am) a little worried about bullying or intolerance, but we live in a fairly liberal and a quite large city, and I am lucky enough to have a great job that I love that allows us to live in an affluent area with great schools, and they don't tolerate bullying for any reason.
While I know some in this community will disagree with the direction I have taken this, I hope you can understand that it was either I accept him for him, or I hurt him deeply and lose him once he leaves for college in a few years.
And I've come to realize that God, righteous as He is, surely would not punish my son for something beyond his control.

&gt; And I've come to realize that God, righteous as He is, surely would not punish my son for something beyond his control.
The bible is clear when it comes to unrepeantance.
One ought not be repentant for their actions if those actions were not sins.
Th bible is clear on homosexuality in thought and deed being sinful.
You can repent for unconfessed sins and the Holy Spirit is within you to help convict you.
Also you can educate your children of what is and isn't a sin.

&gt;My daughter was mad at me for a few days because she had to come to terms that her best friend who committed suicide last year is most probably burning in Hell.
Yikes.

So it's better to make your children outcast and withhold your support and love undoubtedly causing irreparable damage to the relationship just because you have a differing of opinion on what one's sexual orientation *aught* to be even though that is beyond anyone's control?
[removed]
Surely it is better to teach your child the truth, instead of making them feel better about their sinful choices ?
[removed]
There are ways of teaching things that don't involve making them feel alone, desperate, self-loathing, and unloved.
If you want to speak about truth then the truth is one's sexual orientation is not a choice.
Do you have kids?
&gt;There are ways of teaching things that don't involve making them feel alone, desperate, self-loathing, and unloved

The truth always sets people free, and you don't have to tell them in a mean way.
&gt; truth is one's sexual orientation is not a choice.
No the truth -&gt; the truth is we have a choice on how we deal with temptation.
&gt;Do you have kids?
Yes.

Exactly this!
My best friend growing up has fallen into sin and her family has basically disowned her.
I'm one of the only Christian influences she has left in her life.
She's fully aware of my beliefs because she once shared them.
But, instead of abandoning her and telling her that I can't associate because she's turned into some sort of "abomination" (her parents' words, not mine), I continue to love her and be kind to her.
She respects that, which is why we're still friends.
She will likely never have a relationship with her parents or extended family ever again.
Why would I want to cut off one of the last lifelines to Christ that she has?
[removed]
Is having the thoughts once enough to go to hell?
Love is not a sin.
Surely it's better that kids dont commit suicide?
[removed]
That old strawman.
&gt; The truth always sets people free

Yet so many are resistant to it.
Some people cant handle it.
&gt; the truth is we have a choice on how we deal with temptation

Could you chose to not be attracted to members of your opposite sex?
Could you chose to not be aroused by whatever fetish or turn on you have?
So you would abandon your kids and damage your relationship with them permanently just so you could feel superior?
You would isolate them and make them feel like they were a mistake and damaged beyond repair because you have a difference of opinion on an ideology?
[removed]
Hugs for your friend - I too have no ties with every member of my family save a sibling, most people dont understand what that is like and tends to be very judgemental and resort to victim blaming.
Im glad you are choosing to be supportive and respecting of your friend.
Even if part of it is to share your belief you still are doing an honorable and human thing of being there for someone you care for.
Its a shame there arent more people like you.
&gt; So you would abandon your kids and damage your relationship with them permanently just so you could feel superior?
You would isolate them and make them feel like they were a mistake and damaged beyond repair because you have a difference of opinion on an ideology?
Of course not - but I would still tell them the truth.
Homosexuality is sinful.
&gt; I would still tell them the truth

Even if like OP said you would destroy their relationship and life?
Risk never seeing them again and causing damage far reaching beyond anything you could imagine?
There is a quote that fits here: "In the eyes of a child, mother is god."
How would you feel if your parent or god looked upon you with disdain and disgust?
That you were an abomination and a mistake to them?
You didnt answer my other question.
Can you choose to turn off your attraction to what you are attracted to?
Force yourself to shift those feelings and desires to that opposite of what they currently are?
How would you react if your kid came out as gay?
Excuse me?

It isn't really a strawman.
Outcomes for LGBT children are much worse when they aren't able to express their identity and don't have strong support systems.
&gt; My daughter was mad at me for a few days because she had to come to terms that her best friend who committed suicide last year is most probably burning in Hell.
I can tell you that there's a good chance she will hold this against you for a long time.
It is not appropriate to tell a grieving child that their best friend is in hell.

It's not the holy quatrinity.
The Bible has never beer a part of god and I'm not entirely sure why so many people act like it is.
I truly believe no one is going to hell for cloudy parts of the Bibles teachings because it's basically flipping a coin and you either go to hell or you don't.
God is going to be just in his decision and hes going to judge you for who you are, not what side of the coin you landed on.
Which means you need to make the decision.
It's just a part of life.
It wouldn't be much of a life if we didn't make our own decisions.

&gt; unless God has mercy on mental illness

I would be skeptical of anyone who tried to tell you otherwise.
We know that mental illnesses physically change and damage the brain.
People suffering from mental illness are not always in full control of their actions.
Culturally, we have this attitude that it's "just in their head", and while it is true that it is literally in their head, we seem to forget that what's in our head is what shapes every aspect of our conscious experience.
Destructive behaviors exhibited by those suffering from mental illness are pathological.
Some lash out at others and some at themselves.
While we expect people suffering from mental illness to take responsibility for their actions insofar as they harm others, it is wise to be compassionate and understand that their illness has physically changed their brain in ways that makes their behavior very difficult (or seemingly impossible) to control.
&gt; Outcomes for LGBT children are much worse when they aren't able to express their identity and don't have strong support systems.
Tell them the truth, support them, don't deny them the ability to get counseling when they need help.
[removed]
I would tell them I loved them and at the same time tell them the truth.
Offer them help.
_if_ the didn't want help and wanted to embrace sin, I would say fine, just not under my roof.
&gt; .
Can you choose to turn off your attraction to what you are attracted to?
No, because everyone is born straight, it in the genes.
Telling teens that homosexuality is a sin causes them to kill themselves.
Whereas telling teens that the can't change, they have to embrace homosexuality and denying them access to help, doesn't cause suicide.
&gt; Tell them the truth

The thing is, they know.
They know what you consider to be the truth.
Any LGBT person living in a predominantly Christian area already hears this stuff on a regular basis.
They don't need yet another person reminding them, they need support.
Well that’s wrong, where are you getting your science from?
If you can’t change your sexual orientation then why the hell would you expect someone else to be able to?

I don't have to, those who choose sinful lifestyles need to repent if they want to have a relationship with God.
I have educated him.
He knows right from wrong.
He's a good person.
He's nice to people, gets good grades, is liked by his peers and was chosen as junior captain of the swim team.
He doesn't smoke or drink, and he's always respectful.
Oh, okay, so telling bullied teens that there's nothing wrong with them is *forcing them to embrace homosexuality*... and not forcing them into shock therapy is *denying access to help.
*

Jesus Christ.
As a lawyer, I must say that the laws in this country regarding addiction, especially in GOP controlled states, are draconianly harsh.
No one talked about shock therepy.
I didn't say it was.
Homosexuality is a sin.

I disagree.

You'd be wrong to do so.
The scriptures are clear on the subject.

Matthew 5:28.
Then you disagree with the Bible.
Then so be it.
Kicking your gay children out - just as Jesus!
Did I say that?
Though it is not your domain to dictate whether or not my beliefs contradict the Bible.
Wars have been fought over this issue, far be it from you to claim the mandate of interpreter.

Wars have not been fought over homosexuality.
I don't understand how you can be complicity in your disagreement with the Bible, you defend it as "just my interpretation" when it is stated in both Leviticus and Romans explicitly condemning homosexual relations.
The Old Testament isn't exactly the most up to date thing around is it?
Interpretation ought to change over time.
It contains such nuggets as:

- Ephesians 5:22, "Wives, submit to you husbands as to the Lord"; and similar advice for slaves in 1 Peter 2:18: "Slaves, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the cruel."
- Timothy 2:12: “I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.”

- Leviticus 18:19 "Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity."
dude you sound so fucking whack and you are the REASON why our youth and next generation is straying away from christianity .
whatever happened to ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE!!!!!!!!????????
PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH.
that’s wrong cause i was born gay as fuck , before i even knew what gay was.
No, it doesn't, and I think your comment is sloppy.
Beyond this point you're making unrelated criticisms that don't pertain to the comment, so I'm removing the chain.
I'm removing this for 2.2 and I'll remove the rest of the chain as well.
[deleted]
Romans, Peter, Timothy and Ephesians aren't from the Old Testament, neither is Romans, that is not a valid argument, disagreeing with the Bible isn't right just because you don't like it.
I will stick to traditional interpretation from priestly authority thank you.
Yes.
That kind of behaviour creates lifelong trauma.
It horrifies me that any parent would treat their child, and their child's grief, so poorly.
If that's the part of my argument you've taken issue with, as opposed to the the actual content, then clearly you are so deeply ingrained in your views you cannot ever be persuaded.
You are not a Christian if you deny the authority of the Bible, plain and simple, if you would rather cherry-pick and interpret what makes you feel nice and fit the message you *think* Jesus preached then you aren't following Christianity, but your own religion based on Christianity.
Let me ask you this: do you believe that a woman should be able to teach a man?
Or ever, in any circumstance, have authority over him?
If you say yes, then your beliefs contradict the Bible.
If you say no, your views are not fit for modern society.
I do not believe women have authority over men or should teach men in matters of the Church ever, I have no interest in modern society, modernity isn't virtue.

What else do you understand by "just not under my roof"?
Okay, now you're just lying, and that's a sin too.
Provide citation for this asinine claim.
I don't think you understand what sexuality means, gender has nothing to do with it.
No, they do **in your opinion**.
The fact that this debate even exists is evidence that scripture is not clear.

You call truth a strawman?
[You do realize that the **only** reason that homosexuals have higher suicide rate (in countries where being gay isn't a crime) is because of religious homophobia, right?
](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-lgbq-religion-suicide/religious-faith-linked-to-suicidal-behavior-in-lgbq-adults-idUSKBN1HK2MA)
That's straight up child abuse, isn't it?
Are you going to explain your point?
Contrary to popular belief, people on /r/christianity have heard of the Bible.
Quoting verses for no reason doesn't explain anything, you need to tell us what you mean by that.
Just the fact that you would treat the person you are supposed to love the most like this tells a lot about your life anywhere else, just hitting her with enormous trauma for no reason, I can't even imagine what kind of things you do to others, and you are surprised they don't treat you well?
If you're surrounded by assholes, maybe you're the asshole.
Even Maria Theresa or Mary herself could not teach men a thing or two?
Mary is literally the mother of God and Maria Theresa isn't a saint in Orthodox Christianity.

What about this long list of women saints?
orthodoxchristiantheology.com/2014/07/14/1-tim-214-15-a-simple-interpretation
Read this, it isn't like women's opinions are disregarded but they don't have authority over men.
I simply disagree.
There are times when a women's authority ought to eclipse that of men, be it a church setting or otherwise.
OK but I'm just saying what my opinion is, which is the Orthodox stance of the Bible, brining up your opinion or women saints doesn't change anything.
Telling the truth?
Of course not.

I had a very close friend of mine who had passed away in an accident about 15 years years ago.
Shortly after it had happened, I was at my in laws and I was still pretty upset.
My father in law decided to lecture me and tell me he was in hell as my friend wasn't a practicing Christian.
I had the good sense to get up and state I'm leaving and going home.
My father in law chased me to my car, all the way insisting that he was right.
Fifteen years later I remember that conversation like it happened yesterday.
&gt; if the didn't want help and wanted to embrace sin, I would say fine, just not under my roof.
This is the correct solution in this case.
If they want to live homosexually, which is a sin, they can do so after they have moved out.
And if they do so anyway?
No.
Homosexuality is a sin.
But what if, while under your roof, they have a secret same sex relationship at school that you find out about?
That would be an embarrassment, and a sin.
Well at least you wouldn't do something awful like lock him in his room.

I always find it fascinating how *so many* people can claim to be part of the same religion and yet have so little in common with each others beliefs.
&gt; No, because everyone is born straight, it in the genes.
Thanks for the science lesson Trump.
&gt; Did I say that?
yes

do...do you *read* what you write?
But that's not truth, that's an opinion.
Ultimately it's up to God who goes to hell or not, and we don't know his will.
It was an opinion he terrorized his daughter with, that's child abuse.
Well, yeah.
Teaching people that homosexuality is wrong and that they need to change results in **far** higher suicide rates than teaching them to embrace and be confident in who they are.
Yes, people jump to conclusions 

I wouldn't throw my kid put, they just would be able to promote homosexuality of bring their partners into my house.

&gt;The fact that this debate even exists is evidence that scripture is not clear.
It is clear, it's just homosexuals and their  allies try to justify sin.
If that makes you feel better.
This does not happen when people stick to the established tradition.
It's also pretty clear about judging people is it not?
Oh wait.
I forgot.
Confirmation and selection bias.
You literally can't tell how illogical your stance is.
Shame.
Ah yes, the old testament.
I trust you are wearing only a single type of fiber?
You know what, don't even worry yourself.
Rule only apply when you decide they're relevant, after all.
For someone who claims to want to save souls, you are really good at doing not that.

I love how guys like you bring up established tradition as if Christians in the past weren't every bit as wrong as you are now!
So God led the church astray?
Also objectively you all contradict the Bible.
&gt; So God led the church astray?
Eh, I'd say it's probably more *people* that led the Church astray but the point still stands.
I'm just saying Churches in the past have supported slavery, supported tyranny, etc.
&gt; Also objectively you all contradict the Bible.
I don't see how.
All I've said on the matter is that Christians in the past were wrong.
I mean, I don't necessarily believe in the idea of biblical inerrancy, but that's besides the point.
Well we fundamentally disagree.
Hah.
Pay that.
I'm not wrong.
Would you prefer I lie to you?
&gt;It's also pretty clear about judging people is it not?
It is, but then what would you know?
An atheist trying to tell me what the bible means.
&gt; I always find it fascinating how so many people can claim to be part of the same religion and yet have so little in common with each others beliefs.
There can be a logical conclusion on some core doctrines reached through debate.
&gt; Well we fundamentally disagree.
Truly a masterful rebuttal.
But, if, say they had same sex partner in highschool, and kept it out of the house, you'd just turn a blind eye?
Would you let them stay over their partners house (assuming they were stupid enough to tell you who they were)?
This is just sheer curiosity at this point.
&gt;What would you know

Apparently, exactly what I claim to.
My point is that, statistically, stances like this lead to more people leaving religion than coming to religion.
Not everyone takes God up on his offer of salavation.
Okay?
Does this relate to our discussion?
