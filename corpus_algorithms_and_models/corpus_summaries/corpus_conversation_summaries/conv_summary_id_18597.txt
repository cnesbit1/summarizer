Jesus, just stop it.Being that beautiful without even trying just shouldn't be allowed.
She's beautiful.
Without trying?
Funny.

Not at all close to "without even trying."
Ahh I see, well this is new information, though it seems to me that she is this beautiful without even trying on as well as off set.
It takes a ton of work to appear to be beautiful without even trying.
Stop posting m'ladys photos in this sub!
She is a feminist and would not approve!
Those legs are perfect.

Summary: 
She's on a movie set here.
