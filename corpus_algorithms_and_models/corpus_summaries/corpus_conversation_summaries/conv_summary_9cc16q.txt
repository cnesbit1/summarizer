Thatâ€™s some fifty shades shit.
Never read it.
Itâ€™s a book where the girls a journalist, they meet when she interviews him, they fall in love, he turns out to be a BDSM fanatic.
Never read it either but itâ€™s everywhere these days.
I would argue that itâ€™s not some 50 shades shit because:

* OP wasnâ€™t stalked or controlled.
There was consent and She felt safe.
* Her writing is a thousand times better than 50 shades.
Dear lord.
I expect my life to be less spectacular.
It sounds a bit like a cheesy Virginia Andrews young adult novel rip off.
Thank you my dear!
We filmed the whole session so I am pretty sure it didn't happen in my imaginationðŸ˜Š.
I agree 100% ðŸ˜‚.
Just saying there are similarities.
Hahaha this comment should be the top review for that book.

Alright, alright people.
I was just noting the similarities between the journalist meeting the BDSM fanatic.
Didnâ€™t think everyone would take me so literally because I know and I get it.
Have a nice day.
