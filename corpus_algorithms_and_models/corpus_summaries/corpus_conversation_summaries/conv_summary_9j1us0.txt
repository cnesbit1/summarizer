Humans and chimps mate all the year round so there’s not really a season where it is favourable for mating.
If there was a particular bad time of year for babies to be born i.e.
depths of winter in the arctic circle then it would be common sense make things easier by not mating 9 months earlier but this is a conscious decision and not a biologically driven.
Anyone who has tried for a baby knows there’s a few days every month when the chances are highest when the woman is in oestrus which is probably the closest thing to a mating time.

Indeed, if you look at graphs that show frequency of births by day the highest frequency is usually June-October, 9 months after the winter months for the northern hemisphere.
Shouldn't that study just split by hemisphere for potentially better results about how string seasonal factors could be?

Well there’s also holidays and such.
Sex is free and around the holidays you might not have as much cash.

Also it's cold out and you're stuck inside all day looking for indoor activities.
Yeah but then you have the Southern Hemisphere so I’m wondering if it’s different there.
I would assume it's flipped, but the preponderance of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere.
I was trying to stay that there are non weather related factors that might contribute.
