Anyone have medium to large boxes for moving?
I'm trying to leave by 6-5.
Sorry for the rush but anything helps.
Thank you!
I got some last month from the liquor store.
The one at the corner of Nile and McArdle.
They had a lot of boxes and said anytime I need them to just go and get them.
I'm sure they'd do the same for you.
Can't say they had any large ones though.
ask on that facebook group trash to treasures if anyone has any large boxes.
If you cant find any free, Walmart sells them near the office supply section.

Lowes has more sizes, handles, stronger and cheaper.
I spent about $7 on boxes to move and got about 10-15 boxes.
Walmart was like $1.20 each, lowes was like $0.69.
If you go to the parking lot between Water Street Oyster Bar and Coffee Waves downtown, there is a cardboard dumpster, you might could pull some out of that.
