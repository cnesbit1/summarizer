Original Response: 
A couple of choice quotes, if I may:

&gt;	But what it reveals in stark detail is the fawning, gnawing social envy among these rightwing people, who consistently saturate themselves in the iconography of rebellion that no part of their sad addiction to conformity and authority in any way resembles.
&gt;[…]

&gt;	The right aren’t rebels, they’re apologists for privilege, a quality that eternally defines them.
&gt;	Real rebels, of course, face down threats, having reckoned in advance there will be a cost to their refusals.
Basically, these right-wing blowhards suck the dicks of their betters and expect to be seen as rebels, instead of the servile losers that they are.
You've touched on a key word here.
Betters.
They believe that there are "Betters", people who deserve respect whether for being in control, for their wealth or for their birth.
The idea that they are equals to the rest is a challenge for them.
Conservatism is the new punk rock.
Also, we love cops and doing what we are told by our betters.
But we will not be lectured or bossed around by poor people, black people, women, gays, ((cultural Marxists)), or environmentalists!
People are fucking twisted.
Between this and the Naitanui kid I've lost faith in most supposed Australian adults on either side of the spectrum.
We've ruined a couple of generations with this toxic identity politics shit of both stripes.
Edit: Downvote away, hypocrites.
A lynch mob for a kid whose parents don't like the anthem is substantively no different to a lynch mob for a kid who's mum blacked him up for Book Week.
Both are fucking despicable and self-reflection is not a bad thing, no matter what footy team you back.
 **Trump**: Well, I do think there's blame- Yes.
I do think  there's blame on both sides.
You look at both sides.
I think there's  blame on both sides and I have no doubt about it and you don't have any  doubt about it either and- and- and- and if you reported it accurately,  you would say it.
Lacks impact when you're making a 1:1 comparison.
Reaching, Hansonite shit.
Back to your cave, Katter.

How do they do that?
How about you argue the point instead of just calling him a Donald Trump supporter?

Wow, that's one hell of a false equivalence there!
Explain how.
It's alright when you do it but not when the other side does?
Is that the size of it?
Kids can be guilty of killing your sacred cows but not others?
I'm not following your equivocating.
How do they do what?
Which, by the way, a short stroll through my comment history should debunk.
I am simultaneously a bleeding heart commie and a Nazi shitlord apparently.
I reckon I must have the balance right.
I'm not arguing I just want to know why you say that?
Disliking the anthem and getting blacked up aren’t equal.
You know this.

Let's let the absolute class act that is Nic Naitanui explain why you need to pull your head in.
It's a kid.
I don't give a crap what equivocating you do, if you ever rationalise vilifying a kid who hasn't even hit puberty yet you are every bit as bad as the Hansonite scum.
What a load of hypocritical crap.
Nice false equivalence.
You are behaving exactly as Hanson and Latham and the other fascist snowflakes.
Comparing the quality or lack thereof of their reasoning to Donald Trumps doesn't mean that they're calling them a Donald Trump supporter.
They are arguing the point, they're pointing out that both 'CaptainExtravaganza' &amp; Donald Trump make sloppy arguments of [false equivalence](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcR5gQTuwOy55DESOBKG5e6MoMkVNkg5-gNHtQVY5aafa3ZIYJ1s).
Says the trash justifying attacking children who accidentally offend your political views.
Go home, Hansonite.
You're just as bad as any trumpscum.
Yeah no.
It's a cop out of an answer that paints his opponent in a bad light in order to avoid responding to the points made.
I believe the argument would be that one is standing up for minorities, while the other is denigrating them.
all i said is that they're not equal - i've made no statements past that.
[removed]
You may, shit explosion.
[removed]
So why bother pointing it out?
The point is there is no justification for vilifying children for thoughtcrime so why equivocate unless you think it's ok in some situations?
[removed]
Pick any of their policies/talking points and it is always about them deserving more than the rest of the world.
We have our pitchforks and tiki torches ready, our moral outrage is fully charged and ready to go, just point us at the outsider and we'll do the rest.
Welcome to Australian polity, where the outrage is made up and facts don't matter.
thoughtcrime?
what?
My positions: 

Blackface is obviously derogatory - the kid's not to blame, however.
It's a kid.
Criticising our shitty anthem - good.
Kid is at zero fault and shouldn't be attacked at all.
Comparing the two is not equal however.
Blackface is viewed as derogatory to minorities and criticising the anthem is derogatory to nationalistic dickheads.
They're not equal victims and it's not an equal act.
They're both getting a lot of attention, at similar times, but there's no way either kid deserves any harassment or bullying.
It's not about identity politics (also known as All Politics) it's about reacting in a reasonable way.
So you're going to respond to someone highlighting the structure of a counterargument employed against you by a third person by making a completely erroneous statement about what they've said.
Go troll somewhere else.
This is radical centrism.
Such a cop out of an answer that you couldn't even provide a rebuttal that dealt with the differences or similarites between the cases of the two children that 'CaptainExtravaganza' first mentioned.
Says the debating club president who presents insults in lieu of arguments.
Then you're justified in attacking child.
Congratulations.
You're officially in the same column as Hanson and Trump.
Or, you agree with me completely.
Which is it?
Conservatism is the fear that somewhere, someone you consider your inferior is being treated as your equal.
"I deserve this (comfort, safety, freedom, the right to marry the person I love, the right to discriminate, etc.)
but they don't."
i literally just posted:

&gt;  is at zero fault and shouldn't be attacked at all.
&gt; the kid's not to blame, however.
It's a kid.
And your takeaway is that I'm saying it's OK to attack kids?
If it's still unclear let me re-iterate: adults should not attack children.
That's only half of what I wrote.

What are you on about?
Mate I didn't take a side in the argument but considering you don't get away with just dropping a quote without explaining it in highschool, I don't think you should here either.

The concept of "Betters" is related to a structure where people are rewarded for not having done much but still ending in a position of favour.
They could get there by birth, or profit or corruption.
That gets entrenched and then becomes expected, and lots of people strive to achieve that level of Betterness.
The newly rich are famous for exhibiting betterment by behaving badly towards anybody "lower" than them on  their particular ladder.
The already rich are more generally seen as more discrete in their brutality.
A common feature is the sucking up to those higher on their ladder.

They don't like it when you call them out on their sophistry.
Hijacking a top comment to point out that the author of the article and the kid are stupid.
Our nation is young.
The continent is old and previous nations existed here, but our current nation of australia is young.
If you disagree with this then you don't understand what the word nation means.
They don't like it when you call them out on their tribalist hypocrisy.
Describes this circlejerk comment chain to a T.
Are you one of the circlejerkers who downvotes everyone?

Summary: 
&gt; the kid's not to blame, however.
I do think  there's blame on both sides.
They don't like it when you call them out on their sophistry.

It's alright when you do it but not when the other side does?
How do they do that?
How do they do what?
