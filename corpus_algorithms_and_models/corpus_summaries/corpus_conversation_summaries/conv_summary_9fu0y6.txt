Green will need that 40% for his upcoming potential lawsuits.
Andrei 224??
That cant be right, hes usually in the 250 range.
Still hope Taisumov starches him.
Lean mean resurgence!
He's on that Keto diet.
Going to 205 after this wtf.
MMA Junkie had it at 244, I believe.
Thanks!
Just corrected it.
I'll be here 10AM fresh as fuck, ready to bang all day long with you bozos, my dudes.
Andrei was never 250.
Aside from the main/co main, this entire card is “Fighter I know vs.
Fighter I’ve never heard of.”.
Man, the pitbull.
He's been in the game long enough.

Summary: 
Going to 205 after this wtf.
He's on that Keto diet.
