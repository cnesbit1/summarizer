That's ridiculous.

*As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.
*
Why are you quoting this to me?
You're not cursed.
Relax.
Twins aren't cursed...
I have to agree with our friend here.
This is ridiculous.
You know, some people just have awful luck - remember Job?
My family is this way - it gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to others, that, no matter how bad things get, if you maintain faith, integrity, and compassion, you can still be completely happy and make the world a better place for others.
See my response to you .

Same idea.
Curses are not curses, but opportunities.
I never said all twins were cursed.
At least throughly read before you give your uneducated opinion.
Alright I'll humour you.
Why do you think you're cursed?

Well like I said in my OP (if you would just read), according to my grandmother, her pastor picked up on a curse before we were born.
According to the Christian YouTuber I watched, these are the obvious signs of cursed twins:

1.
Hate each other
2.
Constantly fight
3.
Constantly Disobey their parents
4.
Compete with one another 
5.
Bring constant misery and pain to their mother 

My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.
My twin sister and I have a very odd, lowly life right now.
It almost seems unreal how fast our life turned around...how fast we hit rock bottom.
We both struggle with mental issues that makes it hard for us to be normal independent adults.
Wow, and with that, we are done.
Enjoy your curse, sweetheart.

Just FYI, #1-5 are all things totally within your control - not the stuff of curses, just choices.

You keep telling me how unspiritual I am and suggesting I get saved, but at the same time are nothing but rude.
I see now that you’re just trolling for a fight.
Unfortunate that you would use a Christian sub to do such a thing, but c’est la vie.
I won’t give you your fight.
But I will pray for you - I will pray that God graces you with compassion and respect for others.
Have a lovely or horrible day, whichever makes you the happiest.
God bless!

The only uneducated opinions you are getting is from YouTube and these people filling your head with this curse nonsense.

Rude.

How do they know?
How does one 'detect' a curse?
&gt; 1.2.3.4.5.
All these are things that siblings (and children in general) do... My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.
Then work on being more loving towards your sister.
&gt; We both struggle with mental issues that makes it hard for us to be normal independent adults.
This is the most reasonable things you've said here.
&gt;er pastor picked up on a curse before we were born.
There's your uneducated opinion.
&gt;these are the obvious signs of cursed twins:

Those are not signs of cursed twins, its called NORMAL sibling rivalry.
&gt; Keep proving your ignorance.
You post something, then attack anyone who gives helpful responses.Why did you post at all?
&gt; ou people are a dead church.
Just a bunch of non-spiritual, uneducated, religious worldly minded people.

Lol.
Never said they weren't within my control.
Curses do not make you behave a certain way.
Get educated before you speak.
I might be able to agree with the "narcissist" part of your username, but timid?
Nah.
Timid people don't pick fights.
