Enjoy the fights!
Get HYPE!
Treating tonight like a UFC fight night.
Got the bud and snacks ready.
First Bellator card I've watched.. hoping for some excitement!
Is this fight televised or do you have to have DAZN?
Bud light?.
What about the corn nuts.
Core to the corn!
!
Get you a Dazn free trial fren.
Have to have DAZN but free month trial to sign up right meow, no contract.
Awesome, thanks!
Is there no other way to watch it on tv other than Dazn (besides illegally)?
Prelims are on dazn Facebook and Twitter and Bellator.com.
Main event I think you need the app though.
Oh no, not that bud lol.
Don’t count on it.
Unfortunately no it seems like DAZN is the only way to view the main card.
Smoke up.
Which is unfortunate becasue this would do good numbers, but im not the biggest fan of throwing my credit card info into random people.
put it on paramount.
Actually dig this DAZN app and the sign up/free month input was super easy.
App works smoothly, only thing I could complain about is it not playing in the background when you move from the app.
The event feels bigger to me than bellator previous, I also really like the tournament for the welterweight division.
Go Scott Coker!
Bellator intern sighted.
Nice try.
Lol far from it, I work at a deli.
Bellator's deli.nice try.
bellator deli intern confirmed.
Shit.
No they only have a pancake house I wouldn’t know.
Prove it, what is pastrami made out of?
Beef.
ok your story checks out.
Jeremy?
That’s my name.
Who are you?
Guys like Half an hour till I can get home am I gonna miss it?
[deleted]
Lima/Koreshkov is up next, then Rampage/Silva, then main event, I think you'll make it by Rampage/Silva.
The main event?
No, you’ll catch that.
No they're going like two fights an hour.
Lima fight coming up.
You may miss the 1st round of Lima-koreshkov.
3 fights left, i think.
hurry.
No, there is two more fights before main event.
Youll definitely see the main event,  free trial on dazn.com cancel after event is over.
I'd say you have time for the main event.
I imagine they’ll draw out the entrances for the old timers, you should be good!
Unless we get a 1st round KO.
Edit; we still have Lima/ Kor as well.
You good!

Summary: 
No, there is two more fights before main event.
