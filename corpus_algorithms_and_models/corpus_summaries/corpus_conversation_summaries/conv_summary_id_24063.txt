Original Response: 
Removed - Direct links to images, blog posts will be removed.
I don't understand.
Why wouldn't you want a direct link?
Isn't everybody directly linking?
Sorry about that, I was unclear.
Direct links to images is what we want, not 21 page slideshows.
And is there even a way to view those images uncensored on that page?
Isn't this a direct link to an image?.
I agree the 21 pages and censoring is annoying but it's on topic so why boot it?
By direct links to images we mean things like http://i.imgur.com/XCek9.jpg or http://i.imgur.com/kBEmT.jpg.
Though an album would be fine, here are the images from your page minus John Travolta - http://imgur.com/a/xiB6u---You can post that if you like.
