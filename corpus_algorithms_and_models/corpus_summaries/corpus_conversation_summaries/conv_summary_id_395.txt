Original Response: 
I was taking a walk at lunch and wondered what the heavy smoke was (visible at least from Swantner Park).
Due to a power outage, Valero plant is using ground flares, according to Caller-Times.

They say it's just ground flares.
But Valero has protocol in effect that doesn't allow call outs and trucks to roll if it's just a flare.
And several fire departments got call outs and all of them rolled trucks.
I think someone was storing material next to one of the ground flares, I've done it before, and it caught fire.
That's a Bingo.

Summary: 
They say it's just ground flares.
