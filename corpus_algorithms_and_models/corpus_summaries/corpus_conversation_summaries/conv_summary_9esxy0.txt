Original Response: 
Saad/Panarin probably.
2 seasons of Panarin&gt; 4 seasons of Saad at the same cap hit.
Tbf, they had 2 seasons of Panarin and didn't win a playoff series.
I mean at this point they've only had 1 season of Panarin, chill.
I meant Chicago.
But Saad might not have regressed and maybe wouldve had chemistry with Dubois, and maybe would re sign with us.
Even the guy from Vancouver doesn’t realize how much we suck.
Considering he signed an extension for 6 instead of just using the O’Reilly method to reach UFA faster that was a good sign already he would have stayed.
No thx.
those regularly scheduled playoff battles still feel like yesterday.
How, yall suck and we suck, that feels so far away.
nostalgia is warm and cozy.

Not when Chicago was going to lose Panarin for nothing at the end of his deal and they had just lost Hossa forever.
I don't know what it is people don't understand about that trade and why it has to be explained every single time.

Summary: 
nostalgia is warm and cozy.
Tbf, they had 2 seasons of Panarin and didn't win a playoff series.
