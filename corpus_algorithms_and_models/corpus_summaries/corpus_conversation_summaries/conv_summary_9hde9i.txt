Original Response: 
Submission Statement- I hope there will be some good support for him.
Big Tech is the Deep State.
They’ve now been making their move on other voices.
Hopefully he’ll get some major support.
Nope- Controlled opposition.
He is hated by the Trump base more than the leftist he is meant to trigger.
You are controlled opposition.
Alex is hated by the trump base?
lol what?
He is constantly on the front page of r/thedonald.
I am in the sea of red- they believe he is controlled opposition.
They believe he is being censored because he had lost influence over them and this gives cause for potential rallying around him- 

No rally as of yet beyond talk of IBOR or other solutions to social media problems.
Alex has been dogged for years about being a potential Mossad asset within the conspiracy community.
These rumors have now entered the Trump base.
Truth will come out- 
Mossad rumors are once again swirling in his space.
&gt;I am in the sea of red

Why did you say "they" instead of "we"?
Are you like some political discussion board double agent?
And regarding Alex Jones, I think the Mossad rumors themselves are the actual psyop.
*swirling!

“They”- habit from talking to Left-leaning people in Austin.
To each his own- .
Perhaps he can argue it was all due to Kelly, gotta say most of us where shocked after her disappearing act that she was granted that level of custody and that he didn’t fight it.
Nice try, Vlad.

Summary: 
Alex is hated by the trump base?
I am in the sea of red- they believe he is controlled opposition.
These rumors have now entered the Trump base.
