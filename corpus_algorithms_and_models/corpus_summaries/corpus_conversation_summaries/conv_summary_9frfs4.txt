In 9 years, you'll have the mantra tatted on your forehead.
Only if you SODL.
Everyone -- literally everyone -- who has big gains has bought and held through a bear market.
Ask anyone who was around in 2014-2015.
Edit: forgot to add -- at some point you'll be tempted to sell with a 100 percent gain.
Fine, but don't sell it all.
HODL applies when you have gains too.
Nothing worse than selling thinking you'll buy back cheaper then watching it double in a month.
lol wtf.
Borrowing money to buy BTC isn't a good idea.
I can promise you'll regret it if you sell at 8900.
I got in at 375, 3 years ago.
I'm still holding.
You're not supposed to hold everything.
And the rest for a few years.

You didn't lose them if you didn't sell them.
at least this is what I say to myself.
I can promise he'll regret it a lot more when he decides to not break even and fucks himself even harder.
Yes, because the market went down, genius.
If you are an experienced trader of course trading will do better but most people don't have a clue about successful trading.
You think it's insane now?
Try being one of the guys that bought at $19k+ üòù.

And watching profits disappear.
Don't promise things you can't deliver.
"Profits"

Summary: 
Fine, but don't sell it all.
HODL applies when you have gains too.
And the rest for a few years.
I can promise you'll regret it if you sell at 8900.
