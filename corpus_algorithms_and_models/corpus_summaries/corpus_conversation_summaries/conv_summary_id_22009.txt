Where's this from?
Her bed.
It's not on her IG, that's all... just nosey really...
Cheers, Geoff.
I need a lady person to tell me if she is wearing makeup and how much.

Couldn't you just look at the picture?
I can never tell.
I'll think someone isn't wearing makeup then a woman will list off 4 different things they are wearing.
Me neither.
In this picture (I think) she's not wearing any of the brownish base stuff, but there might be some eyelash paint...but as said, just guessing...
Fair enough.
No expert (male) but it looks like possibly just mascara and some lipstick here.

If she wasn't wearing any makeup you would know immediately because you would think she looks ill.
