Don’t.
You’ll end up hating yourself.
Your body, your everything.
You’ll think you’re stained and worthless.
But if you are going to.
Use a condom.
But please don’t.
I’m asking this because I’ve met too many and seen too many women in the aftermath and they hate themselves.
Please don’t.
This smacks of proselytism 
Why should someone feel awful for doing what they like and making others happy.
Uh, I didn’t say someone “should” feel awful, proselytism is an interesting word to pick for it.
I’ve just known several women (honestly both genders but mostly women) who did the same thing, some in an attempt to “regain control” of their bodies after some sexual abuse, others as a way of getting back at their ex’s, and I see the consistent pattern that at the end of these sexual binges.
They hate themselves, call themselves stained and ruined, I knew a woman who couldn’t even masturbate anymore she felt so hideous with herself, she fucked 4 guys at a party the night of a hard break up and several nights after continued, ruined her reputation with a few people which is neither here nor there because people think what they will, but in the comfort and privacy of her own home she couldn’t even touch herself, her own body.
That’s sad.
I’m not being uptight you should be able to fuck as many people as you can get to consent with you, it’s a free country.
However.
That’s fucking sad and it’s sadder to see people in a misguided attempt at support saying “well they are they exception!
They can get away with it and not feel like dirt afterwards!” Maybe she is the one exception.
But so far from the 15 plus people I’ve met who go on these binges, and not 4 people either, knocking their numbers up into the 20’s and thirties, I haven’t seen one say anything positive in the end other than that they didn’t go any higher.
Live your life and enjoy yourself but please don’t use your body as a tool.
That’s all.
It’s worth more and so are you but if this is your choice then so be it I support your ability to make it, regardless of my personal feelings on the matter.
I’m confused, in the first paragraph you say that freedom of your body is great, and you should have sex with as many people as you can, if it doesn’t harm you psychologically 

But then the last bit basically says your body is worth less if you have a lot of sex...
Not what I said.
I meant it’s worth more than being used as a tool, especially considering that tool is what’s keeping you alive and the diseases that can spring into action can change that very quickly.
So it may be a better idea to keep it healthy and safe instead of using it in situations that have a much higher chance of permanently fucking you over in anything but the fun way.
I think I understand your confusion but yea, not what I said or meant.
And if you’re in a situation where sex won’t mentally scar you in any way I’m guessing it’s a safe scenario and that may be stretching but I think it’s a fair stretch of that, ie the average little to-no std risk scenario.
Yeah, guess it depends on the person 

Would you say it’s even across the sexes or more relevant to women?
Across no doubt but I think men repress it more.
Though I think it hits women harder from a societal and personal view.
I know after I lost my first love I went on a hard binge and made some... more than questionable decisions.
Even ruined a relationship.
It depends on the person I agree but the people who can do it and do it safely I believe are far and few between.
But yea, I think it honestly does hit women more and men less but does affect both on a somewhat comparable scale.
Interesting 
I have only had one partner, but I would consider sex to be a shared activity for me, like any other... it’s better with someone you love no doubt, but I’d have no problem sharing it with just an acquaintance if I liked them as a person.
That said I’m an atypically stable human do my opinion may be on the fringe.
I agree, sex is honestly mind blowing with someone you love, though fucking your friends is fair in my opinion, I’ve had a girl friend or two who I’ve been more than ok hooking up with and possibly more than once.
Nice.
I think I’d avoid actual friends, too many strings, but I like travelling, so if I were single the odd few days with a nice person I meet would be a ok 👍🏼.
Fair, mainly though because if I can’t talk to someone I def can’t fuck them, like...
I honestly can’t sleep with stupid but yea that’s understandable.
Yeah stupids probably a no go for me too,   
Talking stage usually filters those out though.
Fair point in deed, it was a pleasure sharing thoughts, hope you have a good one though cause I’m crazy fucking tired, adios.
Kk, sleep well 😄.
Que sigues follando con éxito y sin vergüenza 😉.
Lol indeed, have a good one😂👌🏿.
Whoa.
It amazes me how people get down voted for expressing thoughts of caution.
Thank you for being sincere.
Yea it’s fine, my down votes were actually lower yesterday, or, earlier this morning?
Fuck, yea it’s all good lol.
Perfect answer.
Thanks!
And wtf it’s so weird when I initially posted I had -4 downvotes and now they’re going up tf😂.
Dissenting thoughts are not required or desired here, apparently.
I think maybe she already feels that.. that's why she wants to be wanted by everyone.
But I think you're right; her self esteem has a much higher chance of plummeting..
Saying "you will hate yourself" is not cautionary its ignorant becuse what happened to you is not necessarily what will happen to anyone else.
That’s a good point, but I didn’t take that as a literal outcome.
It seemed more like hyperbole.
I’m a literal whore and I don’t think I’m stained or worthless.
I don’t hate myself at all.
I think it’s bloody brilliant.
It’s not for everyone, sure, but it’s one of the best decisions I ever made.
(I use condoms obviously)
Um, ok, then I’m happy that you’re living your life and living it well.
Though I’m very interested could you tell me why it was such a great decision or “bloody brilliant” as you put it?
I’ve learnt so much about myself and about people, my confidence has soared, my emotional intelligence has improved, I don’t have to worry about money, I get to make people happy and feel good about themselves, I get to have exciting and new experiences and meet people I would never normally come into contact with, I get to travel, I’m independent, and it just suits me perfectly.

Summary: 
I don’t hate myself at all.
I think it’s bloody brilliant.
But if you are going to.
Fuck, yea it’s all good lol.
Across no doubt but I think men repress it more.
I think I understand your confusion but yea, not what I said or meant.
You’ll end up hating yourself.
You’ll think you’re stained and worthless.
I’m a literal whore and I don’t think I’m stained or worthless.
