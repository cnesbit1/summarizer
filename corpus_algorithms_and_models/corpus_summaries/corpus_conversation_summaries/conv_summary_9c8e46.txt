Woah.
I commented too soon haha.
Sorry for deleting that comment.
The NHK in gen 7 is being discussed in another trade.
Would you add something from your side along with the Code for the Pika?
Btw which Pika were you taking about, the parade one or the caf√© One?
Would be interested mainly in the gen 6 ray anyway.
[List](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/9baf5k/ft_pal_celebi_and_kg_codes_other_stuff/) of stuff Id be most willing to part with.
Either Pika is aite.
I'll do the Naive Yokohama Pikachu for the Code.
Aite thanks!
Ill keep that in mind.
Let me fish for a few more offers please?
And sorry for the late reply.
