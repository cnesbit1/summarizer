Hey there sooo just wondering if there are any mamas in Corpus Christi looking for a friend!
We just moved here from Phoenix, AZ in October and haven't really made any friends yet.
I'm 30 years old nerdy gal with a 7 month old awesome baby boy.
I'm a caffeine addict, arts and crafts and video game lover and very non-judgy of others.
Be my friend?
ðŸ˜Š.
My wife owns a fitness studio with a kids room and sounds a lot like you.
If you are interested in meeting up there to let the kiddo play and meet her message me and I'll give you the address.
Hey did u find any friends?
