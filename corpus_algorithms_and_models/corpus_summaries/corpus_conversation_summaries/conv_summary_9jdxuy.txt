If you have any question that's not already answered somewhere : just ask (especially if you don't know some terms used).
Thanks for reading !
I got:

- wimpod (fast)

- Squirtle (lure) 

- jangmo-o (heavy)
Sure, what do you want in exchange ?
I would like:

- Pidgey (fast)

- chikorita (friend) 

- growlith (fast)
Okay, I have them on hand, I'll add you.
Will add back.
The first code on flair?
Yes, I'll use my 1st FC.
Added.
Thanks for the trade !
The squirtle is missing 1 EM btw that's why I didn't trade the pidgey :)
I understood!
My fault for not thoroughly reading.
Did you want a Jangmo with the other 2 EGM?
Uh yes, I just saw that the jangmo-o has no EMS and no HA.
I'll breed them onto it myself but so you know : it's clearly written in my post that I only trade for mons with HA + 4 EMS.
Oh man, I thought bulletproof was for some reason the HA.
Okay I will look through what you dont have, and will get a proper HA aprimon 4egm for the screw up.
Nah it's okay, happens :)
I got:

- Chansey Healer (love) heal bell, present, seismic toss and metronome

- togepi Super Luck (Moon) Future sight, extrasensory, nasty plot, and mirror move.
Double checked, HA and egm.
I'll just take the pidgey for these 2.
I'm really sorry about that.
You don't need to, but I'll happily trade for both :)
I understand I don't need to but it was an avoidable mistake so I just want to make it fair.

Thanks for the trade :)
Thank you for reconsidering the trade!, still very sorry about the previous trade.
I look forward to trade you any HA 4EGM aprimon you dont have if that's okay.
It's okay, it happens, and I'm thankfull for the togepi and chancey.
I'm also looking forward trading with you again :)
Likewise, would I just message you here?
