Original Response: 
Yo lets freakin Drone it up!!!
I haven't really been anywhere or to any parks yet with my phantom, an I wanna meet up with any fellow drone flyers so we can well talk drones and stuff.
I live in San Antonio but my parents live out close to WoW (way out weber).I usually fly out there when I visit them but only on the weekends when the Cabaniss field NOLF is not operational.
Gotta figure out how to use it first.
Just haven't taken the time.
Maybe ya'll could help me get started?
Have a Mavic.
I've seen people with drones and model airplanes at bill Witt park off Cimarron and Yorktown.
I have a phantom, hmm there a little different but the same maker, I might be able to?
Fire it up and do all the initial updating that takes forever.
We have a good group of FPV quad racers that meet up at Bill Witt sometimes.

to be more specific though, we don't really fly the "drones" you are speaking about.
We are flying 250mm and smaller FPV racing quads.
Is there way I could maybe join y'all I personally don't use Facebook I just I just don't like to use Facebook or if there's a way that I can maybe like an hour conversation with y'all maybe outside of Facebook somehow that he really cool song I plan on turning my DJI phantom into a first person view drone I just getting The parts ordered tell me more about yawls group and when Joe's next meet up.
We could always start a group.
