Original Response: 
I'm really confused right now, there's a thread on the front page full of people saying the redacting the docs would be a good thing and the right move to protect assets.
It doesn't make sense to me, I would love to see the docs unredacted to know exactly wtf is going on and I would think any person would as well, not sure why people want their info to be filtered but it makes me wonder if anyone else was trying to release the unredacted docs to show Trump's guilt how may people would be right on board.
The same people behind "Muh Russia collusion" were behind the fabricated evidence to support invading Iraq.
They don't like being exposed.
Manipulation is delicate business.

Never underestimate how many shills are astroturfing.
Exactly...
They are pumping this talking point into social media, don't buy it.
People like transparency.
A couple things to keep in mind that might help clear up some of your confusion over this.
1) Only very specific pages are to be released unredacted.
That isn't done to increase your understanding of wtf is going on, it is done to help me do the waters.
2) There is an active investigation that this information is tied to, and by revealing sources and methods, that allows the parties being investigated to tamper with witnesses/evidence.
3) Trump is desperate to stop Mueller's investigation at any cost, even endangering national security just so he has the "grounds" to fire Rosenstein.
In Trump's mind, it is "Trump first, everything else a distant second."
Weren't these pages already released redacted due to their significance in the case and Trump is just going to re-release them without the redactions for clarification, or am I mistaken?
&gt;People like transparency.
Which people?
Seems to be a complete lack of citizens demanding transparency.
If you think it's one political party causing the problems, you're naive.
It's all of them.
right except when nunes released his memo, democrats were blocked by trump from releasing theres.
then trump allowed democrats to release it, but only if redacted.
so who didnt want the public to know the truth then?
and even now trump is only releasing 20 pages of a 400 page document thats heavily redacted.
the pages that he isnt releasing provide the basis of the claims being made in the fisa application.
trump is cherry picking information to present a fasle narrative just like nunes did.
Sheeple know the truth will disturb them.
They just banned 20 subs full of these supposedly non-existent folks.
If it was fully redacted they'd say it's irresponsible but if it's partially redacted they say it's cherry-picked.
Like when Trump released his taxes, that kind of transparency.
Goy don't think.
They're told how to feel and they react because it doesn't make sense and they trust their elected officials blindly.
They're young to express themselves and enjoy life and is ramps out of control.
They need lots of timeouts to grow out of it.
How is making statements on a website going to change government?
[deleted]
Show me that the party you write of is completely behind the idea you write of.
Change public opinion and you can change the government.
Republicans aren’t doing this to help expose corruption, they would be more than happy to keep the charade going but Trump is dragging them along, kicking and screaming as they go.
If they had a valid opportunity to be rid of Trump they would take it in a heartbeat.
So why has that not been working?
I think you are mistaken.
Trump has requested that they release the very specific pages he wants unredacted, while leaving others redacted still.
He so far has not taken it upon himself to do it.
They are now basically saying no we aren't going to do that.
I believe he can do this himself, but politically it would look much more suspect than it does already.
Isn’t that what the Democrats are moaning about with Russian bot farms and their FB meme farms?
[deleted]
There’s too many outlets to control, they weren’t ready for alternative media to be so popular online.
It was easier when they just had to dig into cable companies, with the advent of social media there was just too many ways for people to get information.
That’s why you’re seeing a big step forward in AI censorship.
Understood.
However, I don't think that answers the question of 'why have questions on social media not been able to change government"?
I think I have part of an answer; the media they use to converse is the same media that does not look to identify bots to the users.
If such social media services are not going to do the due diligence to figure out which users are automated, they are exacerbating the issue of fake political/economic/global-conflict information being passed around..
There does not need to be censorship, just awareness.
The full records were released with redactions.
This declassification only unredacts certain pages (less than 10%).
This is the only time in my 42 years on this planet, and in the United States where I have seen the media say "Don't leak this, it will harm national security."
That’s just it.
If the Mueller Investigation and the Russia probe are legit, then the FISA Docs and text messages should prove it so why don’t they want them declassified?
And right before the midterms?
That would be a slam dunk.
Trump Guilty of Russia Collusion!!!
They aren’t cheering because they know exactly what these declassified documents are going to show.
Whataboutism 
&gt;	a reversal of accusation, arguing that an opponent is guilty of an offense just as egregious or worse

Comparing tax returns to falsifying intelligence data to invade countries and strain geopolitical relationships lol.
Clearly I was replying to the statement, "People like transparency".
I believe that transparency should not be confined to just the things people believe in or want to be uncovered, it should be agnostic.
Well, it's my understanding that the pages he's requesting be unredacted are the ones that were already released redacted as they contain the most pertinent information, personally I'd love to see all of them released but again unless I'm mistaken in all this Trump is just unredacting the pages that were already released which seems reasonable if it contains the most relevant information.
Obviously I'd love to see them all and decided whether or not they're relevant myself but even just seeing the pages that were already released without redactions is better than nothing and I don't understand why anyone would not be okay with that.
edit: Okay it seems like all of the pages were released redacted and he's only removing the redactions on certain pages, I understand fully now.
Still, as much as I'd love to see all of the unredacted pages I still won't argue with removing the redactions for a portion for a glance at the full picture at the very least.
edit 2: Also, if the DOJ/FBI is unhappy with only redacting a portion because it will distort the full picture couldn't they just release the rest unredacted as a means of informing everyone on the entirety of it?
Ah okay that makes sense, so the idea is that the ones he is redacting are the most pertinent?
Personally would love to see all of it unredacted but I'm not going to complain at seeing at least some of it in full to get a better idea as to what is going on.
More pertinent?
Or cherry picked to show evidence that they agree with while hiding evidence or analysis to show how the unredacted pages are wrong or out of context?
The question becomes why unredact these specific pages and not the rest.
As with any document release, what is not shown/released can be just as important to the story as what is shown.
If CNN or Wikileaks had a full set of documents and only released certain parts that bolster their story, then both CNN and Wikileaks are not lying but they are definitely crafting a narrative.
This is why sharing of exculpatory evidence is critical in our legal system.
&gt; Still, as much as I'd love to see all of the unredacted pages I still won't argue with removing the redactions for a portion for a glance at the full picture at the very least.
The problem being what if the picture that is released is a pic of Hillary eating a baby with a big censored black spot next to it.
Seems like we caught her eating a baby right?
Well what if the black spot next to her is covering Trump holding a gun to her head?
I realize that is a ridiculous thing I just wrote, but my point is having just part of a picture can shape your perception of the entire picture even if the rest of the picture you can't see completely changes that perception later.
&gt;Also, if the DOJ/FBI is unhappy with only redacting a portion because it will distort the full picture couldn't they just release the rest unredacted as a means of informing everyone on the entirety of it?
No, it is still an ongoing thing.
Releasing certain info could allow those they are investigating to obstruct justice because now they know what we have on them.
They can tamper with witnesses, destroy evidence, and so on.
So they themselves would never give their targets this sort of info.
What exactly is suspect?
&amp;#x200B;

If the theory is proven that they fabrictated all of this stuff and used guys like Page &amp; Popadopolous to spy on Trump and hamper the first 2 years of his presidency... is he just supposed to let it go?
say nothing?
&gt; where I have seen the media say "Don't leak this, it will harm national security."
I think you are confused.
Maybe you are *watching* "media" when (for example) Congressman Schiff goes on TV to express his concern about protecting intelligence sources, etc.
**That is a US Congressman, duly elected, an expert because of his position as a leader of the House Intelligence Committee, expressing his expert opinion.
** The media is *not* saying it -- the media is just *reporting* it.
See the difference?
&gt; so why don’t they want them declassified?
Because, as many have said, revealing the classified information will reveal sources and methods that the intelligence community wants to keep secret.
Why are YOU ignoring those statements?
&gt; They aren’t cheering because they know exactly what these declassified documents are going to show.
Yes, they will show sources and methods that they want to keep secret for the sake of national security.
Why is that difficult for you to understand?
That is a total lie.
For one thing, even if the president declassified the entire document, they still leave all sources and methods that would compromise ongoing operations or investigations redacted.
That’s what this review process is for.
The Intel agencies review the docs again and submit any information they feel should remain redacted along with the reasons why.
Remember when Shifty Schiff and the hysterical MSM was claiming releasing the Memo was revealing “sources and methods”?
Yeah.
No sources and methods.
You know exactly what’s in it.
That’s why you’re here spreading that lie about sources and methods.
No, they opposed releasing the **FISA warrants** unredacted because they would expose sources and such.
They opposed the Nunes memo because they said it was biased political spin - which is turned out to be, once the *still-partially-redacted* FISA applications/warrants were released.
Your down votes tell me you are over the target, I hate reddit for their bias...fuck the down votes &amp; good for you to speak up.
&gt;What exactly is suspect?
Why selectively release some and not all?
If what you say is true and it can be proven they fabricated all of this stuff to do what you say above then releasing all of it will have the same affect as releasing selected parts of it.
Right?
It'd be a bombshell, lots of people would eat crow, and investigations would be shut down.
So why release specific parts of it allowing people to say "well there must be more context in the rest of it".
Allowing the investigations to continue.
In fact releasing the whole thing, again going with your assumption this is all fabricated stuff to spy on Trump and hamper his presidency, is the only way to completely prove that.
So by releasing some and not all allows doubt that he is telling the truth to remain and the investigation will continue.
So what exactly is suspect about this if he does this on his own is if he releases some and not all, bypassing the normal process because his justice department isn't going to do it, it will scream desperation.
If it allows those being investigated to tamper with witnesses and destroy evidence because now they have more knowledge of what investigators know that will make Trump look even more suspect because it just looks like he is trying to ruin the investigation directly.
I suspect, but keeping in mind this is Trump so it could happen, that he won't release anything on his own and will play that angle versus actually releasing anything.
In fact I think the prevalent theory is that he knew they wouldn't do what he asked and now believes he has a reason to fire people without consequence.
Allowing him to appoint people who will stop the investigation without letting us see what is in that warrent.
We'll see what route he goes.
Another lie.
You know you can easily find many videos online of Nancy Pelosi, Swallwell, and all the rest of those stooges along with CNN and MSNBC with their Intelligence Consultants, screaming about National Security and Sources and Methods over the Nunes memo right?
You can also go straight to the source on the Executive Declassification Process.
That's also available online.
But here's the biggest problem with Sources and Methods.
The same people within the Intel community screaming about Sources and Methods leaked the entire 82 page unredacted FISA warrant to the media in March of 2017 who is also coincidentally crying about Sources and Methods.
The Media has had the full unredacted FISA warrant for over a year.
[Revisiting the Page FISA Applications &amp; James Wolfe Indictment](https://themarketswork.com/2018/08/02/revisiting-the-page-fisa-applications-james-wolfe-indictment/)

&gt;According to the [Wolfe Indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/press-release/file/1069836/download), on March 17 2017 Wolfe [**exchanged**](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/press-release/file/1069836/download) **82 text messages with reporter Ali Watkins,** and that evening engaged in a 28-minute phone call with her.
&gt;  
&gt;The Original **Page FISA Application is 83 pages long.
Including one final signatory page** ([h/t the Conservative Treehouse](https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2018/07/23/indicted-senate-staffer-james-wolfe-leaked-a-2017-copy-of-full-fisa-warrant-against-carter-page-to-reporter-ali-watkins/)).
&gt;  
&gt;It seems more than plausible that Wolfe took pictures of the Original FISA Application and sent them by text to Watkins.
&gt;  
&gt;Perhaps even more important:  
&gt;  
&gt;What Wolfe sent was almost certainly an **unredacted** version.
&gt;  
&gt;In the public version of the Original Page FISA Application there are **37 fully redacted pages**(out of 83 total).
Several other pages have redactions for all but the header.
There are **only two pages in the entire document** that contain no redactions.
&gt;  
&gt;Why would Wolfe bother to send 37 pages of complete redaction.
[Wolfe’s Indictment, Media Leaks &amp; the Page FISA Application](https://themarketswork.com/2018/07/28/wolfes-indictment-media-leaks-the-page-fisa-application/)

&amp;#x200B;

There is a major FBI and IG investigation going on right now into these leaks and these declassified docs are going to answer questions for the public that these investigators have known from the start.
Lol dude hace you wandered into the wrong sub?
Henerallu anti-estalbishment posts in here fella or did you not get the memo?
Maybe you got the redacted version...
Don't you think if they had anything at all that it would have leaked by now?
Whatever the topic is if something hasn't leaked about it I don't see that as a valid reason to assume it doesn't exist, or as proof that it does exist either for that matter.
It is kind of a moot point for me.
&gt; Because, as many have said, revealing the classified information will reveal sources and methods that the intelligence community wants to keep secret.
Why are YOU ignoring those statements?
Because those people sell drugs.
Well, that shut him up.
Well done.
Yep, the NYT were leaked the FISA long ago.
James Wolf is being charged for it.
Is this a joke?
The fact that the Clinton team pushed the russia hacking story to the media as a PR stunt to deflect from her embarrassing loss is a big part of all of this.
The popadopolous 14 days in jail is also huge.
People have been leaning on him for a while now.
He's obviously not a smoking gun of any sorts if he's only getting 14 days.
Look at the Arab spring.
Social media can change governments.
Funny that in the west, since then, there's been a huge crack down on social media and 'alternative' news.
Regulations, censorship,  huge media campaigns to corner small political markets.
They're scared, but right now they're winning.
What exactly will text messages reveal that will compromise national security?
Sources?
Well, that’d be the people sending the texts.
We already know who they are.
Methods?
Well, that would be whatever electronic means they have of capturing text messages.
Hardly anything revolutionary.
The context of the texts, now that may cause a revolution.
&gt;**That is a US Congressman, duly elected, an expert because of his position as a leader of the House Intelligence Committee, expressing his expert opinion.

Are you talking about this Adam Schiff?
&gt;[Russian radio hosts once pranked Adam Schiff with promise of ‘naked Trump’ photos](https://nypost.com/2018/02/07/russian-radio-hosts-once-pranked-adam-schiff-with-promise-of-naked-trump-photos/)  
&gt;  
&gt;Russian radio hosts pranked the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, saying they had compromising images of President Trump, according to a report Tuesday.
&gt;  
&gt;[The Daily Mail posted](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5355713/Adam-Schiff-spoofed-Russian-claim-nude-Trump-pic.html) audio of the prank pulled last year by Vladimir “Vovan” Kuznetsov and Alexey “Lexus” Stolyarov against Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).
&gt;  
&gt;T[he Atlantic reported the prank last month](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/putins-game/546548/), but The Mail story went a step further with purported audio of the joke.
&gt;  
&gt;The caller identified himself as Andriy Parubiy, speaker of Ukraine’s parliament, when “Parubiy” was actually both Kuznetsov and Stolyarov.
&gt;  
&gt;The pranksters claimed Trump had an affair with Russian model and singer Olga Buzova in 2013.
&gt;  
&gt;“She got compromising materials on Trump after their short relations,” the pranksters told Schiff.
&gt;  
&gt;“OK, and what’s the nature (of the material)?” Schiff asked.
&gt;  
&gt;“Well, there were pictures of naked Trump,” said the pranksters, adding that Russian president Vladimir Putin was aware of the compromising material.
&gt;  
&gt;Schiff responded that “obviously we would welcome the chance to get copies.”

&amp;#x200B;
How many of those banned subs were remakes of the original sub?
Why do these people not seem concerned about transparency regarding Trump?
The biggest reveal in the last Strzok Page texts was Strzok saying that Buzzfeed had published the Dossier and that they should use that as a pretext to go out and interview some folks.
Papadapolous just dropped some bombshells last night too saying that he was contacted by a woman working for Aussie Diplomat Downer before he even met with Mifsud.
She also arranged the meeting with Downer at the bar where he allegedly drunkenly talked about the Clinton emails.
It wasn’t some random meeting.
That means that the excuse the FBI gave that the investigation into the Trump campaign started with Papadapolous drunkenly disclosing to Downer that he had dirt from Russians about Clinton was a lie.
Papadalous was set up and he’s willing to testify to the various investigations that he was targeted by deep state intelligence assets.
So much for flipping on Trump.
Reddit doesn't let real humans submit comments to front page subs anymore.
Not all of them, that's for sure.
Lol.
Who is the one "winning" and how is it they are winning, and what will they win?
Has talking about Congressional insider trading on Wallstreet, on the nets, stopped the actual congressional insider trading?
What are you talking about?
The people trump hired got us into Iraq.
The people who voted for bush voted for Trump.
You’re just hilarious.
How old are you?
If you want to focus solely on the media for an illustration take a look at the "Against Trump" issue of National Review.
Every last one of the articles was written by one of the drum beaters for Iraq invasion.
Actually take a look at the issue.
[https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2016/02/15/](https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2016/02/15/)

Then find what those writers had to say about the Iraq invasion in 2001.

Summary: 
then trump allowed democrats to release it, but only if redacted.
The full records were released with redactions.
Why selectively release some and not all?
I think you are mistaken.
I think you are confused.
Several other pages have redactions for all but the header.
People have been leaning on him for a while now.
1) Only very specific pages are to be released unredacted.
Like when Trump released his taxes, that kind of transparency.
** The media is *not* saying it -- the media is just *reporting* it.
