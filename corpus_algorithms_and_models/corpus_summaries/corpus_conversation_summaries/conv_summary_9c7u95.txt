God leaves no room in the bible for evolution.
Jesus tells us we need to believe in the books Moses wrote.
John 5

&gt;46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.
&gt;47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
Paul tells us he believes all the law and the prophets.
Acts 24

&gt;14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:

Peter decries those who take a naturalistic viewpoint of the world, denying creation and the history in the Bible.
2 Peter 3

&gt;1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

&gt;2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

&gt;3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

&gt;4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?
for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
&gt;5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:

&gt;6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:


Not to mention the gospels proclaim in Jesus's genealogy that He is descended from Adam.
Luke 3

&gt;38 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.
I used to believe in evolution as a Christian until I realized what the Bible says.
You must decide if you trust men that deny 
Christ or the words of eternal life.
&gt; You must decide if you trust men that deny Christ 

Accepting the evidence for evolution is not denying Christ.
&gt; You must decide if you trust men that deny 
Christ

So you're saying that the Priest who came up with the Big Bang Theory denies Christ and that the Catholics who theorized about evolution deny Christ.
That's not kind.
(Edit) If Reddit was made by a non-Christian you can't use it or you're trusting in men.
It's aspects of reality that at the core clash with God's spiritual creation.
The teachings of **men** lead one to believe everything is purely physical through evolution coming from the big bang, limiting the mind's perception until we believe to be living on a ball floating in space.
We're not supposed to be able to make it to heaven as men, yet we've been taught that we're practically floating in it.
What if the stars of burning gas above were actually angels in heaven?
Believing in big bang robs them of their [*spiritual nature, along with other things*](https://youtu.be/dDBFhM_ViqM?list=PLmiAycMDMUDPGSb40Ry8kKmTWUh4DCfwf&amp;t=47).
Unfortunately the fields of science aren't immune from [**impostors there to push an agenda**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DikPsj9U8AAgW_V.jpg) *(the agenda being for people to stop believing in God).
* These notions are acceptable to athiests, is that not fishy?
I'm guessing you never heard of the council of nicea.
You know, the gathering where a bunch of priests picked and chose what would go in the King James book.
So in theory, we are mainly trusting in men due to the fact that men discarded what they did not like and kept what they did.
God tells us that we will be able to tell what He has said and what He hasn't.
We've trusted God to keep that promise.
John 10

&gt;4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
&gt;5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
Those pushing these theories are primarily not Christians.
&gt; limiting the mind's perception until we believe to be living on a ball floating in space.
We ARE living on a ball floating in space, floating at a speed of about 2.7 million miles per hour when you add it all up.
&gt;What if the stars of burning gas above were actually angels in heaven?
We have actually seen the stars using astronomy equipment.
&gt;Believing in big bang robs them of their spiritual nature,

You do realize that the Big Bang was first proposed by a Christian priest?
&gt;the agenda being for people to stop believing in God).
Scientists couldn't' care less about whether people beleive in God or not.
&gt;These notions are acceptable to athiests, is that not fishy?
That's like saying that if atheists like fried chicken, Christians shouldn't.
You sound too much like those promoting that flat earth foolishness.
Even if that's true that changes nothing.
Accepting the evidence for evolution is not denying Christ.
&gt;I'm guessing you never heard of the council of nicea.
You know, the gathering where a bunch of priests picked and chose what would go in the King James book.
The Council of Nicea did not choose the books that went into the Bible.
Nor did they ever hear of the King James Bible.
&gt;So in theory, we are mainly trusting in men due to the fact that men discarded what they did not like and kept what they did.
This much is true.
What does this passage have to do with the Bible?
God wrote the Bible.
It is His voice.
We know what He wrote and what He didn't.
That's why I didnt say that it was.
No, God didn't write the Bible.
It was written by a lot of authors over a long period of time.
That's not what the Bible says.
The Bible was not written by the will of man.
2 Peter 1

&gt;21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
It was written by God.
2 Timothy 3

&gt;16 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
The Bible is totally unaware of the Bible.
And 2Tim 3:16 isn’t refering to the Bible nor does it limit scripture to just the Bible.
Thanks for this, friend.
It’s crazy how this sub is called r/Christianity yet most on here make arguments based on doctrine of men, and site no scriptures to argue their points.
It’s so backwards.
If you site scriptures and stand for the Most High, you get downvoted, but if you tell people that all of their sins are okay and that you can do whatever you want (homosexuality, doubt of The Word, Idol worship etc), you get upvoted.
We’re truly in Babylon.
The Word is Jesus, not the Bible.

&gt;*You sound too much like those promoting that flat earth foolishness.

It may sound like foolishness, but what if everything wasn't purely physical?
After all, our brains put the signals together to create the illusion of physicality.
What if everything was made of spirit?
Early genesis can be freely taken at its word and not viewed through a limited lens of big bang physical reality.
It becomes easier to believe we exist on a spiritual plane after assessing the source of proof we get shown.
Living with the technology we have nowadays, surely you can spot some fishy instances.. especially the [low-tech space videos](https://youtu.be/sj6a0Wrrh1g?t=171).
With a bit of youtube surfing the hollywood effects get noticable.
&gt;*We ARE living on a ball floating in space, floating at a speed of about 2.7 million miles per hour when you add it all up.

We get taught a convincing view on reality.
It does make sense.
i used to believe it as well.
However i do not believe God created that which we get taught.
[We couldn't truly make it to outer space back then, merely go a very high altitude.

&gt;*We have actually seen the stars using astronomy equipment.

Seeing something out of our reach doesn't mean we entirely know what it is.
&gt;*You do realize that the Big Bang was first proposed by a Christian priest?

Churches are not immune to infiltrators.
How would we know if any particular person wasn't a secret satanist or not, y'know?
Canaanite ba'al worship also likely came before Christians got introduced to it.
&gt;*Scientists couldn't' care less about whether people beleive in God or not.
*

They have the responsibility of analyzing everything, which affects peoples minds.
Actual scientists are not under blame, only those sent to become a scientist purely to push pagan views.
Facts need to be differentiated from theory, like black holes and the like.
The bible only says the truth and I believe it because of the testimony that stands behind it-the testimony of the church and the witness of the Holy Spirit.
The church has always been comprised of hundreds of individuals who all claimed to witness the same thing.
Hundreds claimed to have seen Jesus in the flesh, seen Him perform miracles, seen Him die on the cross, and see Him resurrected.
These people *were* the early church.
They gave everything they had and even their lives to pass this message on to the next generation of the church.
Those people are **thousands** that met with face to face the hundreds of people that gave everything they had to get that message to them.
They saw that this large group of people had the same testimony of witnessing Jesus.
They then received the Holy Spirit and saw the power of God for themselves in themselves; in miracles of healing, miracles of tongues, and other fruits of the Holy Spirit.
These people then passed this testimony down to the next generation of Christians saying, "Hey, we saw people give their lives out of love to give us this message-that they witnessed God in the flesh as Jesus and His power.
We believed them and told us that because of our belief we would receive the Holy Spirit and we did!"
There are thousands upon thousands of witnesses at this point.
This is why Christianity spread throughout the world.
This is why Christianity has spread to today.
This message has simply been passed down generation to generation with the same testimony, that the people that came before us gave us this testimony in the hundreds, thousands, and millions.
I am a witness of this today, that I have seen the Bible to be true in my life.
I have received the Holy Spirit just as Jesus promised 2000 years ago.
I have seen His power in my life.
The scriptures this passage is talking about is the law, the prophets, and the new testament scriptures.
The Bible defines these things as the scriptures.
Luke 24

&gt;27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.
2 Peter 3

&gt;16 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
God knows everything.
He has always known what the Bible would be.

You're inferring things into those verses that aren't there.
I've shown you with context how the Bible defines scripture.
So what part of the Bible isn't scripture?

Summary: 
That's not what the Bible says.
It was written by God.
The Word is Jesus, not the Bible.
The Bible defines these things as the scriptures.
The Bible was not written by the will of man.
