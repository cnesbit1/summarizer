Original Response: 
Hey y'all,I'm in town for a few weeks and a bushing on my telescope has gone missing.
It's a little plastic cylinder with a hole through it.
I believe the piece is custom made so I really doubt I'd find one in a store.
However, I do have the bushing from the other side, so it occurred to me that I could 3D print and scan it if I knew someone who had one, so I came here.
I'd be more than willing to pay you if you can help!
TL;DR: Telescope broke, need to use 3d scanner replace component.Thanks!
Wish I did, let me know if you find anything.
I would suggest finding a student at tamucc in the engineering program.
The school has a printer and is free for use by enrolled students.
