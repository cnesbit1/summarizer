CC has been trying to revalilize downtown for years and years.
It is a dump still, and always will be.
The Cosmopilitan Apartments are a great example of this.... they were supposed to be complete in 2015.
2 years later and it is still a work in progress, but I use that term lightly because most days there is no work actually being done due to being so far above budget.
I think the taxpayer funded development was always set to fail from the beginning.
I think now they are working not to build attractions but simply to build infrastructure and support private development.
