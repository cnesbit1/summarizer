She looks good with bangs.
She needs to keep that look.
Cigarette photo is a little gross, but I love that first pic.
Don't like the hair, makeup or the cigarette.
I don't think she smokes in real life (could be wrong), but it's a retro, sixties-inspired shoot so a cigarette would have been considered 'cool' back then...
Ya exactly.
Sooo... there is a Yahoo style now?
Bangs, yes.
This kind of makeup, no.
Lots of people who you wouldn't guess are smokers will light one up every once in a while, especially people with high stress jobs.
Some people also just smoke socially.
One of the best photo shoots I've seen in a long time.
