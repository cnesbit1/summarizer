San Antonian here.
Took a day trip to Corpus with my SO this past weekend and we decided to check out the haunted house in the Lexington.
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
We went kind of early so it was just the two of us going through the house, but it was definitely a blast and the actors were great.The $15 admission free may seem a little steep, but it's definitely worth it.

Whhhatttt.I just moved here with my fiance and you just gave us some nice plans for an evening out.
Thank you!
My guess is unlimited visits through the duration of the attraction.
