Original Response: 
Ok so I keep seeing posts that typically would've been ridiculed, dOwNvOtEd, or simply ignored reaching to the top of this sub.
All these shit posts are getting a large amount of upvotes.
Now I post here infrequently, and have had maybe 2 posts gather any real upvotes.
I'll find them later and link them.
My reason for saying this is I believe the same people who banned r/Q, r/Anon, etc.
are trying to AstroTurf this sub into looking like an alt-right hub for the people who were kicked out of the banned subs.
I think it's a strategy for them to use to justify banning this sub by falsely smearing complete crap over us to set up all the ducks in the row for the mighty banhammer.
I know people have said that this sub has gone downhill for awhile now in terms of conspiracy content (too much politics, repeated theories, etc.)
I'm not talking about that.
[I'm talking about posts that link to sites we know for sure someone real here wouldn't link to.
](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/9i4udg/the_fear_that_911_and_an_endless_series_of_staged/?utm_source=reddit-android)  Just my thoughts.
Solidarity.
Mention anything Q here and it triggers the Q haters.
Pretty sure a wave of accounts was created/bought/awakened just for the express purpose of shilling against Q drops.
It's peetty fucking pathetic, that most conspiracies can't be discussed here without someone waving their dick around derailing discussion and name calling.
What is Q?
I see it posted a lot in this sub.
I took a break from Reddit for months.
Q is an alleged military insider with "Q" level clearence (supposedly one of the highest) that begun dropping "crumbs" back in 2016/2017 pointing to a corrupt deep state embedded within the governments of the world.
Since then, his posts have essentially confirmed they work with/for POTUS and military intelligence and they are the communication hub as a direct line to the awakening public as deep state corruption is exposed.
I suggest checking out some of their Q drops.
qanon.app or qmap.pub or qanon.pub or even http://awakeningforums.com/board/26/drops - hope this helps, i only skimmed the surface.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you!
I'll look into it.
I never understood the hate toward Q just as I never understood the hate toward pizzagate, both had their points, counter-points, followers, dissenters, etc.
Neither of these topics appear much different than the plethora of other conspiracies found here on this sub and elsewhere.
Honestly, if you believe 9/11 is a conspiracy (me included) then Q and pizzagate are drops in the ocean.
Why would either be so unbelievable that they need to be ridiculed and silenced?
But, here we are.
This sub can’t mention Q or pizzagate now because of r/TheBanOut2018 and fear that the entire community will be scrubbed from the internet.
The narrative is set, rules and boundaries have been created.
These restrictions will only ever be tightened from here on out.
Yet people defend it like it’s, somehow, the right thing to do.
The proper course of action is never to censor someone, and if you find yourself in that position then you may be on the wrong side of history.
Good god man, gorgeously said!
My exact sentiment.

In that case Q should be discussed and debunked if its that easy to discredit.
Show the video you mentioned where 
&gt;a livestreamer revealed as much when he literally accidentally logged into a Q account on stream

and discuss it.
Show people, educate, debate.
Make it so apparent that any mention of Q is immediately followed by the video disproving it all.
We are not gatekeepers.
Can you really advocate that the proper thing to do here is to harass those who have an interest in it, take away their soapboxes, lead them out of town, and then talk about them once they've left?
Any
&gt; self-respecting conspiracy theorist

would certainly like to make up their own mind before the topic is censored from view by a very powerful social media platform.
It is **entirely possible** that Q and pizzagate are both true AND false.
They could, and likely do, have doses of truth alongside doses of misdirection.
Hypothetically, if pizzagate was proven 100% true but the details of it were **not** that the Clinton foundation was involved, or Podesta, or anything political...would it make it any less of a conspiracy?
Would that somehow make potential child abuse OK?
No, not really, the truths would come out as true and the lies/misdirection would come out as false.
What if it was originally politicized in order to discredit it and make it seem like a partisan issue??
*The problem here is that we've been robbed of even discussing it and the bulk of evidence has been deleted from the internet*.
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, that's the rule.
If this was merely
&gt; people getting sick of certain conspiracies

then they can go to a different website, change the channel, take a break, come up with something new on their own, re-visit old topics...
But to outright and blatantly censor?
That's just being dishonest, and its accepted because Reddit and others have the power to do so.
Talk about a conspiracy!
No doubt there is a pattern of politicalization that has been happening since, at least, 2016.
I would not argue that.
However, does that mean that a topic of conversation should be removed entirely?
Pizzagate had and still has a following (long after the election).
It is clear that the potential wrongdoers in that narrative were democrats...
Does that mean that we should stop looking into it?
If evidence starts to accumulate, but it seems to have some political affiliations, are we to simply turn our heads and forget what we know?
Using that same logic we could say that 9/11 is a right-wing conspiracy and therefore should not be looked into.
What if the details of pizzagate were 100% true, do you think it likely that the conspiracy community would stop there and say "looks like I'm voting republican!"
or is it more likely that the search would continue and that right-wing politicians and establishments would be scrutinized next?
Because, after all, its much more about child abuse than left v. right.
We are not gatekeepers.
I have enough faith in my fellow theorist to allow them to form their own opinions, to make those opinions known, and to debate them.
If the argument falls apart under scrutiny then it was a weak argument, but if it holds together *and is then censored from the internet* what are we to believe?
Hell, if not for those very same theorists (who we are seeking to silence) we may not be here, conversing in this sub, today.

There's a difference between hate and censorship, though.
Would it be unreasonable to theorize that perhaps the hate being spread is also politicized, since its all left v. right?
[deleted]
Pizzagate was the closest we have come to uncovering a massive and very powerful pedophilia network that also had a giant online audience digging into its details and widespread MSM coverage.
As you mentioned it is now pedogate, but that's not getting a lot of coverage, is it?
Its unfortunate that things have to be politicized to garner such widespread attention, but I fail to understand how that disqualifies it as a topic of conversation and justifies its blanket removal from the internet.
Getting a few thousand people on an internet forum to believe something won't amount to much more than personal enlightenment (or something).
It's no coincidence that the one conspiracy which made it all the way to the top is the one being silenced, especially when there was enough truth there that it is still possible to
&gt; rebrand the viable pieces of the puzzle as pedogate and include it in larger, more well established lists of evidence.
Yes, exactly!
This goes beyond left v. right, and we have the intellectual capacity to discern that.
Why then are we, the people, OK with censorship?
This sums it up perfectly.
The pizzagate one, in particular, seems like it's just tongue in cheek.
"What?
We're not saying that all liberals are pedophiles.
We're just presenting "evidence" that all liberals are pedophiles.
YOU be the judge."

But that means if a conspiracy is to be easily discredited, by anyone, all they have to do is politicize it.
I'd guess that sooner or later if you uncovered the truth of any big conspiracy you would eventually hit an elected democrat or republican figure, even just by probability.
If pizzagate uncovered democrats, for whatever reason, then maybe something-else-gate would uncover republicans.
If 9/11 happened in 2018, and a team of democrats investigated the issue because they had reason to suspect that the republican party had something to do with it, and they yelled *republicans are bad and here is why!
* would that warrant banning the topic as politically-charged hate speech from social media platforms?
How would that play be read?
I just don't think we'd be saying 'thank you' to Reddit for censoring information, like we are today.
I guess that's my point.
I don't know what your point is then.
The entire system was bought out, we all fell for it, so let's now justify the banning of information?
We know its more than left v. right so why don't we keep the information around and use that as a piece of the puzzle?
This has set a massive precedent and will justify the banning of more communities in the future, including maybe this sub.
Anyone worth a Damn who has followed SRA / PG stuff does not care which side of the isle the cretins reside...
It was serendipitous that PG found Dems with their pants down.. Had it been the Bush years..as many Reps would have been spotlighted...
Yes, exactly.
We've once again ignored widespread SRA because of political affiliation, but this time we are actually thanking our masters for censoring the information.
Well put..
Look.
We know.
You guys really miss GA.
But this transparent bullshit just isn't going to unchallenged in subs where normal people don't get banned for dissenting.
edit:  I'm not fluent in Altrightish.
Does SRA stand for Socialist Rifle Association?
Satanic Ritual Abuse, a non-partisan child abuse/pedophilia conspiracy topic with possible ties to MKUltra.
How does this have anything to do with GA, and what warrants your ad hominem?
donnie would literally steamroll any of his 'regular people' supporters for the opportunity to sit beside just about any of the super-wealthy 'globalists'.
And the topic of conversation(if they're even bothered to think of them) would be laughing their asses off at what suckers they are.

I’m not goading you to do anything, honestly.
During your explanation of why these topics are hated you seemed to side in favor of their removal.
I understand why these bannings occurred but I don’t understand the hatred because every conspiracy has a left- or right-leaning slant and nothing has been “hated” to this degree before.
...nor did I intend on pushing any talking points.
Sorry if it came off that way I suppose.
Not sure who would benefit from what I said though.
Exactly, wtf is that guy trying to say?
What the fuck is your point.
Oh you're the worst kind of person.
Is your mirror bigger than your ego?
That's just some horseshit you're spreading around.
First off, you've got no fucking proof.
Second, stop spreading your horseshit around.
You just keep saying the same thing without any fucking proof.
And I'm not saying I believe all this Q shit but you can't just shoot shit down without fucking proof!

Everybody wants to tell everybody their opinion.
For how much every body thinks they fucking know everything, *they never know when to shut up*.
I don’t know dick about Q, and I’m sure as hell not gonna look it up.
And guess what?
*I don’t talk about Q*.
I don’t downvoted y’all, and I don’t disagree.
Subreddits aren’t just for ME.
If I can’t let somebody have a good conversation just because I disagree, then I’m hurting the very space I want to use.
That's good for you man.
It doesn't take two fucking seconds, it takes so much time.
And you don't have to feed me anything but some proof of the claims you're making.
[removed]
lol I've looked at t\_d about 5x total since it started.
Not sure how you got the idea I was criticizing your post.
[removed]
What are you talking about?
I don't see any ad hominem in what I said.
I merely acknowledged his apparent grief after recently losing a sub that he was extremely active in.
If people  decide to judge him based on the information I provided, that's their choice.
&gt;I never understood the hate toward Q just as I never understood the hate toward pizzagate, both had their points, counter-points, followers, dissenters, etc.
Because accusing people of child molestation/rape/sacrifice/whatever the fuck they believe is a very heavy, serious charge.
One that you should never, ever make unless you have direct evidence.
Oddly worded phrases from leaked emails and the faux-cryptic ramblings of a 4chan troll do not count.
Being falsely labeled as someone who harms children can ruin someone's life.
That's why there is push back from people who can clearly see how these "conspiracies" are nothing more than a politically motivated witchhunt to demonize the President's enemies.
I see your point, especially about hiding evidence to protect certain individuals, but I don’t think it necessarily discredits anything.
If pizzagate had kept its wings and was able to blow Comet Ping Pong wide open, and everything associated with it, that would be revolutionary.
Even if every person who was involved in wrongdoing was democrat it would still be a ginormous and worthy event.
The aftermath, I think, is what we disagree on.
Any “win” for the republicans would be short lived as this information would now be widespread and known to the masses.
Right now it would take another pizzagate-esque event to reach that possibility again, and it’s taboo to discuss now so we will almost certainly never find out.
What was said had nothing to do with GA though.
Real child pedophilia rings are being uncovered but they lack the widespread MSM coverage that pizzagate had.
These topics are still being discussed, just not Comet Ping Pong and those involved.
The church is now in the news again for the same reason yet that information is not being censored.
so blaming the saudis or Israelis for blowing up the towers isnt a serious charge?
The lies and shadiness(crimes) of the democrats is swelling up like a balloon.
I cant wait until it pops.
I call bullshit.
Debunked back in August?
When, where, how and why?
And what debunked how?
All the time with you and your "it takes a small amount of of Google to receive answers."
You're spreading bullshit, not even, you're spreading flea-shit.

Summary: 
I would not argue that.
*I don’t talk about Q*.
I don't know what your point is then.
