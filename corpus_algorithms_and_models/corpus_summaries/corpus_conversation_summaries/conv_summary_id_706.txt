Perception is limited.
Ants do not see the human, only squishy bark with salt flesh.
Children do not know the time, the have so little of it behind them.When you look in the mirror, you look into yourself in the past.
You cannot see into the lives of those you cannot comprehend because you have not seen them for the larger picture.
There's no larger picture than what's within, perhaps you see the past..
I wish I was on your level.
I was just high, so it's a pretty small wish away.
Lol okay.

Summary: 
I wish I was on your level.
