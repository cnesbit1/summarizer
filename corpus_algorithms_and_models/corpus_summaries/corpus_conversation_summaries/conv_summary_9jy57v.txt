&gt;  but I chalked that up to her period, her eating disorder, latent sexual tension, or whatever

Do take this the wrong way, but I hope you never have to treat teenage girls if this is how you interpret a "female" not getting along with you.
Geez ...

You are obviously both in the wrong here.
Yes, what she did was kinda stupid, and probably at least somewhat motivated by her being irritated with you.
And she is that for good reasons.
Many places meant to be leased by two people have roommate agreements.
I myself had one when I did a year abroad in the US and its specifics was that noone could stay over for more than one night in a row or three nights total per week without agreement from the other roommate.
It's not clear from you description if "random dudes" had ever been a problem, or you were just anticipating?
In general, yes, it is an expected curtesy to tell the other roommate when/if you are bringing guests over.
And generally, other people should only be over when the roommate is also there.
(Some people, if their rommates agree, allow a little leeway there so that a partner can leave later than the roommate after staying the night).
Has that been a problem?
From your post it is not clear if there has been actual problems, or if this is "just" your personal wish of not having unknown guests over.
Because if the latter, yeah well, you can't live with roommates then.

Geez ...

scientists (and a psychotherapist is a scientist) has to consider all possible explanations for a phenomena regardless of whether they are politically correct or not.
what I listed as possible explanations for her behavior are statistically plausible, so therefore should not be ruled out.
that comment, by the way, was not relevant to the discussion or helpful to me personally.
Jebus, you're a piece of work.
This person also asked you questions about your roommate's boyfriend, what you meant, and whether it was actually a problem.
They're not out to get you.
You ignored the merest hint that you were outside your rights regarding guests, and any potential help to that situation.

It is relevant as it indicates that your behavior towards your roommate has been less than respectful.
If you want to use the label ‚Äúscientist‚Äù to try and explain your approach, know that it‚Äôs nothing more than a shallow excuse.
Thinking that your roommate acts a certain way because of her period/sexuality is just as disrespectful as her saying ‚Äúmy roommate is an socially incompetent asshole because he‚Äôs autistic‚Äù: both things are rooted in stereotypes and very disrespectful.
When people point out less than stellar things in your behavior it‚Äôs not automatically irrelevant.
It‚Äôs be good for you to take these things into consideration, because in the situation you‚Äôre describing both you and your roommate are in the wrong, and you‚Äôve both acted very poorly against each other.
He‚Äôs an autistic men‚Äôs rights activist.

Yea, I wonder if OP immediately jumps to "sexual tension, hormonal issues, midlife crises", etc whenever men in his life express emotion/disdain.
Or if he actually respects them as adult human beings, and it's just women that he treats with such biases.
Considering he posts to r/mensrights , I'm guessing the latter.
Do you have any interest in all in listening to other people or would you just like to be right?
&gt;You are wrong.
I'm not going to spend time elucidating your wrongness

Dude if this is how you respond to very very mild critisism then yeah, you're a bad scientist.
They broke no sub rules.
they gave you helpful feedback you could be using to better yourself.

Except the possibility that you might be socially impaired due to a condition known to cause social impairments.
QED, motherfucker.
