Original Response: 
&gt; But just what those 'Mad Max' supporters want to see from this new party on immigration policy appears to vary wildly from person to person.
And where Bernier chooses to draw that line could have major consequences for him, his new party and the broader political landscape in Canada.
I can't wait to see how this will play out.
Bernier may not be a racist or have racist policies, but he's attracting racists, bigots, and white nationalists.
They're going to ruin whatever efforts he makes to make Canada better or give conservatives another/better choice.
Which is already happening and it's hardly been a month since he broke ranks to create his own party, happening on the Facebook page:

&gt; Late Thursday night, a posting on Bernier's B.C.
Facebook group revealed the challenges he may face in attracting supporters he doesn't necessarily want.
&gt; One account whose avatar featured an old Norse symbol known as the valknut, often associated with white supremacists, posted a "Make Canada Great Again" meme with a picture of Bernier.
The same account also posted a screengrab of some of Bernier's tweets about "the cult of diversity" and added the comment "Yes Mr Bernier this cult must be destroyed."
&gt; "Already fake accounts are popping up covered in hate symbols," said another.
"If this group isn't banning racists flashing swaztikas and Valknuts, this is over before it has started.
CBC will eat Bernier [alive].
Ban this idiots Admins before they ruin any shot."
He will announce the party today.
Hopefully he's got enough metal to correctly give conservative Canadians another choice on election day while ensuring that hateful shits have no voice on his platform.
&gt;Bernier may not be a racist or have racist policies, but he's attracting racists, bigots,

Yeah but so what?
The LPC and the NDP has plenty of bigots and racists but that doesn't seem to hurt them.
Traditionally speaking, it's the right that breeds intolerance and bigotry.
I expected that Bernier would attract those shitheads and look, he has.
Last week he had the leader of some white nationalist group contact him.
Bernier denounced it, but the fact he was contacted by them is not remotely surprising.
These same people would never go to the NDP or LPC looking for a platform to align to because those parties don't have that stigma or reputation.
&gt;Bernier denounced it

Full stop.
And yes, the LPC and NDP are chalk-full of racists and bigots, they just don't think of themselves that way.
I find it hard to believe that white nationalist groups would ever contact the NDP or LPC.
Can you show me why you think that's the case, or point to equivalent hate groups that do?
What's scary is the left actually implements racist and sexist *policies* to advance their equality of outcome agenda.
It's more to protect minorities and groups that will be disadvantaged by majority rule.
So again, what hate groups reached out to the NDP or LPC?
I'm so curious, the only reason I align center and left is because the left doesn't engage in that, and doesn't attract those hateful groups that have no place in Canada, y'know like the right does.
The NDP and LPC are not full of white racists, they probably have some if you factor in likely statistical outliers, but they definitely harbour individuals that are racist against whites or other minorities because it provides them with preferential treatment.
Essentially the racists on the right play identity politics in favour of whites, while the racists on the left play it in favour of minorities or what ever group they're interested in pandering to.
The BCNDP has skin colour-based party policies that shut people out of even being able to run if they have the wrong colour skin.
Link please, googling for that turns up nothing.
That's advocating for groups not in the majority.
Those groups will need that support.
I see no reason why that's bad.
Why's that bad?
The conservative parties across Canada would do the same thing if they weren't already so heavily ingrained in the politics of intolerance.
I mean, you can't tolerate immigrants if your entire base doesn't want it.
So how can they appeal to immigrants?
They're a political party, if they could woo the immigrant and diversity vote like the left does, 100% the right would too.
But their supporters are largely hateful and intolerant so they cant, if they did, they wouldn't be an official party.
&gt;One account whose avatar featured an old Norse symbol known as the valknut, often associated with white supremacists

Every NDP group online has at least a few members flashing the hammer and sickle, often associated with the slaughter of hundreds of millions people worldwide.
But hey, who cares right?
Double standards are all the rage these days.
Hammer and sickle is also a symbol of socialism, which is pretty good for advocating for the less fortunate.
It's unfortunate that it is also associated with communism and Soviet Russia and Cuba and everything else you said.
but the difference is that there's no equivalency when it comes to the swastika.
It only denotes genocide and oppression and hate.

DIVERSITY MANDATE: Under the NDP’s diversity policy, the party’s byelection candidate must be a member of an “equity-seeking group.”

Equity-seeking groups are defined as: “Women, persons of colour, Aboriginal people, persons with disabilities, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, transsexual or intersex persons and young people between 18 and 25 years of age.”

In other words able-bodied, heterosexual, white men age 26 and older — like Leonard Krog, for example — will be banned from running.
&gt;That type of racism doesn't count!
[removed]
Yknow.
I think the Conservatives should totally retaliate and put up policies for white men age 26 and older — like Leonard Krog, for example.
That'll show em.
Edit: a word.
I prefer Bernier's philosophy of judging people by their actions and words instead their race, and treating all people equally under the law.
edit: BTW Leonard Krog is currently an NDP MLA, who isn't a fan of the racist policy.
“I have questioned the value of this party policy for a number of years,” he said.
“It has been the source of great consternation in several constituencies and led to some fights.”

His complaint about the policy?
It unfairly disqualifies people who might be great NDP candidates.
“No question about that,” he said.
“If you’re not allowing people to run based on their gender or other criteria, it rules out a significant number of people.”.

Minorities don't need any special treatment because they're minorities, I say that as a Pakistani born Canadian citizen.
It's actually quite racist of you to think that without extra support these minorities can't make it.
We shouldn't be pandering to immigrants or minorities based on them being immigrants or minorities, instead we should treat them for what they are, Canadians.
How about policy that is best for Canadians instead of policy that panders to specific groups.
&gt;It's more to protect minorities and groups that will be disadvantaged by majority rule.
it used to be about protection, now it's about advantage and power but you will never admit it.
&gt;So again, what hate groups reached out to the NDP or LPC?
Blacklives matter for 1 and plenty of regressive feminist groups during the Ghomeshi trial as just 2 examples.
I don't think it's got as much negative connotations compared to the swastika like I mentioned above.
The symbol is only synonymous with hate, nothing else.
Capitalism can get out of control though, I think it's the reason why housing markets in many Western cities is out of control, and why wages haven't really gone up.
It's really breeding a larger and larger wealth Gap each year.
Communists killed far more people in the last hundred years than the Nazis did, why are you defending them like they're "not so bad"
[deleted]
I admit it.
It's all about getting the most votes and staying in power, that's exactly how the NDP survives (appealing to the fringes of the left), and  any Liberals stay power.
The conservative parties across Canada would do the exact same thing, woo immigrants, if they didn't think their base would drop them like a rock.
Could you imagine if conservative parties across Canada adopted policies of diversity and inclusion?
It's a nice thought.
&gt; Blacklives matter for 1 and plenty of regressive feminist groups during the Ghomeshi trial as just 2 examples.
Oh please.
You're now really reaching.
Like **really** reaching.
BLM are a hate group that we haven't heard peep from in over a year.
And which political group paid them any mind when they were last relevant?
And feminists during the Ghomeshi trial?
They were completely irrelevant, he was acquitted on legal grounds.
Standards of living are fantastic in Canada.
Housing crisis and wage inequality notwithstanding, the standard of living in Canada is fantastic and I think I may (and maybe many other Canadians) need to temper our expectations slightly to these two realities.
I'm not defending them, are you defending Nazis?
I'm saying that Nazis are worse.
Agree to disagree?
Isnt this illegal since it is discrimination?
As a Jew I cannot agree more.
Nothing is more patronising than someone thinking a person can't make it on their own because they are a minority.
It's racism in sheep's clothing.
&gt;Could you imagine if conservative parties across Canada adopted policies of diversity and inclusion?
Would "policies of inclusion" include the NDP policy that excludes people based on their gender, race and age?
&gt; Hammer and sickle is also a symbol of socialism, **which is pretty good for advocating for the less fortunate.
** It's unfortunate that it is also associated with communism and Soviet Russia and Cuba and everything else you said.
There are plenty of better ways to advocate for the less fortunate than using symbolism associated with mass genocide, horrifying living conditions and monstrous dictators.
Let's also mention their coddling of TERFS and defense of queerphobic cultures and religious groups.
No, unfortunately our Charter has a section that makes discrimination legal if it's well intentioned.
Canada for hundreds of years has dealt with a minority groups remarkably well and only on our bad days does racism rear it's ugly head against minorities.
This country has integrated Ukrainians despite there being hysteria 100 years ago that they wouldn't fit in, we integrated Scandanavians, Irish, Greek, Chinese, we accepted black slaves when they were in trouble, and many others over the past century and a half.
We aren't perfect, but we did all of it without thinking that the majority somehow ruled over minorities.
The Canada I know connects people on a level deeper than skin colour, ethnicity, and religion.
To use such things as a basis to design policies is shallow and the product of someone who can't seem to see others beyond skin-deep parameters.
What section is that?
The Communists in China and the Soviet Union each killed more of their citizens than the Nazis.
I don't know how you can say that's worse than the Nazis.
The second part of section 15

&gt;15 (1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
&gt;(2) Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
&gt;Could you imagine if conservative parties across Canada adopted policies of diversity and inclusion?
It's a nice thought.
That's rich.
Look at the recent election in Ontario.
East Asians, Indians, Eastern Europeans, and immigrants in general voted PC more than any other demographic.
Steve Paikin did a special on it a few months back.
The party must be so uninclusive... Stop drinking the Kool Aid.
Do you think that is fair?
I dont really agree with that.
Nazis are worse Because it's been shown widely the world over, for the right it's very difficult to denounce Nazis but it's easy for the left to denounce communists.
Hell, you're doing it right now, you are still defending Nazis by simply not denouncing them.
Obama was right in asking, "what is so hard about saying Nazis are bad?"
And that's what makes them so dangerous, the right leans on freedom of speech to defend them.
It's not about freedom of speech when they've proven in history and today that they are not to be trusted with any platform.
Oooh link that special please, I wanna see.
Easy for the left to denounce Communists?
You're defending them right now even though they are up with with the Mongol empire in terms of people they murdered!
No, I'm not a fan of it.
But to play devil's advocate, there are some cases for allowing that kind of discrimination that I do support, such as having women-only shelters available.
I wonder if theres a middle ground.

Stats around 0:49.
You can't win an election in Canada without the "minority" vote.
This whole discussion about minorities is particularly meaningless in Toronto where virtually everyone is either a visual minority, an immigrant, both of those two things, 1st or 2nd generation of immigrants and/or visual minority, a mix between two different ethnicities, has a religion that is not Christian, or from some far away part of Canada.
This is increasingly the case in all cosmopolitan places in Canada, making us by far the most successful immigrant country on Earth.
Even Winnipeg has joined the fun!
If only we could find a way to translate common sense into legalese.
I'm not defending communists, doggie.
I've said it twice now.
It's pretty easy, I'll say it a third time: communists suck dick, they're bad, I'm not defending them.
I didn't even bring them up in the first place, you did in order to deflect from me denouncing Nazis and swastikas.
BTW, you still haven't denounced them, and continue whataboutism.
Thanks for the link, I'll watch it when I get to the office.
Have it that you can only discriminate for very specific things such as shelters.
Programs etc is too broad.
Enjoy.
My family are immigrants and the way the speak in the video is similar to some of my family.
People from across the world appear to rise above their differences and join a political party together as Canadians *without* silly policies and have a vision for the future.
Unfortunately I disagree with the PCs on many economic issues.
Here I'll make it easy for you.
Communism and Nazis were both the worst monsters in human history since the Mongol empire and im glad they are both confined to the ash heap of history.
Now can you admit that the Communists killed 20 million of their own citizens in both China and Russia and admit that's kinda a big deal?
[deleted]
*mettle.
Totally, thanks for that.
I really wish Canada would speak up against China considering what they're doing to their religious groups, especially the [Muslim Uighurs](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45147972)
&gt; The LPC and the NDP has plenty of bigots and racists but that doesn't seem to hurt them.
Probably because both of them go out of their way to, at least, publicly state that racism and bigotry are bad rather than pussy-footing around it when they're confronted with it.
In fairness, Bernier *has* disavowed support from at least one white nationalist group, so he's on the right track.
It's a shame that the CPC couldn't grow the balls to do the same.
I dont truly see women only shelters as discriminatory because regular shelters become de facto male 99% of the time.
Yes, women can technically go there, if theyre fine with violence and rape.
But I get your point.
The conclusion I make is that black and white solutions to problems dont exist, and we are currently in an epidemic where people think they do.
Communism gets a less bad wrap than Nazism because the Nazis were racist white supremacists who put themselves on top of everyone else .
Under Communism, for the most part, everyone was equally worthless and expendable lol.
The Hammer and Sickle killed indiscriminately when it came to race, gender, ability, if you were against the cause you were bad.
Nazis had a shitty racial heiarchy where they put themselves on the top and everyone beneath them was garbage.
In communism, everyone was garbage, so technically, it was more equal.
&gt;The conclusion I make is that black and white solutions to problems dont exist, and we are currently in an epidemic where people think they do.
Really good point.
I'm hoping Bernier can bring some of that kind of reasonability back to Canadian politics.
[deleted]
I plan to vote in his direction myself.
Which is weird because several years ago I was far left.
Im not defending communism, but the over arching goal of it seems to be bringing everyone down to 0, to make everyone equally worthless.
Nazis , right out say they are better than me and I dont deserve to live as much as they do.
Fuck I hate what-about-ism.
This is a horrible argument to make lol.
Amen (in a completely atheist way of course).
Just to be clear, I don't advocate for Communism or Marxism.
Your argument is if someone likes the idea of communism, that means they agree with killing on a mass scale?
That's a specious argument and you know it.
Communism doesn't advocate for killing on that scale, however it's inherant weakness as a system  makes it so that power is easilly abused by people like Stalin and the like.
Whereas White Supremacy and Neo Nazi ideals actively call directly for things like a White Ethno State or Genocide.
You tell me which is worse?
None of the parties support racism, it's 2018 nobody should have to go completely out of their way to denounce it - the only reason for doing so is because people on the left are so hellbent in labelling everyone a racist who doesn't agree with their worldview.
Racism is not an issue and does not warrant even a fraction of the time we spend talking about it as a country, but yet it has increasingly become the **only** topic the left is concerned about.
but will you ever admit you were wrong, that's the real question.
What?
Communist has no place in the NDP.
It's a big tend party for social democrats (the majority), democratic socialists (The parties roots) and socialists (small minority).
Do you have any links to share?
I'm sure a lot of people would be outraged if your claims were true.
&gt;Oh please.
You're now really reaching.
Like really reaching.
BLM was started by a woman who is racist as fuck and plenty of feminist groups tried to pressure the government into essentially making an accused prove his/her innocense and essentially half succeeded in that effort.
How is any of that "reaching" you asked for examples and I responded quickly with 2 concrete examples which you are now trying to just dismiss as if you are under no obligation whatsoever to put any work into defending your view.
No, that's not his argument in the slightest.
He points out that the NDP has blatantly racist policies, and your response is to suggest that the Conservatives should *also* impose racist policies?
Your party is openly racist, dude.
Accept it.
Whataboutism.
Whataboutism.
facts.
When your criticism of a group is that they're "bigots" "racists" and "white nationalists" (and probably some muttered under the breath accusations of 'alt-right' and 'nazi's), it is absolutely fair game to point out that your own shit doesn't stink.
So those particular NDP supports are peace's of shit too?
What's so hard to comprehend about that.
That's the definition of whataboutism.
Sidestep criticism by pointing out someone else's faults and going "Well what about them!"
The left is obsessed with race, they can’t let it go.
It’s all they see is the color of people’s skin.
No, saying "you are just as guilty of this as you accuse others of being" isn't whataboutism; it's pointing out hypocrisy.
How the hell is this whataboutism?
A party isn't defined by what some idiots comment on a Facebook page.
For starters, people that post on Facebook pages are stupid, extremely small minority of a parties followers.
Next, people that post about politics on Facebook are in about 10% of the people that post anything on Facebook.
On top of that, the people with swastikas, runes, anime profile pictures, h&amp;s, papa joe, or Ayn rand profile pictures are only about 10% of those idiots.
So you're trying to say that max's party is defined by the meth head Facebook user that posts garbage, but the ndp isn't defined by the latte sipping, Gucci wearing, neutral milk hotel listening, pseudostalinist?
It's not whataboutism because it's not forgiving the morons that post on either page, it's pointing out the hypocrisy of saying that because a Nazi posts something on max's page, max is a Nazi, but when someone does the same with communist shit on Singh's page, it's totally different.
The new NDP led by a privileged racist bigot is circling the drain.
Shhh it's their only argument lol.
Funny that in 2018 it's completely acceptable to ask if someone is a minority or a female in an online job application.
Affirmative action is a left/ liberal idea and it's just another way of discriminating and categorizing people.
Both are huge pieces of shit imo.
Hopefully you agree with that, otherwise...
Jessus christ, what is this r/latestagecapitalism comment.
Get outta here.Socialism is a failure of an ideology that has directly resulted in the deaths of the same people they were trying to help.
20 million in China?
That's an extremely lowball estimate.
AT LEAST, very conservative estimates say 45-50 million DIED AT LEAST in the Great Leap Forward.
I'm not even white lmfao, but you are an extremely ignorant person if you think white people are the only people who are racist lmfao.
There are racists on the LPC, and NDP.
&gt; That's advocating for groups not in the majority

As a non-white citizen of Canada born to immigrants, that's bullshit.
"We" the minority don't need preferential treatment, that helps no one.
Yeah!
just look at those hellholes Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Finland and Ireland.
All burnt to the ground once they became social democrat welfare states.
The swastica is a symbol of good luck in east asia and in germany represented recycling animal rights and many other things its a symbol of alot of good things!
/s.
All have some of the worlds most open markets.
They are not socialist.
Literally none of them.
You seem to confuse "free" healthcare and secondary education with socialism, just that.
They are open markets,
These are capitalist democracies with a strong safety net.
Not unlike Canada.
Or the USA, for that matter.
The US does have a strong safety net for the bottom 25 %, much as the world likes to pretend otherwise.

Hey Maxime Bernier's new party may have an issue with white supremacists.
Well what about the NDP:  They have communists.
This is the textbook definition of what-about-ism.
