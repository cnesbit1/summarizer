Original Response: 
I keep forgetting how loaded the leafs are up front .
Like I knew they were strong, but literally any one of their top 6 could arguably a 1st line player on most other teams.
Fucking hate the leafs.
😘😘😘.
Not sure if you're being sarcastic but I dunno, just cause a player gets 1st line time doesn't make them a first liner.
A first liner is a guy that can drive the offence and Marleau can't do it anymore, Hyman is a complimentary player and Nylander isn't there yet.
They definitely have a great top 6, but it's not god like and it's not even the best in the league IMO.
I cant name more than 3 other teams that have as good or better top 6 than the Leafs.
Tampa, Winnipeg and maybe Washington?
Pittsburgh?
Crosby/Malkin are better than any Leafs player.
However, as top 6 goes, the Leafs have a better “group.”.
That's very debatable.
I'd probably take:

Crosby, Malkin, Kessel, Hornquvist, Guentzel, Brassard

over

Matthews, Tavares, Marner, Nylander, Kadri, Marleau

But a case could be made either way.
Yeah even as a Leafs fan it’s hard to argue in favor of the Leafs.
Crosby and Malkin definitely help tilt things in favor of Pits.
If anything, I think it speaks to how great both teams top 6 are.
I disagree about Nylander.
Also, you have to take into account that a really good top 6 player (Kadri) is playing on the third line.
&gt;If anything, I think it speaks to how great both teams top 6 are.
For sure.
There's good argument's for both.
Probably comes down to who stays healthy and who gets hot this season.
Tavares, Matthews, and Marner would be first liners on pretty well every team, or they're playing a 1a/1b role with the same minutes and equal PP time.
Nylander, Kadri and Marleau are 1st liners on most teams, and top end 2nd liners are some others.
I think yeah this season Pittsburgh might be better (overall, I think in terms of scoring the Leafs top 7 is better but 🤷) but for the future and building a franchise I'd def take the Leafs rn.

Summary: 
Crosby/Malkin are better than any Leafs player.
However, as top 6 goes, the Leafs have a better “group.”.
If anything, I think it speaks to how great both teams top 6 are.
