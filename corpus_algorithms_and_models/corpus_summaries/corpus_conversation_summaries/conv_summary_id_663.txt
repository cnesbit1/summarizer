Hey everyone.
I am building my home here in corpus and have a dome in the center hallway.
I want to hire someone to paint a mural on it.
Anyone here know someone?
Or is one?
Thanks.
Try A&amp;M, they have a good art department and a few people may be willing to do it for the experience.
You should look up the muralist, Crystal Goodman.
She is a relatively local artist and her work is all around Texas.
Very creative and reasonable funding.
Also does work for habitat for humanity as well.
Exceptional lady.
crystalgoodman.com is her website I believe.
Just curious, what did you want a mural of?
Painting on a dome is a bit harder than painting on a flat wall, IMHO.
A blue sky with clouds and maybe birds.
we would like it to look realistic.
