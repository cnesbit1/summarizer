Original Response: 
I'll start by saying I have a wife and two kids, and I live really far away from my mom and dad.
It's been a few years since I've seen them before today, and so last month my wife made a suggestion that we take a trip down to their house for a surprise visit, which is about 3,000 miles away (we all live in the united states.)
I was all for the idea, so we planned accordingly.
Fast forward about 30 days and finally, we arrived yesterday night at a friends house 20 minutes from my parent's house.
At this point they still didn't know we were in their home state.
We had our friend text my parents that night to ask them if they could drive down to a restaurant next to their house at 8 o'clock in the morning to meet up with him for breakfast, and they agreed.
By the way, he made sure not to mention us in the text.
*So from my parent's point of view, a family friend asked them to meet up for breakfast, and my parents were like, "sure.
"*

So my friend, my wife and I all go to the restaurant as soon as it opened while my friends wife watched our kids, because they were still sleeping.
We were planning on staying an entire week anyway so we figured if the kids could see their grandparents after the surprise breakfast, it would be fine.
We were at the restaurant for an hour when my parents finally showed up (on time).
My wife and I were excited as we've put allot of time and money into this, so we jumped out of our chairs when we saw them walking in.
My mom started crying and my dad looked happier than ever.
We all caught up while eating breakfast and everything was flowing smoothly.
That is, until the check came.
My wife and I planned on paying, but then my parents insisted on it.
With my dad being Italian, he was very stern and insisted he would pay for the breakfast.
My wife told me to let them take care of it, but I wouldn't back down.
This dragged on for what seemed like an eternity, and my wife and I got into a miniature argument about it.
Everyone was talking and there was allot of tension throughout our table.
I heard my dad make a serious-toned comment saying "You two should have never got married."
I looked at him and stood up from the table, and said "What the F*ck?
Come on!
We are trying to get along here!"
I felt like I was a teenager back at home and under my parent's control.
Anyway, he stood up and threatened to fight me so I immediately punched him in the dick.
He dropped.
I don't remember what exactly happened after that, but my friend drove me and my wife back to their house.
Since then I've cooled down, realized I made a huge mistake, and have been trying reaching out to my parents in several ways.
They will not respond to me.
I don't even know why I punched him there, but it didn't feel inappropriate at the time because I have been practicing Krav Maga for a few months now.
I feel super bad and wish I could turn back time.
I can't help but think that in my parent's world, their son from across the country all of a sudden showed up to their hometown and pretty much immediately punched dad in the dick.
I can't even believe I am writing this post on reddit right now.
**tldr**: TIFU by punching my dad in the dick for threatening to fight me after surprising him in a restaurant.
Sounds like there is a lot of unresolved issues from when you were a teen.
It actually sounds like this would stem back from between conception and somewhere between 9 and 13 years old.
You mentioned that you felt like your dad had all the power and was controlling you.
Did that happen often growing up?
What were things like in your childhood home?
Its entirely possible you picked up on -or rebelled against- some of the ways your parents behaved.
Everyone will have experienced a traumatic experience as a child, maybe you and your mom had to wait for your dad to take the first bite before you could start eating and because of that you started to feel small.
This is a bit deep for Reddit; so, I ask you to PM me - don't feel pressured to do so.
I may have some insight - as I, along with many others, have had a similar experience- and I have a program that you can look into which will not only provide you with some closure, but also compassion and forgiveness for you and everyone else.
You are not your parents.
If you don't message me, just keep this in the back of your mind.
Not everything is a traumatic experience.
