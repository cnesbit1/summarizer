I never knew how beautiful she was.
you must have been living under a rock.
Yes, a very big one.
I think it's because she finally grew out of that chubby baby looking face.
Edit:haha someone downvoted everyone.
Yep.
(Note: I only know this because of public knowledge) After she went through the chemo treatment for lupus, I remember seeing the post pics and felt bad for her.
She blew up because of the steroids that she was taking to counter act the chemo drugs.
She then kind of disappeared for a while there and when she came back into the public eye, she lost that little girl image and looked more grown up.
She isn't a bad singer either if I don't say so myself.
