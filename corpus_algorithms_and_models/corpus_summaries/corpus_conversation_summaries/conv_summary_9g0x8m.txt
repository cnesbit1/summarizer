[shiny]

Primarily looking for RareBall and ApriBall Gen I Pokemon.
GenI Shinies also.
I prefer hatched vs caught.
Open to other offers too.
Here is what I have to offer.

I'm interested in any of your shinies besides yanma, scyther, minior, and the two rockruffs.
How many per Shiny?
If you want them with gold bottle caps then 2 per shiny, otherwise 4 per shiny (5 if you dont care about ivs)
I care about HA more than anything.
No bottle caps.
Those done help me in breeding.
And I've done 12 per Shiny before.
Alright, i can breed 12 per shiny, itll take a while though.
Could i have amaura in exchange?
Sorry.
I should have checked before.
I'm kind of distracted being on solo parent duty this weekend.
I have all but 7 of those.
Beast Eevee, Dream Bulbasaur/Eevee/Lapras, Love Charmander, Lure Squirtle, and Fast Paras.
I can venture outside of Gen I for the other 5.
Level and Lure balls are my smallest collections so you are least likely to have something overlapping there.
Also, for Apri/RareMon I'm only offering the 4IV Shinies right now.
EDIT: I also don't care a ton about IVs so if you are breeding with two "good" parents, I'm fine with the first HA that pops out.
On hands are acceptable too.
No worries!!
Here is a list of most of my rareball breedables: 

- lure HA squirtle (4EM)

Ok. Add these to the list.
* Lure Froakie
* Lure Totodile
* Level Fennekin
* Love Murkrow
* Love Oshawott

No real rush.
Just let me know when you are done.
I've scratched the Popplio off the list for you.
All right, I'll let you know.
Just a heads up, it may take a few weeks (I'm a busy student)
Ok.
I understand.
Let's say end of the month then.
Are you ok with that?
I'll reserve the Popplio that long and keep the list of Aprimon so I don't get duplicates from someone else.
I'll try my best.
Ok. Just touch base with me at the end of the month.
Sounds good.
Hey I just finished breeding all 12 of them (Surprised it was this fast lol)!
You're in luck because most of them have 4+ IVs :)

Lmk when you have time to trade, i just added your FC
Btw if its not too much trouble then could you nickname it Azure for me?
Ok.
I should have time in 4-5 hours.
Alright and thanks, I should be available then.
I can trade now.
Alright, I'll go online.
Ok.
In the Plaza now.
Request when you are on.
Thanks for the trade!
!
Thank you also.
Those were all Sportball Caterpie eggs.
Of you can check ESV, you might get lucky and find a match on r/SVExchange.
I didn't check those because they didn't end up with Competitive IVs.
Thank you for the info!
I didn't even know there was a svexchange subreddit, I'll check it out :) enjoy your mons!

Summary: 
I should have checked before.
I have all but 7 of those.
I care about HA more than anything.
Here is what I have to offer.
Alright and thanks, I should be available then.
Are you ok with that?
Ok. Add these to the list.
