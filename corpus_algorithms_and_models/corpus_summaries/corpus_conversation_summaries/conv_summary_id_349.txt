That's rad, I wonder if he vogues too.
He lives in flour bluff.
I see him all the time with different pairs on.
He was mentioned on the radio and facebook 2 years ago.
He says he is doing it out of respect for women or he is going to write a book about it, but we all know he is just weird.
I call him heels.
Lovely little town.
They call him "Heel Neal" around my neighbourhood.
"He lives in flour bluff"I think that goes without saying.
Of course.
I've chatted with him before at the store after he complimented my heels.
He's a very nice guy and had no issue talking and laughing a bit about his struggles to find cute heels for a men's size 11-12 (forgot what he said his women's size is.)
I didn't bother to really ask "why?"
because I don't really care.
I just love watching the apprehension and confusion he causes by simply choosing to wear men's business casual on top and women's footwear on bottom.
IIRC he has a solid "normal" job and a wife.
He's just doing his thang.

Summary: 
He's just doing his thang.
He lives in flour bluff.
