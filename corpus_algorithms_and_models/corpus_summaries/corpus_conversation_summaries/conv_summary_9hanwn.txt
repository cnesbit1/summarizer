false.
the decision to bring the 1 million jobs to the U.S. was announced before Trump was inaugurated.
But Trump's severely-criticized tariffs and trade wars have made that impossible.
Because of Trump's insane tariffs and trade wars, the
U.S, is losing jobs at an unprecedented rate.
Do you know Jack Ma?
&amp;#x200B;

He said many stuff but he act differently.
&amp;#x200B;

He said he would go philanthropy, but to avoid tax, he set up trust in Singapore and transfer 20+ billions worth of share tax free to tax heaven.
&amp;#x200B;

He said he don't like fame, but he made himself a movie as hero that defeat all famous stars.
&amp;#x200B;

He said if country need it, he will give the Alipay to the country.
&amp;#x200B;

He also said he will retire next year and do better than bill gates.

US job loss mainly due to job transfer to oversea with cheaper labour cost.
But since Tariff, investment and job start to flow back to US.
Jack Ma 1 Million jobs are never there in US and will never happened.
How would Jack Ma have the capabilities of creating 1 Millions job while the whole Alibaba only have 66000 employees?
May be his idea is to get rid of all US productions and ship stuff all from China, creating 1M of delivery boys/girls.
If it was announced that must mean it was definitely gonna happen.
yes, you're right.
I'm sorry you're having difficulty with your English.
Mate, some people aren't native speakers.
Don't be a dick.
Go ahead bud, try sounding it out first.
Yes, thats why standards of living has been in an all time high since China stole all those jobs.
China does the goods, the US designs and sells them, idiot.
Thats why there has been an increase in white collar jobs and in the service industry.
Not to mention that China manufactures globally, even if americans are willing to buy a 3k iphone,  there is no way that US can compete with european and asian companies that manufacture in China.
How does it feel knowing that Elizabeth Warren will never ever be president?
Tell me what kind of tariffs would be involved here.
Alibaba is a storefront, do they actually produce anything?
If you own a vending machine that sells almost nothing but soda, and suddenly there's a soda tax, fewer customers will buy soda and that means fewer customers will use your vending machine.
So you make less money even though you don't actually produce anything.
What is your native language, if you don't mind my asking?
Are we winning yet?
it takes time for the horrible consequences of these horrible policies to show up, but they will before the 2020 election.

&gt; However a majority have used it to create record breaking stock buybacks on margin and enrich themselves.
Right, and we all knew that was what would happen, because we've seen it play out multiple times over the last 30-40 years.
Every time there's a big tax break, the GOP promises one thing and reality turns out to be completely different.

Apple is one of the big companies that were explicltly exempted from most of these tariffs, so your theory doesn't really hold up: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/18/apples-tim-cook-says-its-not-really-great-to-tariff-apple-products.html

The tariffs have nothing to do with intentionally punishing American companies, Trump just wants to punish China because he doesn't understand how trade deficits work, and if Americans are harmed in the process he doesn't really care.
Anyway, all that being said, businesses using the excess cash for stock buybacks is the logical thing to do, so you can't really blame them.
It doesn't make sense for a company to hire a bunch of extra workers if there's not enough demand to justify doing so.
It's not like these companies were strapped for cash prior to the tax bill, anyway, so if there was anything to be gained from hiring more people they would have done it already.
So the only logical thing to do with the extra cash, for most companies, is to use it for stock buybacks.

&gt; Apple is one of the big companies that were explicltly exempted from most of these tariffs, so your theory doesn't really hold up:

The article says SOME not ALL apple products are exempt.
Your statements are false.
You didn't read the article, per usual.
&gt;Trump just wants to punish China because he doesn't understand how trade deficits work,

As an nearly 75 /yo international businessman, he knows he knowns how international business works.
Maybe, actually you don't or something.
&gt; and if Americans are harmed in the process he doesn't really care.
That last statement was just an unfounded personal attack.
Are you not doing better now than the year before?
Thank Trump and American leadership who understand protectionism as an economic model protecting us from unfair competition, so a "communist" country can continue to carry out human rights violations, cyber attacks, imperialism, and destroys the earth so you could have a cheap goods you toss in the trash a year from now.
Chinese products are bad for the planet.
American products made in china have no environmental regulations for manufacturing, AND no labor laws.
You are selfish and heartless.

Summary: 
That was never going to happen, tariffs or no tariffs.
Are you not doing better now than the year before?

China does the goods, the US designs and sells them, idiot.
