Hello!
I'm looking for a lot of aprimons.
Of specific interest are the ones marked in pink on the [Special Balls tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hg_WT4lif9HjPLpXVwPDTK5oth-FOiS9GIANF8wmBfY/edit#gid=1445398424) of my spreadsheet.
And there is a lot of pink on my spreadsheet (although you might have to scroll down a ways to see the bulk of it).
For trade, I have over 50 NA Tornadus/Thundurus codes.
I am looking to trade each code for 3 aprimons.
HA is preferred, but not necessary (except for genderless, male-only or female-only species, in which case I only want it if it has HA, since I cannot simply breed the HA on later).
I have a heavy ball Pancham, Level ball Larvesta, and Moon ball Orangru.
I can trade you, but only Pancham has a HA.
That's fine.
Let me know what is a good time for you to trade.
I will be available to trade for most of the next 2 hours, and also later today.
I am free to trade now if you can.
If not let me know when you are free.
I should be free for a while.
I can’t trade now, but I’ll probably get home in about 3 hours, after which I’ll be available for the rest of the day.
Sounds good.
Let me know when you are ready to do the trade.
I can trade, now.
I'll add your FC and get a few junkmons ready.
Let me know when to head to FP.
Is it alright with you if I send you the code~~s~~ by PM at the same time as you are trading me the aprimons in FP?
Yea, that's fine.
I'll head on soon.
Okay, I'll be in FP.
Code sent.
Thanks for the trade!
Thanks to you, too!

Summary: 
I should be free for a while.
I am free to trade now if you can.
I can trade you, but only Pancham has a HA.
Let me know when you are ready to do the trade.
