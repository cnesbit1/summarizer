Original Response: 
It's kinda trivial but I thought it was pretty cool when I noticed you  can see Krakatorrik through the rifts that appear in jahai bluffs!

The amount of detail Arenanet put into this episode...
I can't.
Except with the economy amirite.
Even just all the new ambient dialogue its quite impressive.

this was a very detailed episode and itâ€™s sad that we rarely get thought put into the little things.
I just wish I wouldn't hear a specific dialogue across the entire map.
I'm sure everyone in the LS department is chewing THAT GUY out rn bc they had finally made an episode the community seemed to collectively love but he HAD to fuck it all up.
"Thank you for the help Commander!"
But I didn't even participate in the event....
*gasp* Antiquities!
You mean the "Time is running short, we have to move"-thing?
I wondered where it's coming from, I can't seem to find the source.
Nah I meant the one the other two wrote about the "Antiquties" one.
The one you mean is part of the Shatterer I think, not sure though.
Oh man this dialogue is so irritating.
I was DOING shatterer and the asura goes off talking about antiquities I'm like...girl shouldn't you be fighting rn or something??
Then I hear her across the map in the Argon Garrison and I'm genuinely confused, where is she even located at?
