She has a gorgeous armpit.
Seeing only 1 comment, I thought "nah, there's no way it's about the armpit."
Clicked anyway... good job!
That's a pretty bad photo.
Emma looks great, squint aside, but the vinyl floor is filthy, and very poorly lit, along with the backdrop.
I'm interested to know what photographer did that to her.Edit: Actually, with her playing with the hair clip, and squinting at the camera, I'm wondering if it might be a shot taken between proper shooting.
It looks unedited.
I've just had a go in Lightroom, and can be hugely improved with minimal lighting adjustments.
It could very well be an outtake...
That's what I was thinking.
