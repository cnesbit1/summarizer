This is animal abuse!
I am gonna call AVA, MOM, PAP, ARCA AND LHL.

This animal *should* have been **STEAMED** till **white** and drizzled with a light soy sauce.
Aka the iconic **WHITE CHICKEN RICE** then served with fragrant oily rice with a small helping chili.
Drowning the chicken in dark soy sauce is *typical low SES* behavior.
ðŸ™„ A crime against humanity has truly occurred.
Canâ€™t wait for you all to be arrested by PUB AND THE POLICE.
Singapore Supreme Court will most definitely put you away for a long long time, longer than kid rapists and murderers.
SMALL HELPING CHILI MY ASS THE MORE THE MERRIER
also where got drown in dark sauce.
If you canâ€™t tell thatâ€™s literally swimming in disgusting black sauce, then we are truly lost.
The chicken died for nothing!

Can't rmb the name of the sauce but it deffo isn't dark soya sauce which is even darker and thick.
Lol white chicken isn't even steamed.
Is poached.
It is actually dark sauce.
Tiger brand premium dark sauce is thick like that.
There's also cooking caramel which is cheaper and you can blend with cheaper dark sauce to have a similar result.
Ok here Iâ€™ll let you all sleep peacefully tonight.
Itâ€™s not dark soy sauce, itâ€™s actually a secret sauce that this stall provides which is really smooth and runny and really good like itâ€™s prob on all chicken rice but this isnâ€™t those thick soya sauce which tastes like shit.
I also donâ€™t understand those who drown it all in that.
I only eat roasted chicken rice with dark soy sauce, no chilli.
:(
So was he right?
If he was my bad, sorry for misunderstanding.
He was right that it was dark sauce, but he's wrong about dark sauce in chicken rice being disgusting.
But yea give the tiger brand premium dark soy sauce (greenish yellow label) a try.
Goes great with half boiled eggs.
Slightly sweet, thick, not salty.
Funny thing is, tiger brand does a chicken rice dark sauce and bah kut teh dark sauce.
The exact same thing!
Good marketing.
EDIT: 

Actually, looking at the picture, theres no dark sauce in there.
So he's wrong.
That's just the chicken rice dressing sauce.
Its light soy sauce with sugar, fish sauce and some people put a hint of oyster sauce.
I died at ACRA hahahahaha.
Eyyy I thought so thanks for clarifying.
Sorry ah my bad.
