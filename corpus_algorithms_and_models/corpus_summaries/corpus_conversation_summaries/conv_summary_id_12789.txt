Who goes snorkeling with their fedora?
I agree with you, I couldn't live without my fedora, so I had it surgically attached to my skull.
The downside is I can't tip my fedora at m'ladys, but it still woos them ^/s.
Having it surgically attached to your skull was the best decision in your life.
Idk your other life decisions but I'm certain that's #1.
Otherwise you would be like Jessica Alba having to grab your snorkeling gear after your fedora fell off.
It is common knowledge that a fedora doubles your IQ when worn.
Now she just looks like a complete idiot with snorkeling gear to find her floating fedora.
She doesn't even realize that the snorkeling gear goes on her face not her arm.
Hopefully craniofedorotomy is covered by Obamacare so the rest of us can be saved from such humiliation.
I thought I was alone in thinking this ^/s.
