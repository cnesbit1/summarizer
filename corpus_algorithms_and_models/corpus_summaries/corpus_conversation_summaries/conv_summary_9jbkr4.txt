Original Response: 
What interest rates?
I’m still getting zero pretty much.
The ones banks get.
Not you duh.
So they decided there will never be interests on savings again?
Sweet.
I figured I'd go and actually see what my savings account is doing lately.
Pretty much zero is accurate.
It is something in the neighborhood of .2% annually.
I didn't bother getting too precise because "zero pretty much" is close enough.
Most large banks are still keeping the interest rates they pay on savings accounts very low.
However, other banks, especially online ones have been drastically raising rates over the past couple of years.
[This](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/best-high-yield-online-savings-accounts/) is a good place to start.
Gs bank gives 1.75%.
Prob gonna go up to 2 after this.
It’s something.
edit - it's 1.9 as of this morning.
From the bank's perspective, they will keep savings as low as they can get away with.
That money is "free" to them which massively inflates their net interest margin.
They will only adjust when a significant portion of their customer base starts moving their money out of savings and into better yielding instruments.
If you have more than 4-6 months of bills worth of funds in a standard savings account, you should be looking to move it somewhere safe-ish that will at least keep up with inflation.
Good if you’re in the US ;(
Granted the link might have been US focused, but searching "high interest savings account" + &lt;country&gt; is trivial, and there should be options in most developed nations.
Move to a credit union like Alliant.
I get 1.8% on my savings.
The advantage as EU citizen are extremely low interest rates on money you lend.
Some banks even offer negative interest rates on smaller loans.
Hardly makes a difference unless you have $50k+ and if you do keeping that all in an open savings is cutting yourself short.

You can buy 4 week US treasury bills through virtually any securities broker in the US (for free at no commission -- they make it up via sec lending).
The min denomination is $100 _and_ the interest is state tax free.
The 1.9% that Marcus is giving me on my emergency fund is way better than the 0.1% my credit union offers.
$50k is not a requirement for a high interest savings account to be a good decision.
.1 is extremely low.
But you're right 50k was a high number.
At 0.5% 10k will get you approximately $4.10/mo in interest.
At 2% that's $16.40/mo.
Neither keep up with inflation and $12 more a month isn't exciting.
You should look into other options for investing than a safe savings account.
Yes for you 3 month emergency fund it's fine.
My credit union, UW Credit Union, has .03% interest on savings accounts

https://www.uwcu.org/rates/save-invest/
Well the post does talk about the Fed rate...
This is a great tip.
Any excess money I have that I need to put away for a short period I put in T bills instead of a savings account.
It's useful now that rates are going up.
Also, depending on the size of the cash pile you have, you could also ladder, creating a stream of payments with longer dated maturities.
Go to Argentina.
They have almost 20% interest on investments.
My 6 month emergency fund is $24K.
That means that I get $432 annually versus $24 that I would earn for a standard 0.1% interest account.
Why would I turn down a free $400?
That's ignoring the other benefits I get with my bank.
You wouldn't.
0.1% is rediculously low.
I'm just saying 1.9% hardly keeps up with inflation.
If you have 24k in that but have a hundred thousand elsewhere in better investments it's fine.
But to throw all your cash in just an open savings is a sure way to not make money.
All the major banks (eg Bank of America) are currently at 0.01% interest on their savings rate, so 0.1% in comparison is actually generous.
Other than that, you're right.
Other than an emergency fund, you shouldn't have any money in your savings account.
https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-savings-account-interest-rates

I'm just saying that I'm not going to turn down free money, no matter how small the amount.
There's no downside in my online credit union, and I make an extra $400 per year.
What a horrendous rate!
I'm in Canada so I understand it's different but still we can get 1% at a minimum at any brick and mortar bank.
$HYT.
it'll only get worse 

this is still cheap interest rate, it used to be 15% 

so if you want to get a house, now is probably the best time to buy so you can lock in a cheaper interest rate.
The market is headed for a correction in the next 18 months to two years.
Prices are high right now, it's a terrible time to buy.
It's a great time to sell, however.
edit: how do you do the remind me thing lol.
I always heard in school that house prices are interesting because most people look at the equation as what can I afford on a monthly basis.
The theory behind that being a gradual tick in interest rates would simply depress some of the long term increases in housing prices as more of a buyer’s monthly payment will now go to mortgage costs as opposed to principal.
It’ll be interesting to see how housing prices react in a period of steady, anticipated rate increases.
It was 18 for a couple months one time.
It has averaged 5-7% throughout most of the last century.
People have been saying that for 5 years now.
Agreed.
Realestate tax increases in Illinois has made most suburban property values remain stagnant for the last 10-15 years.
At peak market... no thanks.
Has the proposed 1% pension tax affected prices yet or are homeowners still hopeful they can figure out that shortfall another way?
yes, but we have a housing supply issue in this country, thats why the prices have been going nuts.
and the rich people buying out hundreds of houses to rent out via a property management companies don't care that much about mortgage rates because they are cash buyers

thats why for normal people, the time to buy is now because that $500K house will still be a $500K house.
Even if there is a correction, you can never time it right, and if you are planning to own the home for 10 years, that correction will come and go and your house will still appreciate from the current price.
But that higher interest rate will mean you'll be paying much higher interest for the next 10-20 years(since interest rates are a long term policy, and the trend is now up).
So if you don't buy now, you'll end up paying a million dollars for that $500K house.
4% interest rate on a $500K loan means you spend $20,000 on interest a year before you start covering your principal.
8% interest rate on a $500K loan means you'll have to spend $40,000 on interest a year before you start covering your principal...which essentially doubles your mortgage.
was said by people every year for the past 5 years....and remember when the market collapses, prices don't really go down all that much....the price can just as easily double from here and when it pops, it'll still never reach the current prices.
Like you said yourself, supply isn't the only issue.
One of the bigger ones is rich people/companies buying up property as investment - then renting it out, meaning more people are renting, which generates wealth to the owner, instead of generating wealth for themselves.
Seems accurate to me.
I'm not sure what affordability metrics are more accurate than all-in monthly payments for most homeowners.
The overwhelming majority have to borrow to get started.
&gt;and if you are planning to own the home for 10 years,

This is the real sticking point though.
A lot of people are much more mobile so they're not in one area for a decade.
&amp;#x200B;

If you're able to afford (e.g.)
$500k and are planning to stay somewhere for a decade, you either have kids or want to live in a good job market area.
And the latter (LA, NYC, etc) have ridiculous house prices above $500k.
What?
No one was calling 5 years ago peak market, it was actually almost exactly the bottom of the market in terms of prices.
And the last time the housing market collapsed, it erased nearly [10 years of gains.
](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA#0)
Ok you're the second person to say that.
No one thought housing prices were going to correct 5 years ago.
The **bottom** of the housing market was 2012, not 2008.
5 years ago only crackpots were saying "oh we've had a good 6 month run, guess this bubble about to pop!"
Everyone thought "finally, we might be climbing out of this!"
I took a moment to search the NYT 2013 archives for housing market and found These 3 articles to refresh your memory on what people thought of the market 5 years ago.
[1](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/opinion/sunday/who-wants-to-buy-a-house.html) [2](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/business/economy/gauges-of-home-prices-and-consumer-confidence-rise.html) [3](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/business/economy/home-prices-still-rising-but-at-slower-pace.html)

 Housing prices are increasing at over double the rate of income, meaning these houses are debt not assets.
Prices are now higher than their peak in 2006.
In fact, over the last year alone median prices of existing homes has increased almost $20,000 while existing home sales have DROPPED.
This market HAS to correct.
Prices are going up, demand is going down, income is almost stagnant, and debt to income is going up.
Something has to give here, and I doubt it'll be wages - and if it's not wages then it won't be sales, it'll be price.
The market doesn't have to do anything.
Housing prices are all regional.
How did the DC market fare in 2008-2011?
Barely noticed a blip.
You have it wrong.
Prices are going up because demand is GOING UP.
I suggest you learn a little economics.
Supply is low.
New construction cannot keep up.
I'm in real estate and I remember this well.
Many, many people were calling for "Shadow Inventory" to come hit the market and drop prices even worse than we saw in 2009-2010.
I kept hearing "the REAL drop is about to happen...any day now."
And prices still went up.
Long term, I think real estate is fine...if you're buying now with the intention of flipping in 6-24 months, you might be SOL.
Housing market collapses aren't exactly a regular occurance.
&gt;I suggest you learn a little economics.
Funny you say that because I have a degree in it, so let me teach you.
&gt;The market doesn't have to do anything.
Housing prices are all regional.
Really?
Housing prices are regional, sure.
But the overall market follows market trends, some cities may buck those trends but they're the outliers and not relevant to Macro discussion.
Overall market crashes happen everywhere.
[Just look at how DC faired 2006-2008.
](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WDXRSA) D.C. bucked the downtrend before the rest of the market, but that doesn't mean that in 2006 you should've been buying a home in DC.
In fact, that up trend came back to bite them in the ass because housing prices in DC haven't caught up to the rest of the nation relative to their 2005-06 highs.
Speaking of 05-06 highs it's worth nothing that [we are well above those.
](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CSUSHPINSA) But let's get into what you said.
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Prices are going up because demand is GOING UP.
I suggest you learn a little economics.
Supply is low.
New construction cannot keep up.
Existing home sales are [DOWN](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EXHOSLUSM495S) while existing home prices are [UP.
](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOSMEDUSM052N) New home sales are [the same as Jul 2016](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HSN1F), the number of houses for sale is  [about 50% higher over that same time,](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA) and as you can see from the link above (about the DC prices) prices are WAY up.
Is the market up compared to 2012?
Yes.
Is the market booming, especially compared to any other timeframe, so much that it could justify having prices at historical highs?
No way.
So you said demand is going up, I showed you it is not.
You said supply is low, I showed you it is WAY up.
Since you're claiming to know economics: What happens is demand is low, prices are high, and supply is high?
&amp;#x200B;

Edit: And just released: [Pending home sales fell for the 4th time in 5 months.
](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/27/pending-home-sales-fall-1point8-percent-to-slowest-pace-since-january.html)
You still don't get it.
Compelling case...
&gt; and the rich people buying out hundreds of houses to rent out via a property management companies don't care that much about mortgage rates because they are cash buyers

They're still getting mortgages, esp.
right now.
yes because mortgage rates are still low.
Probably doesn’t matter because it has to come from somewhere.
Income tax?
Less money for homes.
Sales tax?
Less money for homes.
Property tax?
Less money for homes.
Car registration fees?
Less money for homes.
School fees?
Less money for homes.
Housing prices are basically a function of after tax incomes minus money spent on everything else.
Although I agree with your economics the one missing piece is people's irrationality when purchasing a house.
It takes time for the market to make bigger moves as sellers hold out for the previous high price and buys hold out for lower prices so we have this period of waiting before prices decrease.
During that time people still purchase homes at the asking price or slightly below.
Everyone is discouraged by the mountain of debt and doubt it will improve but it's hard for people to leave.
My relatives pay 2.5-3.5% annually (rare to hear of a nice house being less than $9k most 12-15k).
On the other hand, it is a great city in many ways.
Lol it’s not going to be that high for the foreseeable future.
I agree with you, and that's my point.
Prices are irrationally high.
They will HAVE to drop.
Prices cannot continue to rise as demand falls and supply increases.
This guy is saying demand is increasing and supply can't keep up and that just flies in the face of every number out there except perhaps housing starts, which includes rental and multifamily properties that are very relevant to the conversation of the overall market, but not relevant to the conversation of "should you buy a house right now?"
which is what started all of this.
When prices are high, demand is low, supply is high, and interest rates are rising, it's just not a good time to buy a house.
Oh yea totally on board with that and he is ignoring that.
I wouldn't buy right now!

Summary: 
Housing prices are all regional.
Housing prices are regional, sure.
I get 1.8% on my savings.
I wouldn't buy right now!
And prices still went up.
It's useful now that rates are going up.
which is what started all of this.
People have been saying that for 5 years now.
Prices are going up because demand is GOING UP.
Prices are high right now, it's a terrible time to buy.
yes because mortgage rates are still low.
You still don't get it.
Prices are now higher than their peak in 2006.
The market doesn't have to do anything.

So you said demand is going up, I showed you it is not.

At peak market... no thanks.
Most large banks are still keeping the interest rates they pay on savings accounts very low.
$50k is not a requirement for a high interest savings account to be a good decision.
Is the market up compared to 2012?
