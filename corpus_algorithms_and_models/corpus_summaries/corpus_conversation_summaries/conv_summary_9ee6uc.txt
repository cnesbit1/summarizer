The prices for the vet seem ridiculous.
They are.
Pet insurance is vital for this exact reason; most of the time it's a small expense but sometimes vet bills can be insane.
Last year, my brother got cancer and had to go through chemo, my mom had a fungal infection on her heart and had to have open heart surgery, and one of her dogs had to have surgery (I can't remember what for).
My dad was paying for everything insurance didn't cover, and apparently the dog's medical bills were by far the highest.
I think it was over $10k.
As a dog owner I can say they are.
Pet insurance is a MUST
Edit: forgot a word.
My cat got her feet mangled in a trap last week.
Emergency vet=$150, next day amputation and follow up care=$1000.
I have a pet wellness plan through Banfield pet hospital and recently had a $6000 surgery done on my cat for free (I pay $45ish a month and this was the first month, we had only paid $45ish at this point)
What the fuck, a fungal infection on the heart?
Holy shit, how does that happen?
I have a new fear now.

I hope the open heart went well?
I don’t know why people consistently devalue the amount of medical schooling/education that the veterinary profession requires.
Think about it this way; doctors and nurses only have to know about one species but vets have to know about all sorts of them and their patients can’t answer questions about their symptoms.
Also, unless one is dealing with livestock, their patients are much smaller/more delicate than people.
The insurance industry is a fucking cancer that only serves to raise prices.

Which is why pet insurance for young animals is well worth the price.
Yes, actually everything went well, everyone's fully recovered by now.
Well that's the best news!
Glad to hear it.
But to not do what is necessary to save an animal  just because the owner can’t pay?
Seems a bit rubbish.
Aren’t thier payment plans or some thing ?
Vet seems cruel here.

Summary: 
I think it was over $10k.
