**Edit**:  these were all self-obtained.
I am Interested in your Horsea, Vulpix, and Slowpoke.
How many codes you looking for to trade for them?
Vulpix should be 5IV, but with the wrong ability.
I believe Horsea and Slowpoke are outright trophies.
Would you do 2-3 codes for them?
I'm open to discuss.
2-3 Codes each or for all?
for all.
Iâ€™m willing to do 3 Codes for all.
Add and meet in Fes?
Sure, just need a minute to grab them out of bank.
ready when you are.
Added you.
Meeting you in Fes and taking pics of your code.
just tried out the codes and they all work, thanks for the trade.

Summary: 
2-3 Codes each or for all?
I have a few Codes to trade.
