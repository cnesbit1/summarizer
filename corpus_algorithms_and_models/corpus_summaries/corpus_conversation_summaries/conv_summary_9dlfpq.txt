Original Response: 
Is there any advantage to small wings like the F-104 has?
What makes it such a used interceptor?
The F-104 does *****NOT***** have small wings.
It is a very deceptive looking aircraft.
An F-104 has 200 sq ft of wing area for a 6 ton plane.
An F-15 by comparison has 600 sq ft of wing area for an 18 ton plane.
A 747-400 has 5600 sq ft of wing area for a 180 ton plane.
So a 747-400 a jumbo jet has smaller wings than the F-104 relative to the weight they carry.
The F-104 is just a full sized jet engine with parts from a 1/3rd scale plane attached to it.
If you remove the engine and cockpit there is very little else to the aircraft.

I cant find numbers for the total footprint of these planes, what percentage of wing area to total body area would these planes have?
Also wing shape is important obviously, a jumbos wings are more effective at creating powerful lift and the f-104 is great for reduced drag and the f-15 is a feat of engineering I barely wrap my head around.

For reference though, since planes don't take off empty, the F-104 had a max takeoff weight of 14.5 tons, the F-15E, 40.5 tons, and the 747 about 450 tons.
So the ratio still has the 747 with the smaller wings by ratio, but not by quite as much.
The mass of a plane has very little to do with flight.
It's about the lifting coefficient of the plane, and the power to weight ratio.
The design of both the F-15, and even a 747 have much larger lifting areas including both body and wings then a Starfighter.
The F-104 is basically a jet engine with some control surfaces strapped on compared to any other comparable 1950s through 1970s military aircraft.
The body area isn’t particularly relevant to the performance of an aircraft.
The thing that matters for limiting performance is the drag for the body.
You could easily make the fuselage volume 10x bigger and if you reduce it’s drag you end up with higher performance.
That’s why you’ll never see such a number.
The ratio can be arbitrary and change with few consequences like with extended fuselage models.
The wing shape definitely plays a role in efficiency vs performance though.
The F-104 had a comically inefficient wing.
It was so thin that [the leading edges](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a68a20f38d41d01a5e46ebc47886fce-c) had the profile of a knife and needed protective covers on the ground.

I mean, there is a reason it’s unofficial nickname was “The Missile With a Man in It”.
Wingspace is only half the battle.
The thickness of the front compared to the back makes a massive difference.
The planes you mentioned, their wings are proportionally smaller to weight, but they are much thicker.
The pressure differences, and of course the drag as well, are considerably better.
A DC-3 has VERY thick wings overall.
Which is why it can takeoff in shorter spans than a ww1 fighter even gross weight.
The tradeoff being very high drag and slow flying overall.
But its practically a helicopter empty takeoff.
The f-104's wings, much like the f-5 or f-20, are razor thin.
No angle of attack much at all.
Its lifting muscle is pathetic.
Probably stalls at 220mph or more gross weight.
Its built for speed and high-G high speed based maneuvers only.
Not my cup of tea at all, but i can respect purpose-built aircraft.
A conventional round fuselage, such as the F-104 has, produces negligible lift, but the F-15's body actually does produce useful amounts of lift.
The lifting body design is the reason an Israeli F-15 made it home despite having a wing sheared off almost at the root in a midair collision.
The pilot didn't realize how much of the wing he'd lost until he landed, and McDonnell-Douglas engineers said it couldn't fly until they saw pictures.
After some wind tunnel work, they found that the lifting body design was more effective than they thought.

Also 'The Widowmaker'.
I believe the export versions were loaded up with close support ordnance that compromised the already marginal low-speed characteristics, and caused a lot of crashes on landing.
when you see one in person it all makes sense... First time I saw an F-15E my jaw dropped.
Similar for the Hercules and the Galaxy; I knew the Galaxy was bigger, but seeing them side by side the Hercules almost fits inside of it, I was so off on the perception of the Galaxy's size.
Even cylindrical passenger aircraft produce quite a bit of lift with the fuselage.
Not as much as the F15, but it's one of the only reasonable ways to achieve elliptical loading across the span of the aircraft.

I was at the Cleveland airshow last weekend and saw a lot of C130s and thought they would be huge.
They were obviously larger than the average military plane but when I saw the size of the C5M (Super)galaxy I was blown away.
Compared to the size of the C130s parked next to it my mind was blown.
I swear you could fit 2-3 C130s inside the Galaxy/Supergalaxy if you folded their wings up.

Not just almost.
If you take the wings and horizontal/vertical stabs off a C-130, it does fit inside a C-5, and in fact, has actually been done in the past.

C-5 always comes with a big dose of awe when you see one for the first time.

When you consider the "cost" of a pilot in salary, training expense (jets drink expensive fuel), etc., that jet cost Germany a LOT of money.

I was talking about the effective area of lift vs total area of aircraft then trying to work out how much force each wing generates, so basically the wings on the f-104 are more like fins on a surfboard.
I was in awe from both being around and inside one and again when watching it take off.
That plane defies all laws of gravity upon takeoff.

I got to drive a 37,000lbs truck into a Galaxy once.
We had to damn near flatten the tires, but I stuffed it on in there (phrasing).
We then drove 3 or 4 MORE trucks in there.
And then watched it take off.

At an air show years ago, I had a great time walking around an F-16.
Standing under the wing, I had to put my ear on my shoulder to fit.
After that I went over to an F-15 and had to stretch out my fingers to touch the wing.
The F-15 is *huge*.
Someday I hope to do such a walkaround of an F-22.
They seem to be of similar size to the F-15, but I've not googled the specs.
*Definitely* sexier, though.

Not just those two things but they also require a purpose to fly too.
And the weight associated with that purpose is likely pretty significant (much moreso than the pilot at least).

C-130: F-150 of the sky.
It can go off-roading and haul some stuff for the weekend.
C-17:Semi-Truck of the sky.
Still pretty flexible in where you can drive it, and you don’t even always need pavement.
You can take the whole house with!
C-5: freight train of the sky.
You can only go certain places because you’re so big, but you can move an entire construction crew, including all their vehicles!
1 and 2 ejects for my relatives respectively.
They both went on to pilot  F4 phantom II's;

Apparently a difference of night and day; but then again, as germans do, they got them delivered with all these cool useful gadgets, that was not in the contract (might have this a bit wrong/backwards), then paid more money to have them removed; only to have them bought again at a later date and reinstalled at a premium.
&amp;#x200B;

Apparently they were a technological joke compared to the Turkish F4's, in terms of capabilities; but then again the turks used to steal the german firefighting equipment every-time the germans brought that stuff with them, cause the turks did not really have any.

The first time I saw one I was driving parallel to the runway at KIA heading toward the side gate doing about 60kmh, I saw this strange shape heading toward me and realised it was the wing tip sticking out over the road outside the airport fence.
I then listened to that thing sitting on the runway for a good 4 hours, just humming about a km away.

So the F 15 and F 104  wings are , at least by weight and ratio and proportion , the same size .
[removed]
The F-22 sits a little closer to the ground, but they're both about the same size.
The F-22 is *really* impressive to see in person though, and you definitely should if you get the chance.

That was the F104-G, (for "Germany").
The Germans wanted an all-weather multi-role aircraft but bought a fairweather fighter with enough strapped to it to pretend otherwise.
It killed a LOT of pilots...

The Antonov AN-225: the container ship of the sky?
They had it parked at MSP overnight when I worked there.
Incredible plane.
Even more importantly, in times of war you want to save your pilots at any cost.
It's relatively easy to make new planes, but training new pilots takes a lot of preparation and time.
That's basically what led to the demise of the German air force after a few years of WWII - keeping experienced pilots in the field too long and having too many of them killed, losing their experience and ability to teach new pilots better, thus resulting in badly trained rookie pilots entering the field against professionally trained allied pilots.
At the beginning of WWII the German air force had some of the most experienced and best trained personnel worldwide or at least in Europe.
IIRC, In the early 40s, when the British and Americans were training their new pilots  extensively (up to 100-300 flight hours before entering conflict), the German air force was burning through their experienced pilots on the front lines and throwing in inexperienced pilots at something like 20-30 flight hours.
Keeping that in mind the post-war Starfighter fiasco would have had really bad effects in war times, especially considering that air superiority was necessarily required to deny attacks of superior Soviet mechanised ground forces.

Crap, last weekend?!
I missed it?
Damn it.
Yeah last weekend.
On the bright side, it'll be back next year and the Thunderbirds will be there and flying.
At least we have that to look forward to!

I'm not sure it's actually louder, but it sure feels like next level loud compared to a 14 or 15.
Same problem with the F-102 Delta Dagger, except it had delta shaped wings like a triangle.
It was designed as an interceptor for incoming Soviet bombers.
It was intended for fast (very fast) straight-line flying.
The small wings made it like five or six times more dangerous to fly than more modern jet fighters.
and it still had enormous transsonic drag because the area rule hasn't been discovered yet.
I was thinking "but delta wings have a pretty natural advantage there, look a that gentle increase in area because of the steadily increasing wing size.
Sure, it could use a little waist pinching, but..." then my eyes went to the end of the plane, where all the wing just... stops.
Oh.
Right.
*That's* not a gradual change in area.
Is there a primer on "why planes are the way they be"?
Like why the different shapes and wing types and so on and what role they play vs physics ?

There's lots of different rules...
But it's all trade offs.
Big thick wings might have more drag but they can carry lots of fuel and stores etc.
Large wings can give excellent turn rate but terrible roll rate etc.
The area rule is worth looking into though.
Basically if you cut an airplane up like salami, you want the total area of each slice to be the same - even if the shape of each slice is wildly different.
Anderson's Intro to Flight might be the best option for the basics without the prerequisite knowledge.
In reality, fixed-wing aircraft design books (that really address the basics of why they be how they be) are senior-level undergraduate texts because the chain of prerequisites goes roughly like Calculus + Physics &gt; Differential Equations &gt; Fluid Mechanics + Mechanics of Materials &gt; Aerodynamics &gt; Stability and Controls + Vibrations + Aerospace Structures &gt; Flight Mechanics &gt; Design.
Aerospace undergraduate design "capstone" courses really earn the moniker.
Sadly, I can also tell you that most fresh graduates with a bachelor's in AE still won't be able to answer many of the "why" questions simply because there are so many considerations.
As discussed elsewhere in the thread, if the F-104 didn't actually have small wings for its size (200 square feet for 6 tons empty / 13 tons MTOW) then the F-102 *definitely* didn't have small wings for its size (660 square feet for 9 tons empty / 11 tons MTOW).
In fact, its wings are [larger than that of the ATR-42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATR_42#Specifications) while the ATR's MTOW is over 18 tons.
The F-102's troubles were elsewhere.

On a related note, that's why the T-38 supersonic jet trainer, which was designed around this same time period but is still used today to train USAF pilots, seems to have such stubby wings and aerodynamically is a very high wing-loading plane.
It was meant to emulate the flight characteristics of the F-100, F-102, F-105, and other high-speed-optimized interceptors.
No fly-by-wire, HUD, or leading-edge extensions like nearly all frontline US fighters now have.
Nor does it have automatic flaps like its derivative, the F-5 Tiger II (also known as the "MiG-28" in the movie Top Gun).
For those reasons, though, it is incredibly unforgiving at low speeds and especially low altitudes.
Many T-38 pilots have been killed in the landing pattern as a result of pushing bad approaches.
You're rolling the dice if you develop a high sink rate and don't execute a stall recovery.
That being said, if you can fly a T-38, you can fly just about any pointy-nose fighter.
It's only now that the fleet is now on average 50+ years old and there is an increased need for undergraduate pilots to learn more complex sensor and systems management that the USAF is seeking a replacement.
