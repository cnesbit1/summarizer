Feels good having a guy that can clap bombs accurately again.
I swear it's been since Lidstrom since someone could do that on this team.
Giving me Frk flashbacks.
"what a frk'n shot!"
Yeah, fuck off buddy we absolutely need more Zadina clips.
Fuckin every time this kid steps on the ice someone scores.
kids fuckin dirt nasty man.
I'm fuckin tellin ya Filip "golden flow" Zadina is pottin 50 in '19 fuckin callin it right now.
Clap bombs, fuck moms, wheel, snipe, and fuckin celly boys fuck.
It's amazing how much a guy like that changes an entire PP.
There's just a world of difference between the teams that have one (Ovi, Laine, Stammer etc) and teams (like us) that don't.
Those PP goals will win you games,  having Zadina should greatly increase our very lackluster PP of the last couple years.
I had high hope for Pulkkinen to fill that void.
Better late than never.
Pulkkinen had an awesome clapper too, if it was on target.
Same here.
Aka pulk 2.0.
I'm sure Tarasenko could send clappers like that if he wanted to, but he's always looking for a quick snapper.
Dude I can’t tell you the last time we had a shooter on the team.
Our organization gets boners over playmaking abilities.
Pretty sure that happened all of one time in Detroit.
Our pp has been shriveled up into a chode the past like 3 years or whatever.
I heard this Zadina kid has a fricken wrench to fix that though.
Bro that’s Laines line.
Z will earn his own.
Except Frk hit the damn net now and then.
The Moose boys.
They should pick up Bodnarchuk as well.
