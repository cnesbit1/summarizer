Based on last year can I say Ovechkin?
The sheer will and drive to win the cup put him above the speed and skill of McDavid, and above the elite hockey iq of Crosby.
In a vacuum I think McDavid has either surpassed or will pass Crosby this year, itâ€™s close.
Ovi is absolutely not better than McDavid or Crosby lol.
No, based on last year you can't say Ovechkin.
Unless you're a delusional caps fan who is tripping LSD.
Sorry for using goals and wins as a metric, silly me.
Did Kuznetsov not have a sheer will and drive to win the cup (and outscore Ovi in the playoffs)?
McDavid produced way more goals than Ovi and winning is a team accomplishment, shouldnt be used to judge two individual players.
Ovi had more goals, so no.
Kuznetsov has more points though.
&gt;McDavid produced way more goals than Ovi

That's interesting, because I'm quite sure Ovi won the Rocket Richard trophy as the league's leading goal scorer.
McDavid produced more points, not goals.
I didnt say he personally scored more, but yea he had more points so he produced more goals for his team than Ovi did.
That's not how assists work.
You don't watch McDavid if that's what you think.
You don't watch hockey if that's what you think.

Summary: 
Ovi had more goals, so no.
McDavid produced more points, not goals.
