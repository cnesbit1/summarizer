Original Response: 
I wonder what was said to her to give her that face?
I read through the transcript.
One of the journalists asked if he could tap the side of her neck with his sharpie - part of a long running joke within the NBC news team.
He was not asked to leave but the condition for him staying was that he was only allowed to ask a question about her using words no longer than 4 letters long and in one sentence containing exactly 7 words.
'tis a fair query m'lord!
I swear she looks like that doge meme.
