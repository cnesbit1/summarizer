Original Response: 
God's law is eternally binding.
"The law," that is, the Mosaic system, is what was done away with; but the principles are still here.
For instance, the ten commandments define and condemn all manner of sin.
They still define sin today.
The Mosaic system teaches us that the wages of sin is death, and that in order for the transgressor to live, a substitute must die in his place.
It is still the same today, except we do not need the Mosaic system to teach us this.
We may look back upon the Mosaic system, as well as the fulfillment in Christ, to see what our sins have done.
This is to cause us to abhor sin and turn from it.
But how can we know what to turn from?
By the law of God, particularly as described in the ten commandments.
So then, the rituals, the ceremonies, the earthly temple; it is all done away with as a foreshadowing of the work of Christ.
The lessons taught therein are not.
Sin is still sin.
Atonement is still needed for sin.
Sin must be cleansed and done away with.
And sin is defined by the ten commandments.

How is it not?

This is more complicated by language shifting and being used figuratively.
The Hebrew word used for "covet" in the commandment, much like the plain understanding of "covet", has the implication of a desire that is either strong and/or with potential will to acquire.
But the commandment doesn't refer to coveting in general.
It specifies things that should not be coveted:  “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:17 NASB)

That leads to a particular definition of "covet" in English that has implication beyond the plain form:  ["to desire wrongfully, inordinately, or without due regard for the rights of others"](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/covet).
Compare this to the use of the word "lust" in the New Testament.
In the original Greek, this is the same word used for "covet".
We wouldn't typically refer to simply thinking someone is attractive or seeking to marry someone as "lust".
We could do so and be grammatically correct, but it might a certain implication.
So it is with "covet".
I'm all for using these terms in their plain meanings, minus the implication.
We just have to be aware that the writing of the Bible expects us to be aware of the difference between the plain meaning of the word and the particular meaning it uses that word to convey.

Coveting your neighbours house involves a failure to love your neighbour.
It fails to appreciate your neighbours good as equal to your own.

Covet does not mean want in Christian moral theology.

Again...  words can have different meanings.
If I tell you I can't pay my rent because "I don't have the dough", you would not assume I'm talking about my baking business.
We have to look at the meaning being conveyed.
Jesus had problems with people not doing this, whether or not he was intentionally coding his meaning in parables.
* John 3:  "You must be born again."
*"What, you want me to crawl back into my mother's womb?
"*
* John 6:  "I am the bread of life."
*"What, you want us to be cannibals?
"*

Don't think about what you mean when you use a word.
Think about what the author/speaker is trying to convey when they use it.
If one's use of "covet" means "wants something enough to go buy it", then that isn't the sort of coveting we're talking about.
I explained why I used the word "lust" in my original comment:

&gt;Compare this to the use of the word "lust" in the New Testament.
In the original Greek, this is the same word used for "covet".
You can imagine how, after being uses to describe covetousness in the context of sexual desire, "lust" came to also have the meaning of sexual desire itself.
But you should also be able to imagine how someone could use a word and not mean every possible definition of it.
Something like excessively desiring something, tending towards idolatry.
While also viewing your good, satisfaction as more important than others.
Greed, spite and selfishness are all part of the equation.
Covetousness is selfishness.
It is the root of every evil there is, and the very antithesis of the kingdom of God.
Covet means envy in this case.

Summary: 
So it is with "covet".

Atonement is still needed for sin.
Compare this to the use of the word "lust" in the New Testament.
