Original Response: 
I guess unless you're on the other side, Reddit has created a "safe space" for QAnon deniers who don't want any alternative viewpoints for debate.
That's literally insane.
A social media service destroying its users they don't like for no good reason at all.
Qanon doesn't need deniers, it's blatantly, ridiculously untrue.
What's more, the users were calling for the deaths of people daily.

I'm not lying, but you are.
There were calls for the deaths of Obama, HRC, Podesta and more every single day.
The writers weren't removed, they were celebrated and called patriots.
Just because a LARP has convinced you they're dangerous, doesn't mean you can call for their heads without it being a call to violence.
So by your logic, r/news should be next...

I was on the sub, I saw people talking about traitors hanging constantly.
Anyone can pull the archive and see I'm telling the truth.
You're the only one gaslighting here.
By the way, Q is fake and everyone with common sense knows it.
Says the account with only 2 weeks of history.
I'm sure your legit...

Account is 4 years old, deleted my post history because someone on this sub tried to dox me.
