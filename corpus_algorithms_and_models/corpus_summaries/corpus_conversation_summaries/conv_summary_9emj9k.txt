##NEW BIKE SUPERTHREAD!
- a thread for questions and advice about gear and bike purchases and questions relating to your newly purchased bike/gear.
Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is.
The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.
Hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered.
Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all.
Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are.
Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle.
As always please remember to read the FAQ.
Who knows - if your question is deemed to be helpful it may be added to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_good_starter_bike.3F) (which you should read)!

Ok - simple question.
Klim or Dainese 

(Specifically Two mesh textile jackets, it gets HOT out here)
whatever you prefer.
Are you asking in general?
Or do you have two jackets in mind?
Well I have two jackets in mind but it’s more the case that I’m a Brit, living in the US.
I’ve heard (obviously) a lot about Dianaise, but less about Klim so I’m seeing how the quality/protection matches up?
Klim is typically more American cut and is more utilitarian.
Dainese is more Euro cut and... well, Italian haha.
Really, you should go to a store and just try them on.
Ohhhh I see where you are coming from.
I think they are both high quality products just amid at different market group.
KLIM is more about that ADV group.
I think you need to look at the jackets themselves vs the brand if you're trying to decide on quality/protection.
If all else is the same to you, Klim REALLY backs up their gear.

I haven't had to use it yet but I was surprised after buying a pair of pants to find this out.
If your shoulders are broad Dainese won’t fit well.
The Klim Apex Air saved my shoulder and arms in a crash a couple of months ago and it flows a fukton of air.
As others have said, Klim is typically more ADV oriented, but their street gear (Apex/Apex Air/K-51/K52) is more protective and higher quality than the Dainese equivalents.
It’s not cheap though.
Thanks dude question, how'd the d3o hold up?
Was it level 1 or 2?
Back was level 2, arms/elbows level 1 or 2 depending on ambient temp and it was a hot day but can’t remember which way that works.
The D3O was awesome, definitely would have broken my collarbone without it.
I hit a deer at 60mph+, flew over the handlebars and through the air for 10 or so yards and landed on my shoulder and hip on chipseal and then slid on my chest and (outstretched) arms for another 15 yards at least.

Summary: 
KLIM is more about that ADV group.
Or do you have two jackets in mind?
Ohhhh I see where you are coming from.
Was it level 1 or 2?
If all else is the same to you, Klim REALLY backs up their gear.
