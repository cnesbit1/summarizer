##BIKE/GEAR IMAGE MEGATHREAD!
- a thread for you to show off your bike or gear purchases and any associated images.
Everyone loves showing off their bike and gear, so here is a dedicated thread just for that.
If you've just bought a new bike, new gear or have a collection of images related to that, post them below for other Rideitors to enjoy!
Did you ride your brand-new bike 60 miles back from the dealership and took some pics on the way?
Did you see an interesting custom bike in the mall parking lot?
Was it just a really nice sunny day and you wanted to play with your new DSLR?
SHOW IT OFF HERE!
Of course, if you have a great story to tell and an album with good captions to go along with it, you are still welcome to post it in the main subreddit.
You can also make a selfpost with a discussion starter and any photographs you like linked in the text post area.
If you're not sure if your pics tell enough of a story, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmotorcycles&amp;subject=&amp;message=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fmotorcycles) and we will let you know where to post them.
Meta content will be removed.
This thread will be refreshed every other Monday.

I’m in love with riding!

Very nice!
How long have you been riding?
I have only been riding on street a few weeks.
I've rode dirt bikes my whole life.
How do you like the jacket?
Love gold upside down forks.
Even if they're not super-fancy, they still look cooler than regular forks.
The jacket is nice for when it’s hot.
It’s really light and has good airflow.
I have two other jackets.
One for winter and one with more padding and a rain liner.
The jacket in the image is from Joe Rocket.
Yeah I love the naked bike look.
The gold forks don’t match the bike, but it has a really nice clash.
Best upgrade you can make for it are some new fork internals and a shock out back.
Don't need to spend $3k on all new Ohlins everywhere, even the cheapest options sprung properly for your weight will make a **big** difference

New exhausts are fun, but in terms of actually improving the bike/rideability, it's not even close!
Enjoy.
Head on over to [fz09.org](https://fz09.org) forums if you haven't seen em yet.
An excellent resource for any questions you may have, and a pretty good community of riders.
Thank you so much for the information!
I’m looking into it now and also making an account on the forums!
Wow what a first bike.
Enjoy that engine its a treat.
Looking sharp!
I'm loving it.
I have yet to mess with A mode, but she is a dream.
That's my favorite color scheme of any of the fz/Mt 09s.
Beautiful bike.
Did you take the MSF course in Dalton?
I'm going to be taking it this weekend.
No I just took the permit test.
I think I’m gonna take the course soon.
We should ride sometime man!
