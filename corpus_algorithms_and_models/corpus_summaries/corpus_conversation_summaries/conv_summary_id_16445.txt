Looks like she's wearing white socks.
Good eye.
Maybe too many hours in the tennis court, not enough relaxing.
Although considering the rest of her it's not exactly an overpowering turn-off.
She's just as incredible looking in person.
So this was 2006?
That's the only time she would be allowed to pose with the trophy.
I was under the impression that it was taken recently, in the past week or two.
No, if you look closely at the right of the screen, you'll see a match between Pavlyuchenkova and Pazcek.
Those two only met once in the USA, in the US Open junior finals, in 2006.
I'm impressed, you know a lot about tennis, or are good with logic and research.
Yeah, I've followed tennis for a long time :) I'm a bit obsessed.

Summary: 
She's just as incredible looking in person.
