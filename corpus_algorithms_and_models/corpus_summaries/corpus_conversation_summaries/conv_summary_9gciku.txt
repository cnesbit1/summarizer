&gt;Forget it, ok?
That moment when Stephanie realises what she's done wrong *but it still has to be someone else's fault*.
Ugh, right!?
so annoying.
My life over text-based customer service.

I can see what they type before sending and sometimes see stuff like "omg I'm an idiot" that gets erased and replaced with a thank you.
I try to be really nice to those people.
Wait ... you can see what we type at all times?
I mean, I'm a smart enough person and I've had some seriously blonde moments not much better/worse than this.
I always choose to point out that I was being stupid and we all have a good laugh.
I guess the difference between me and Stephanie is that I'm confident in not actually an idiot.
Depends on the software used but yes, a lot of industry standard chat based support offers live preview of what the customer's typing.
Sleep tight!
O.O.
Shiiiiiiiiit lmao 

Seriously would have been nice to know that like, years ago lol 

You joke but I think this is actually gonna keep me up tonight.
Same.

Usually, yep ;)
I'm totally gonna use this to write silly jokes out or something like that without sending it to them next time I do this for customer support.
I'm not sure what exactly you'd be worried about them learning about in a customer service chat.
I wouldn't think you'd ever type anything worse than "omg I'm an idiot" or whatever.
I really doubt the website software would capture things typed in other browser tabs or programs.
omg what.
I'm totally gonna fuck with them now.
"I think I'm in love with y-" holds backspace, "Thanks, bro."
This comment is insulting.
I would love to see that in my support chats.
I'm sorry Stephanie!
This is what working in customer service feels like.
TBH I once had almost this exact conversation when working in customer service.
I remember one lady few years back.
*Lady:* I can't remember my password for the website.
Can you reset it?
*Me:* **I** can't, no miss.
But I can direct you on how to do it yourself.
*Lady:* How?
*Me:* See under the password tab, where it says forgot your password?
Just click on that.
*Lady*: ...

*Me:* Miss?
*Lady:* YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SMARTASS ABOUT IT!
*Me:* I... Wasn't?
That's how you-

*Lady:* I wanna speak to your manager!
“I’m trying to order a steak and cheese and it’s telling me to pick my cheese” 

“Ok what kind of cheese do you want?” 

“Doesn’t steak and cheese normally have American?” 

“Uhm I’m not sure.
These are all completely customizable so you can put whatever you want on it” 

“*Grumbles* Ok this says do I want it toasted?
I don’t want the bread toasted” 

“Ok you can just hit no” 

“Normally steak and cheese isn’t toasted?
*HUFFS*” 

“I’m not sure what kind you’re talking about.
These are made exactly how you order it” 

Angrily “Ok, thanks” Eyeroll.

To be fair the wraps do have presets but idk about the regular subs.
Before I started working there I thought nothing had recommended ingredients.
Am I missing something here?
The customer sounds pretty reasonable.
Not too many stores carry a max of large for all their clothes.

Working where?
I feel like I've missed the joke.
Subway :)
