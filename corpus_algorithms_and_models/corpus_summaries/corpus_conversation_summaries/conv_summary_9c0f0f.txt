Original Response: 
Pretty much radio silence on his case since April.
Can someone who knows more about our legal system explain what’s happened since then?
He was committed to a trial by jury after a committal hearing in the magistrates court.
Edit; media need to be very careful about reporting on matters before the court.
When does this start?
Or are we not supposed to know until it’s finished?
Not sure.
There were some directions hearings as he was also facing another trial I think.
&gt; Or are we not supposed to know until it’s finished?
Yep, that's it.
The court has placed a "super-ban" on it.
The media can't report on any aspect of the trial, nor can they report on the fact that are not allowed to report on it.
If they do so, they will be charged with contempt of court.
A committal doesn't involve a jury, it's a magistrate reviewing the evidence and sometimes witnesses giving testimony to see if there is enough to proceed to trial.
Most defendents waive the committal to not give the prosecution or witnesses a practice run to get their stories straight.
Not sure if Pell waived his or not.
Which is real 'justice that's seen to be done'.
Frankly that it's not being held in the open stinks to high heaven and means that people will not accept the verdict, unless that verdict is guilty.

Washed clean...
We should be able to see what happened after the fact.
The alternative is even worse trial by media.

At the end of the current farce, nothing will have changed.
If he is found not guilty in secret then the catholics will still believe him, and the rest of the public think he had been let off by a corrupt court.
If he is found guilty then the public will feel vindicated and the catholics will claim to have been persecuted in a kangaroo court.
Like it or not, the trial of a public figure or public event is held in public, by the public.
Only where the evidence is rehearsed in public and minds changed as to guilt or innocence can there be said to have been justice done.
In fact, it worse than that.
There are two case being heard by the court of public opinion, that of Pell's guilt or innocence, and the other of the competence of the court to reach a trustworthy verdict.
That second case has already been lost.
In the end the secret court will end, and the real case will begin.
The evidence will be gone over again, the cases made, and people will make THEIR verdict, ignoring this secret court as broken.
It won't be as good, because all the evidence won't be heard and picked over slowly - but it will be the only one that matter.
The fundamental problem is the court is under the misapprehension that the public trust them and their verdicts - and the reality is that because of daft behaviours like this, they don't.

&gt; To publish the details of the first trial would irreparably compromise the second.
To not publicly hold the first makes BOTH invalid, the only place it really matters.
As I said, if this were covered day by day, them more evidence and details would be weighed by the public than will now be the case.
The court of public opinion will still sit, and will still reach it's verdict (basically Pell will be assumed guilty unless something come out of the court case that can prove his innocence).
&gt; Any "verdict" which the public may come to is wholly inreliable.
It's going to be more unreliable now, but its still the only one that will matter.

My wish is simple - justice is SEEN to be done.
Stop playing games with procedure, and stop trying to hide away the evidence in the fear that people will make up their own minds.
That will happen no matter what.

You seem to be confused about how courts are run.
The injunction only works until the trial is over.
Once there is a verdict, the transcripts and evidence and anything else all become public.
It's only **temporarily hidden**.
The reason is because jury members aren't held for the duration of the trial in a hotel or something like on tv.
They go home every night and it could influence their decision making if they were to see reporting on the matter before they had returned a verdict.
There will be plenty of time for public scrutiny once the real and proper scrutiny is done.
At the end of this Pell will either be in jail, or walking the streets.
What he won't be, either way, is proven innocent in the eyes of the public, because the public have been denied that opportunity.
A trial in secret has denied him any chance to clear his name, and therefore denied justice.
Justice needs to be done -- and be able to *be* done -- before it's seen to be done.
In this case, open coverage would either end up as a trial-by-media, or would be a simple reason for the defence to call the trial into question because of tainting.
It's in the interests of all parties for things to go by the book.
Public interest is high, but it doesn't outweigh the need for a clean procedure of justice.
I'd not accept a verdict after trial by media.
I'd be careful /u/donners22, attitude like that may be found to constitute contempt of the court of public opinion.
The appellate court is *Trial By Kyle*, so be wary.
