You know, we talk mad shit about influencers and how vapid it all is, but each of them do have followers in the hundreds or thousands.
We as a society have just.. enabled it.
Somehow enough of us still buy into this trash.
We live in a society.

It is important to note that buying thousands of fake Instagram followers is a thing.
Some of them buy likes and followers to gain traction in their 'career'.
Some of them attract followers by being a chi ko pek bait.
Go check their list of followers to see the real trend.

influencers are just the newest version of FHM, Maxim, Stuff, et al.
not a coincidence that all of them shut down as Instagram gained popularity.

Well aye you might just be right.
You no longer need to pay for a magazine to bust a nut.
A free app on your phone suffices.
The funny thing is the products they tend to advertise might be out of the reach of their largest audience.
Plus most people follow their accounts to see skin anyway.
So why are these companies spending so much money on “influencer marketing”?

With friends in the advertising industry, influencer advertising is also slowly dying, because views and likes are now starting to not translate into actual sales.
Brands are also starting to look to spend their money elsewhere instead of just "quote me for 10% off"
