Hi, I am a thief main.
I want to pick up a new class.
I am thinking about a warrior or ranger.
What should I choose?
I play mostly PvE (fractals, open world) and sPvP.
What sort of gameplay do you enjoy?
As I said I play mostly fractals (not highest tier at the moment), open world events, world bosses, recently I've played a little bit of PvP.
for pve, both are great and sought for (banner warrior and druid).
I mean in terms of playstyle.
Do you enjoy having a variety of different skills, do you enjoy a fast paced combat etc?
Oh..
Sorry, I am a little bit sleepy.
Hmm...
I am not even quite sure what I enjoy.
I think I rather enjoy DPSing more than supporting.
That's for sure.
Fast paced combat seems a good playstyle for me.
Moroever and first of all I want to be useful in all of those gamemodes that I've mentioned above.
In terms of difficultness of a class: an easy or medium one would be my choice.
Maybe Dragonhunter could be for you.
It's a staple of raids and fractals, does good dps, the rotation isn't really hard to pull of but still feels impactful.
I can't decide.
:(
Warrior has several specs right now for DPS and Support while remaining 'easy' and for my personal preference it has a really satisfying and fast playstyle with spellbreaker.
Could send me a build, please?
For open world, I run dagger/axe (or axe/dagger) and greatsword.
Take strength, discipline, and spellbreaker lines.
Healing Signet and 'for great justice' for utility (the rest are up to you).
Axe-dagger-greatsword allow you to be a whirling jumping leaping agent of death.
So fun!
If you want specifics of more meta fractal/raid builds, I'd suggest looking up build guides and experiment with what feels good.
IIRC, metabattle has open world and fractal/raid builds.

Summary:
