This is what I feel Mandarin lessons in Singapore.
They focus too much on the actual memorisation of words and idioms.
Things like giving a news article to you to decipher isn't going to help because these aren't common in everyday speech.
I just wish that they would focus more on daily conversational stuff, which I feel is more important.
If you know what to call a word, you'd probably be able to at least guess how it's written.
How is forcing them to answer questions based on a bunch of China stories going to help if they are reading something that they're unfamiliar to begin with?
Just think about it, most people aren't really bad at Chinese.
They know the basic sentence structures, it's just that they use a lot of loan words when they don't know a certain 單詞 in Mandarin.
Most people learn how to read Chinese characters because they learn through context and awareness of the word itself.
^ this and the Chinese teachers need to stop beating the students over the knuckles with wooden rulers too.
Rote learning is definitely a product of outdated teaching methods.
But sometimes they have no choice but to focus on memorization because the fundamentals of kids are very weak.
If they don't use the language frequently outside the classroom, they have to be taught like they are strangers to the language.
And I think teaching with "a bunch of China stories" is the very basis of education and connection with racial heritage.
No one complains about using books from the Western canon to teach English.

lol get fucked.
Chinese education is already almost non-existent in Singapore and you want to turn our Chinese syllabus into some half-arsed 'Chinese as a second language'?
I'm sorry it offends you that there remain some Chinese people in Singapore who value Chinese as a more than a tool of communication (lol in fact if you really want to participate in meaningful dinner conversation with educated Chinese people, CSL ain't gonna cut it when they name drop historical figures or quote from some poem you've never heard of, much less when idioms are considered assumed knowledge).
This is why I wish MOE really just made all the haters drop Chinese or make a CSL course for them and refocus resources into HCL.
Besides, in Anglo countries there's generally no separation of 'literature' and 'English' in schools - it's just called 'English'; I don't see why there should be for the Chinese syllabus.

Where are you getting that?
I'm not saying that it should be turned into some half-arsed 'Chinese as a second language'.
Different methods of learning the language should be included in addition to the current syllabus in order to adapt to the current situation in Singapore.
How are the students going to learn when they can't even read or understand what they're being taught?
I feel that it's the Chinese characters that's the problem.
There's a lot of people that I know who are completely fluent in Singaporean Mandarin but still somehow struggled with Chinese lessons in school because they couldn't understand what they're reading or what they're required to write.
I find that rather interesting as the issue seems to be less prominent as compared to English/Malay/Tamil from what I have personally seen.

Wtf.
during my o'lvls year my MT teacher (who was also the HOD of the MT dept) uses words to beat us instead

"you're so shit you should have just taken Chinese B. so that i won't have to see your face."
fuck you Ms "old-virgin" Lee.
老处女 hahaha what a apt name for a Chinese language teacher.

Because Chinese is not the official working language or medium of choice.
It's a second language and should be treated as such.
I'm sorry that you feel differently but too bad our benevolent dictators have already decided that for you.
Seriously.
The standard of Chinese in Singapore is appalling.
Most kids are unable to even speak more than a few sentences without having to use English.

&gt; That's why people like you should fuck off.
You claim to value the Chinese language and its heritage, but instead of trying to convince others of its importance, you're just taking a hostile, antagonistic stance.
It is exactly because of bleeding hearts like you, with your sanctimonious platitudes, that non-mandarin speakers are turned off.
You think you're fighting for your heritage, when you're really just doing a great job at destroying it.
there are enough of us out there that don't need convincing.
I never needed any convincing as to why I should or need to learn Chinese.
why should we waste resources on people like you that need convincing to learn Chinese?
if anything, getting rid of the haters means the government can save money and redirect resources to those people that actually want to learn Chinese (you know, streaming?)
Lol people like you just don't get it, and that's why the Chinese language is dying a slow and painful death in Singapore.

what is it i need to get?
i have no doubt the language is dying here but encouraging bananas is not going to help when resources are wasted on them.
the government pours all the money and wonders why the outcome is so bad when the answer is simple - it's wasting money on people who don't care.
it's kinda funny really when many actual bananas (ABCs) speak and write better Chinese *and* English than Singaporean-bananas.

Because those languages have a real alphabet while in Mandarin each word is its own symbol.
Good for you then, enjoy reading your Chinese classics and consuming Chinese media in your spare time.
Just don't fuck it up for the rest of us.

lol i'm not even that into Chinese.
but anyway, how am i fucking it up for you?
you're the ones fucking it up for us.
you all should just tell MOE how much you hate Chinese and just drop it.
&gt; This is exactly why you just don't get it.
don't get what?
honestly you can't just keep replying with a non-reply.
Multiple people have tried to tell you, only to be treated to the hostility of your hubris and ignorance.
Now, you are asking to be spoonfed.
Truly, you are a product of the Singapore system.
