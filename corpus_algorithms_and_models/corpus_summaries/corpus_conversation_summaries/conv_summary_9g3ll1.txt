I'm considering booking a flight there now for a few days.
This city looks right up my ally.
Trade you my Texas 100 lol.

" Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days),[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador#cite_note-Foggiest_location-47) windiest (24.3¬†km/h (15.1¬†mph) average speed),[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador#cite_note-Windiest_location_year-round-48) and cloudiest (1,497¬†hours of sunshine).
[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador#cite_note-Cloudiest_skies_year-round-49) Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round.  "
" The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States.
The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. "
Sounds fun.
He's got gills.
It's a blast.
Where else are you going to find hurricane strength blizzards?
We‚Äôve gotta science our way to perpetual fall.
On the real.
Around 25C and 50% humidity.
Just warm enough to be in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops.
Would be perfect all year round.
Oh no damn my poor education.
Apologies my northern brethren.
