Doesn't u/Dong_Magnum deserve an explanation for being banned?
Before you suggest that he appeal it through mod-mail, he already has and has not received a valid response.

I guess you're right, the mods don't like my comment/question.
It was up to 5 or more upvotes, now it's down to just 2.
I guess I should be thankful that they have not banned me yet.
Despite the low number of points showing, I know there are a lot of subscribers watching this thread, waiting for an honest answer.
My suspicion is the mods are attempting to prevent inside information from leaking out.
Banning anyone who talks about it seems real fishy.
An honest straight forward answer would make a lot more sense than just down voting my question.
Is that too much to ask?
That's not it at all what is happening.
We don't ban people without just cause.
Discussion on his ban can take place in modmail.
It is not something we are going to discuss in open thread.
Don’t you think the community deserves an explanation as to why a long time contributor was seemingly banned without just cause?
A simple could be given without revealing personal information so it seems strange that you won’t give one.
He's a user just like everyone else.
We don't go talking in open threads the nature of why we ban other users.
No special treatment is being given.
Seems like a lot of “special treatment” is given to ban 2 former mods on the same day?
To say he was a user like everyone else is a little bit of an understatement, no?
He was a heavy contributor to the sub and also a mod.
You can’t expect us to not want some kind of explanation as to why he was banished from the community.
Is, not was.
Just because he was a mod, I'm not treating him any better or any worse than any person on here.
We don't go make posts for every person that gets banned.
That is a waste of time.
If you want to know ask him why he was banned.
I am not discussing it at this time.
End of thread.

You are on a power trip, buddy.
From what I understand, you haven’t provided him or anyone with any proof of breaking rules, etc and it appears you have banned him in an attempt to cover something up.
You could simply say he broke a rule, but this looks shady as hell.
“End of thread” ok thought police.
Thought police?
No, I'm just done discussing it.
Have a good day.
As I stated, he deserves an explanation, and so far, he has not gotten one.
You are right, that you do not need to explain your self to all of us, just give u/Dong_Magnum a clear reason for being banned.
I'm not asking for a discussion.
I want you or one of the other mods to contact u/Dong_Magnum and explain to him what rule he broke, and how he broke it.
Reason was given to him.
And that's all I'm saying on the matter.
