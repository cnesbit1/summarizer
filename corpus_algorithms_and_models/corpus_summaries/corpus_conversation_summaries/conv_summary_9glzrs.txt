Original Response: 
So before I begin, I just have to make it clear I’m not a Christian, and this isn’t a Christian based argument.
My argument is that Jesus does not share any real similarities with pagan gods.
That the supposed similarities are later additions to these pagan god stories, and are largely just made up.
That’s not to say their aren’t some basic, vague similarities.
Jesus was a teacher, and other pagan gods also taught.
The similarity is inconsequential though as being a teacher is something many people are.
Jesus was also said to do miracles, and some pagan gods were miracle workers.
Again, the similarity is inconsequential as miracle workers were a dime a dozen during that time period.
To claim that those similarities mean anything would be akin to saying that I’m copied from Iron Man because I’m sarcastic and like technology.
When it comes down to it though, the story of Jesus is fully Jewish, and is not suggestive of being copied from any other story.
He differs widely from any pagan god, except for in very broad and vague terms.

Summary: 
Jesus was a teacher, and other pagan gods also taught.
