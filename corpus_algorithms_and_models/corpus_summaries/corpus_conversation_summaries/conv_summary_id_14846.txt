Easily one of my favorite redheads, and I love redheads.
I like her song too - ["Experience"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRBkpwlHtkA), though I understand how it's not everyone's taste.
Google leads me to an instagram account.
Can anyone tell me who she is?

I think just a model/singer.
Model, notably for American Apparel.Pretty sure Kanye West signed her as a singer too, she currently has one song out, "Experience" and reportedly has an album in the works.
which hopefully fails spectacularly so she has to go back to modeling.
She still models while making music, like a lot of people, hopefully she does well in both.
There is never a "weird place" on Reddit.
Nice mix and thanks for sharing!
She is so hot!EDIT: Just noticed you got downvoted, but I liked it and tried to balance you out ;)
