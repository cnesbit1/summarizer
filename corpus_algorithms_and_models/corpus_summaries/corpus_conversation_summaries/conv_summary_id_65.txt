It will always be number one in my heart though.
Not for activities though, I'm always trying to find groups to do things.
Surfing, kite surfing, wind surfing, SUP'ing, boating, kayaking, fishing, beaching, off-roading.
That's what you do here.
Oh and there a bunch of skate parks in town.Edit: http://www.c2h3.com/
I live in Corpus, I'm poor..
I do go fishing, and i got bored of the beach in my early 20's.
What about Hashing, have you tried that?
(link above) Maybe geocaching?
Ill have to look more in to hashing.
I had no idea that was a thing until right now.
Sort of like a drinking club with a running problem!
I'd be up for a drinking club without all that darn running...
Because there are no gyms here or beaches to run on or just land to stand on in general.
Air pushups!
