no thanks.
Hello!
Since OP isn't interested, how many codes are you looking for in exchange for the both?
Hey there, if you'd like, I'm able to do this trade!
I don't have either of them.

As in both of them for a KG and LL Code?
[deleted]
I can do this!
Do you have the wondercard or any proof for them?
[deleted]
That’s alright, I can still do the trade, and yeah if you could send that it’d be great.

Sounds good!
Trade completed and codes sent!
Thanks!
&gt; I have Kanto hat and Hoenn hat Ash Pikachu

&gt; OT ash

&gt; iD 090898 / 091303

&gt; Unfortunately not since I restarted the game when each new Pikachu released since it was once per game.
I do have the card for sinnoh Pikachu if you need proof

Hi /u/SonicSpeed0919,

To clarify, did you originally obtain both of these Pikachu yourself?
When offering valuable Pokemon, the origin information (see [Rule 3B](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_3_-_full_details_must_be_posted_for_valuable_pok.E9mon.))
needs to be made clear when you are first making your offer.
If they were obtained by yourself, that must be explicitly stated.
Please edit your comment above with this origin information and then reply here when you have done so.
Thank you!
Hello FizzixAP!
The Pokemon you traded for did not have the details required by [Rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_3_-_full_details_must_be_posted_for_valuable_pok.E9mon.).
Specifically, the origin information was not clearly stated in the initial offer.
In the future, please be more careful when trading for valuable Pokemon as you could have been traded something that violates our rules.
If you see any posts that are missing information, please report them and feel free wait for a moderator to handle the situation before initiating a trade with the user.
You are also welcome to [ask for details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/8w65vf/rule_change_ask_for_info_when_trading_valuable/) yourself if you are interested in initiating a trade.
I have asked the other user to get back to me regarding this origin information.
For now, please hold off on offering the Pikachu until I hear back.
Thank you for understanding!
Absolutely, I’ll hold off on it.
I remember realizing the origin wasn’t stated but I forget to ask :p

Just let me know!
