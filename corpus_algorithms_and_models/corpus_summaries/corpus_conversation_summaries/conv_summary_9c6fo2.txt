You're on r/sex, everything is normal here.
&gt; You aren’t a pedophile if you don’t abuse children


Just gonna step in to clarify that this is incorrect.
Pedophiles are people who are sexually attracted to children (you can get into specific terms depending on the age range, but for the purpose of keeping this simple the general term will just be ''pedophile'').
OP might be confusing her sexual desires and fantasies or she might be a pedophile, both are OK.
The important thing if you are the latter is to be aware of it and get help.
Being a pedophile in most countries isn't illegal, but **acting on these urges with a child is what turns you from a pedophile to a child abuser.

If OP or anyone is interested in knowing more in a short video format feel free to watch this TedTalk on the subject.

TL:DR: You can be a pedophile and not be a child abuser, being a pedophile DOES NOT mean you are automatically a child abuser.
