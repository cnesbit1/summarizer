Original Response: 
The Old Testament of the Bible, explicitly explains that JEHOVAH alone is GOD and noone else.
The New Testament of the Bible, explicitly explains that JEHOVAH alone is GOD and noone else.
The Old Testament of the Bible, promises a CHRIST would be born, of a virgin, of the line of David, of the root of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah.
In the New Testament of the Bible, this promised man was born.
This man was named JESUS by instruction of an angel of JEHOVAH GOD.
This man JESUS went on to prove himself to be the very CHRIST the old testament promised.
Who died and was resurrected by JEHOVAH GOD, and exalted to his right hand.
JESUS had the same God as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: JEHOVAH  
JESUS taught that JEHOVAH was our GOD.
JEHOVAH GOD taught that JESUS CHRIST was his Son and to listen to him.
Why are there so many people in the comments below, denying this basic truth?
Jesus is God.
Or do you hold that Jesus is really Michael the Archangel as the Witnesses say?
Jesus is Christ  
Jehovah is God  
Michael is the Archangel  


this is an open book test.
And according to the book, Jesus is God, per John 1:1, John 8:58, and the entirety of Scripture.
Jehovah is a mistranslated version of Yahweh.
:)
You quote John 8:58 where Jesus tells them Abraham was first, and he is indeed greater than Abraham.But you ignore 4 verses earlier where Jesus explicitly teaches them that he is not God.
## John 8:54 (edited)

## Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God.
What translation are you using?
Also, that's not the actual verse: 

Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!"
Exodus 3:14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am.
&gt; that's not the actual verse

You are right, i made a typo, my bad.
I was posting the verse 4 verses prior, where Jesus explicitly tells the Jews he isn't God  
How does Jesus stating, that Abraham was before, make Jesus God?
I am a fireman = the fireman is claiming to be God.
&gt; Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!"
thats not the verse either, youve added the word born.
thats a well known corruption.
&gt; How does Jesus stating, that Abraham was before, make Jesus God?
You misunderstand.
Jesus is saying that HE was before Abraham.
**John 8:58 Revised Standard Version (RSV):**

58 *Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.”*

Before Abraham, Jesus was.
"I am" is what God calls Himself.
The sentence makes no sense unless Jesus is making a reference to the God of Abraham who is "I am".
The Jews asked Jesus if he was greater than Abraham, he told them he was.
ego sum, is common language.
Before = First  
was = past  
I am = present.
&gt; Before = First  
&gt; was = past  
&gt; I am = present

Yeah okay I'm not an idiot.
Jesus is inferring that He was before Abraham.
Not hard to understand.
"I am" is the name of the God of Abraham.
beforebɪˈfɔː/*preposition, conjunction, &amp; adverb*preposition: **before**; conjunction: **before**; adverb: **before**

1. during the period of time preceding (a particular event or time).
2. in front of.
If you check your bible, you'll find that Abraham was first, then Moses, then Jesus.
Exodus 3:14  
dixit Deus ad Mosen **ego sum qui sum** ait sic dices filiis Israhel **qui est** misit me ad vos          


God's name is 'ego sum' or 'qui sum' or 'qui est' ?
You don't have to be sarcastic with your copy paste from the dictionary.
Also, I'm aware of when Abraham was born, however Christ was/is the Word of God who was before Abraham.
Christ being the Word made flesh is the beginning of the book of John.
You're reading one verse without anything else and making your conclusion instead of looking at the whole picture.
Genesis 1:1-5  
1 **In the beginning God** created the heaven and the earth.
2 And  the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of  the deep.
And the Spirit **of God** moved upon the face of the waters.
**3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
**  
4 **And God saw the light**, that it was good: **and God** divided the light from the darkness.
5 **And God called the light Day**, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day  


John 1:1-5  
1 **In the beginning was the Word**, and **the Word** was **with God,** and **the Word was God.
**  
2 **The same was in the beginning with God.
**  
3 **All things were made by him**; and **without him** was not any thing made that was made.
4 **In him was life**; and the life was **the light** of men.
5 And **the light** shineth in darkness; and **the darkness comprehended it not.
**                            
   
What is John trying to tell us?
Exactly what Genesis tells us.
That in the beginning was only God, and he created all things through his spoken word.
In his word was life and life was the light of men.
The Gospel of John starts off, making sure you understand that only God existed at the start and he created all things.
The darkness comprehended it not, so not everyone understands that.
Even without the word born, it still addresses the divinity of Jesus.
Regarding the Son’s prehuman existence, John says: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” (Joh 1:1, NW) The King James Version and the Douay Version read: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This would make it appear that the Word was identical with Almighty God, while the former reading, in the New World Translation, indicates that the Word is not the God, Almighty God, but is a mighty one, a god.
(Even the judges of ancient Israel, who wielded great power in the nation, were called “gods.” [Ps 82:6; Joh 10:34, 35]) Actually, in the Greek text, the definite article ho, “the,” appears before the first “God,” but there is no article before the second.
Other translations aid in getting the proper view.
The interlinear word-for-word reading of the Greek translation in the Emphatic Diaglott reads: “In a beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and a god was the Word.” The accompanying text of the Diaglott uses capital and small capital letters for the God, and initial capital and lowercase letters for the second appearance of “God” in the sentence: “In the Beginning was the LOGOS, and the LOGOS was with GOD, and the LOGOS was God.”

These renderings would support the fact that Jesus, being the Son of God and the one used by God in creating all other things (Col 1:15-20), is indeed a “god,” a mighty one, and has the quality of mightiness, but is not the Almighty God.
Other translations reflect this view.
The New English Bible says: “And what God was, the Word was.” The Greek word translated “Word” is Lo′gos; and so Moffatt’s translation reads: “The Logos was divine.” The American Translation reads: “The Word was divine.” Other readings, by German translators, follow.
By Böhmer: “It was tightly bound up with God, yes, itself of divine being.” By Stage: “The Word was itself of divine being.” By Menge: “And God (= of divine being) the Word was.” And by Thimme: “And God of a sort the Word was.” All these renderings highlight the quality of the Word, not his identity with his Father, the Almighty God.
Being the Son of Jehovah God, he would have the divine quality, for divine means “godlike.”—Col 2:9; compare 2Pe 1:4, where “divine nature” is promised to Christ’s joint heirs.
The Four Gospels—A New Translation, by Professor Charles Cutler Torrey, says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was god.
When he was in the beginning with God all things were created through him; without him came no created thing into being.” (Joh 1:1-3) Note that what the Word is said to be is spelled without a capital initial letter, namely, “god.”

This Word, or Lo′gos, was God’s only direct creation, the only-begotten son of God, and evidently the close associate of God to whom God was speaking when he said: “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.” (Ge 1:26) Hence John continued, saying: “This one was in the beginning with God.
All things came into existence through him, and apart from him not even one thing came into existence.”—Joh 1:2, 3.
Other scriptures plainly show that the Word was God’s agent through whom all other things came into existence.
There is “one God the Father, out of whom all things are, .
. .
and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are.” (1Co 8:6) The Word, God’s Son, was “the beginning of the creation by God,” otherwise described as “the firstborn of all creation; because by means of him all other things were created in the heavens and upon the earth.”—Re 3:14; Col 1:15, 16.
Acts 28: 6 ol King James the trinitarian leaves the definite article in, but leaves it our at John 1:1.
Regarding the Son’s prehuman existence, John says: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” (Joh 1:1, NW) The King James Version and the Douay Version read: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” This would make it appear that the Word was identical with Almighty God, while the former reading, in the New World Translation, indicates that the Word is not the God, Almighty God, but is a mighty one, a god.

First, can you establish why we should trust the NW translation and the Watchtower above the preceding Scripture translations?
“I am” isn’t his name.
God’s name is Yahweh, meaning “He that Causes Us to Exist” or something along these lines.
When God says it, he’s saying “I am that causes you to exist” or something along those lines.
Learn Hebrew.
All Hebrew names are just regular words like Adam, Baal, and El.
Yeshua didn’t say anything like that.
The above speaks for itself.
Can you establish why we should trust your translation of the preceding scripture, when despite the above, it's translators decided to buckle to peer pressure and tradition, rather then truth?
The above has some interesting arguments that I will address.
But First, I'd like to see a reason why we should trust a 19th century authority whose translation of the Bible never existed and whose sources contradict Christian truth.
Would you like to clarify which peer pressure and tradition you refer to?
Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead.
And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)
Matt.
20:20-23, RS: “The mother of the sons of Zebedee .
. .
said to him [Jesus], ‘Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.’ But Jesus answered, .
. .
‘You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’” (How strange, if, as claimed, Jesus is God!
Was Jesus here merely answering according to his “human nature”?
If, as Trinitarians say, Jesus was truly “God-man”—both God and man, not one or the other—would it truly be consistent to resort to such an explanation?
Does not Matthew 20:23 rather show that the Son is not equal to the Father, that the Father has reserved some prerogatives for himself?)
Matt.
12:31, 32, RS: “Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” (If the Holy Spirit were a person and were God, this text would flatly contradict the Trinity doctrine, because it would mean that in some way the Holy Spirit was greater than the Son.
Instead, what Jesus said shows that the Father, to whom the “Spirit” belonged, is greater than Jesus, the Son of man.)
John 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”

1 Cor.
11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ.
It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven.
So the truth here stated applies to the relationship between God and Christ in heaven.)
1 Cor.
15:27, 28 RS: “‘God has put all things in subjection under his [Jesus’] feet.’ But when it says, ‘All things are put in subjection under him,’ it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.
When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be everything to every one.”

The Hebrew word Shad·dai′ and the Greek word Pan·to·kra′tor are both translated “Almighty.” Both original-language words are repeatedly applied to Jehovah, the Father.
(Ex.
6:3; Rev.
19:6) Neither expression is ever applied to either the Son or the holy spirit.
Again, before I engage with your arguments, I'd like for you to engage mine regarding authority.
John 1:1, 2:  RS reads: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.” (KJ, Dy, JB, NAB use similar wording.)
However, NW reads: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.
This one was in the beginning with God.”

Which translation of John 1:1, 2 agrees with the context?
John 1:18 says: “No one has ever seen God.” Verse 14 clearly says that “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us .
. .
we have beheld his glory.” Also, verses 1, 2 say that in the beginning he was “with God.” Can one be with someone and at the same time be that person?
At John 17:3, Jesus addresses the Father as “the only true God”; so, Jesus as “a god” merely reflects his Father’s divine qualities.—Heb.
1:3.
Is the rendering “a god” consistent with the rules of Greek grammar?
Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, “The Word was God.” But not all agree.
In his article “Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,” Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in John 1:1, “with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning.
They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos.” He suggests: “Perhaps the clause could be translated, ‘the Word had the same nature as God.’” (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp.
85, 87) Thus, in this text, the fact that the word the·os′ in its second occurrence is without the definite article (ho) and is placed before the verb in the sentence in Greek is significant.
Interestingly, translators that insist on rendering John 1:1, “The Word was God,” do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb.
Thus at John 6:70, JB and KJ both refer to Judas Iscariot as “a devil,” and at John 9:17 they describe Jesus as “a prophet.”

John J. McKenzie, S.J., in his Dictionary of the Bible, says: “Jn 1:1 should rigorously be translated ‘the word was with the God [= the Father], and the word was a divine being.’”—(Brackets are his.
Published with nihil obstat and imprimatur.)
(New York, 1965), p. 317.
In harmony with the above, AT reads: “the Word was divine”; Mo, “the Logos was divine”; NTIV, “the word was a god.” In his German translation Ludwig Thimme expresses it in this way: “God of a sort the Word was.” Referring to the Word (who became Jesus Christ) as “a god” is consistent with the use of that term in the rest of the Scriptures.
For example, at Psalm 82:1-6 human judges in Israel were referred to as “gods” (Hebrew, ’elo·him′; Greek, the·oi′, at John 10:34) because they were representatives of Jehovah and were to speak his law

The New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century.
But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma.
Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol.
XIV, p. 299.
In The Encyclopedia Americana we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person].
The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one.
Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol.
XXVII, p. 294L.
&gt; The Gospel of John starts off, making sure you understand that only God existed at the start and he created all things.
The beginning of John is saying that the Word is with God, the Word is God.
It says the Word of God that is God became flesh!
That's very simple to grasp.
I meant what He called Himself, I didn't mean His actual name.
I'm aware that YHWH is His name.
I also didn't say that Christ said the tetragrammaton did I?
&gt; Learn Hebrew.
Eh, maybe after I learn koine Greek.
I know this was a sarcastic comment of yours, however.
 I'm so amazed that you can't reply with a simple answer to my questions.
I'll wait until you respond to the previous question.
:)
It actually wasn’t sarcasm.
Just because Yeshua said ego eimi it means he’s God.
Look in John 9, a lame dude said “ego eimi”.
Is he God?
I'm also going with what is said in John 1. :)

Anywho, agree to disagree about the Trinity!
God the Father alone, created all things, by himself, exactly like he says in the old testament, and confirmed by the new testament.
The word became flesh, because Jesus was born.
Begotten.
which part makes the claim that Jesus is the God of Israel (who is his Father)?
Sorry, can you be a little more specific?
Which part of what?
&gt; God the Father alone, created all things, by himself, exactly like he says in the old testament, and confirmed by the new testament.
The word became flesh, because Jesus was born.
Begotten.
You need to do some actual research.
*shakes her head*

Have a nice day.

Have a nice day!
All of scripture declares that Jesus is God.
the RCC is not scripture.
I wasn't referring to the RCC, but the 66 books of the bible.
the 66 books of the bible, declares JEHOVAH is God, and Jesus is the Christ.
Considering that the name that Jesus was given at birth literally means "God with us", proves your position to be wrong.
But, clearly, you don't want to hear that (based on your other comments).
So I shall bid you good day.
Good day.
It would seem your appropriating a name meaning to a person.
Before Jesus himself was born there was born another named Jesus.
who was the son of Eliezer, but we don't assume he is God just because his name was Jesus do we?
&amp;#x200B;

The scriptures do not say in plain text that Jesus is god, in fact the opposite Jesus himself says in your bible that the Father is greater than he is.
&amp;#x200B;

Father(God) &gt; Jesus Christ(Son)

I understand it can be difficult to comprehend new bible truths, especially ones that contradict what you have learned growing up.
But in order to grow in your relationship with God you need to be able to take a honest look at the scriptures without applying 3rd party notions to it, and let the context of the following and preceding scriptures assist you in understanding.
That being said it doesn't mean you will understand it.
The bible explains that fact that not everyone is rightly disposed for everlasting life, and some are not drawn by God and will not have the authority to grasp the scriptures true meaning and will remain that way.
That is also why Jesus celebrated that God allowed his disciples to understand.

&gt;I understand it can be difficult to comprehend new bible truths, especially ones that contradict what you have learned growing up.
Not really, it's easy to spot falsehoods, like the position that Jesus is not God.
Jesus is God, all of scripture declares this, he is not the archangel Michael.
Reject this, placing your faith in a false Christ, means that a person is not saved.
So lets examine the scriptures!
Luke 22:41,42 - 41 And he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw away, and he bent his knees and began to pray, 42 Saying: “Father, if you want to, remove this cup from me.
Nevertheless, let, not my will, but yours take place.”

So here Jesus went to pray and in his prayer he mentioned exactly who he was praying to, his Father(God) and continues to say to his Father(God) Let not me will(Jesus' Will the will of the Son) Take place but yours(God's will the Father).
If Jesus were god he would have no need to pray because he himself would be god and it would impossible.
It would be like asking yourself for $5 and thinking you would gain $5 and have $10, but in reality you asked yourself and gave yourself your own $5 and still only have $5 making what you did pointless.
Which is exactly what would be the case if Jesus were God and prayed to himself it would have been of no gain.
Jesus didn't pray to himself, he prayed to God the Father.
This doesn't change anything, Jesus is still God.
Your cult has misguided you and led you astray.
So he indeed prayed to someone separate from himself, that you agree with.
Why is it that you assign him to be the same person as the Father then?
Seperate and at the same time, the same.
God is not human, and cannot be fully understood by humans, so stop trying to.
Also, stop trying to say something that scripture doesn't back up.
When I read the scriptures it plainly says exactly what I am saying and the characters in the bible due to.
The notion that he would create something illogical and confusion doesn't coincide with his nature or qualities.
There is no benefit to claiming or wanting Christ to also be God himself, nor would it be necessary for the Almighty to be 3 People.
He is sufficient enough in power and right.
Otherwise the bible would say in the beginning the Father, the Son and the Holy spirit created all had the same  idea at the same time and created the heavens and the earth.
A son is not greater than a father nor are they equal.
That is why the scriptures say God does things for the Son because it is necessary.
Otherwise the Son would have no use for the Father.
Get a better translation that the absolute junk one that the Jehovah's witnesses us.
The NASB for example, which is regarded as one of the most accurate English word for word translations.
Read it plainly, see that Jesus is God.
I read the KJV and NIV both are in harmony with what the NWT says in fact every bible is, I have one question for you.
If what you believe is actually wrong would you still believe in it?
&gt;I read the KJV and NIV both are in harmony with what the NWT 

Really?
John 1

(KJV) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God

(Niv) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God

(Nasb) In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
(NWT)  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was **a** god

Uh oh- they don't all agree.
The NWT added the "a" to support its non-trinatrain viewpoint

Edit - to put this in perspective the 1600 year old [codex sianticus](http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=36)  has the same rendering of John 1 as the KJV, niv, and nasb.
The NWT is simply incorrect.
If what you believe is actually wrong would you still believe in it?
No I wouldn't, would you?

Summary: 
**  
2 **The same was in the beginning with God.
"I am" is the name of the God of Abraham.
The beginning of John is saying that the Word is with God, the Word is God.
"I am" is what God calls Himself.
All of scripture declares that Jesus is God.

JEHOVAH GOD taught that JESUS CHRIST was his Son and to listen to him.
:) I believe when God is referred to it means the Trinity.
Jesus is inferring that He was before Abraham.
which part makes the claim that Jesus is the God of Israel (who is his Father)?
Christ being the Word made flesh is the beginning of the book of John.
However, NW reads: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.
Otherwise the Son would have no use for the Father.
who was the son of Eliezer, but we don't assume he is God just because his name was Jesus do we?
&gt; How does Jesus stating, that Abraham was before, make Jesus God?
the 66 books of the bible, declares JEHOVAH is God, and Jesus is the Christ.
What translation are you using?
John 1:1, 2:  RS reads: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
Even without the word born, it still addresses the divinity of Jesus.
This man was named JESUS by instruction of an angel of JEHOVAH GOD.
This doesn't change anything, Jesus is still God.
No I wouldn't, would you?
Exodus 3:14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am.
**3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
In his word was life and life was the light of men.
The above has some interesting arguments that I will address.
If Jesus were god he would have no need to pray because he himself would be god and it would impossible.
