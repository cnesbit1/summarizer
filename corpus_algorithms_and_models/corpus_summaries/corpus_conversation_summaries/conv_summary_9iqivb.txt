Can someone who is good with TA explain how can you predict the whole market when price is different on exchanges.
It may cross your line on one exchange but not on other exchange.
I think most people use the bigger exchanges like bitfinex for TA.
I ignore the smaller ones.
Even in the bigger ones highs and lows differ by few dollars.
Whats even more interesting is how on one exchange a particular price move has more significant volume than on others.
Im comparing 2 exchanges in minute scale and binance has bigger volume spikes when price goes up but OKEx has bigger spikes when price goes down.
You just choose an exchange (preferably one with high volume) and trade according to what your TA says for that exchange.
In most cases the TA pattern will also happen on the other exchanges sooner or later anyway (because the price differences are very small) and the few times it doesn't your TA signal should still be good enough to give you an edge.
TA is pretty much the astrology of trading.
You might as well just try to predict the market with astrology.
You'll have the same result, once in a while you will be lucky and get a prediction right.
And the more vague your prediction, the easier it's gonna be to make it sound right.
I dont agree with the whole idea of TA.
If TA works then that means you can predict a pattern without understanding its cause, just by similarity with previous patterns.
No-one is good with TA where Bitcoin is concerned I'm afraid.
what if you could predict if a dump has been finished or going to dump more by just comparing volume on largest exchanges.
Well TA should be based on some kind of logic behind it and not just on some kind of magic caused by the signal itself (in my opinion).
It's just a tool to easily identify market sentiment and more easily identify turning points.
The most important thing to figure out is when to use it cause you cant just blindly pop up a chart, put your favorite TA in it and start trading.

For example during the hype period last year the herd behaviour of the masses was pretty easy exploitable with TA because this caused clear trends in the crypto's which could be exploited with TA.
I traded pretty much everyday on the short term and made consistent profits doing so.
Then the turning point came and the crashes started to happen which caused a change in TA strategy to be made but still buying the dips of these crashes could be exploited using TA.
After that the masses left and volume and volatily just went to much down for me and i pretty much stopped trading the crypto markets.
Now im just waiting for another hype period to happen to start following trends again or a big crash to buy the dip.
.. then everyone would do it - or be doing it :)
Thats like saying that if working hard would make you money then everyone would be doing it.

You use the exchange with the most volume as all other exchanges will generally (but not always) follow suit.
To be fair, Tone's proven much of the market wrong since early this year as he has been the contrarian bear that's been right waaaaaay longer than many wanted him to be, myself included.
[deleted]
No it's not.
In other words, just because something can be done and will make you money doesn't mean that everyone will do it.
And according to volumes that I just compared on different exchanges I predict that this few day dump is over and you should not sell but buy instead.
Here's an anecdotal tip.
When this shit is doing badly, Bitcoin prevails:

1 Bcash = ฿0.067 (2 s.f.)
I wish it would die quicker and get it over with.

Don't be silly.
Go ahead.

Price isn’t significantly different on exchanges since prices are determined by mid market price.
As for peer to peer trading (no exchange), prices can be all over the place.
Because it has been a confusing diversion in the growth of crypto since its inception.
When it finally dies, this technology can move forward.

Fine.
Philosophise away :)

But Bcash dying is a good thing for all cryptocurrencies.
everyone keeps talking about "TA"

what does "TA" mean?
this one for example https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9b6aFJjyqk.

Shill away RogerCoiner.
TA is short for technical analysis.
[deleted]
thanks!
:)
&gt;Even for BCH, lower price+rushing/confused newbies "yummi"

Trading Bitcoin is stupid.
Trade stocks.
Acquire BTC.

I always thought TA stood for transsexual ass.
Damn was that totally off on that one haha... but seriously how do you know not know TA is technical analysis?
In the Bitcoin world, a TA can mean virtually anything including as simple as “up” or “short” or even “Lambo.” You will find most TAs in this subreddit being a 1 word analysis like “moon” or “hodl” or “fud.”.
on a small uptrend.
well TA is just part of data need to determine the best trade.
you need more like news, latest development to come out with the logic behind the chart.

Summary: 
TA is pretty much the astrology of trading.
TA is short for technical analysis.
