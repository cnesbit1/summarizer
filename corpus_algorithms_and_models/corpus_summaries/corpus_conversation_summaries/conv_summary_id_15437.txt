Ah yes.
These are definitely real things she does.
Not at all just pandering.
TIL why girls have self-esteem issues.
I love a hot girl as much as the next person, but This really isn't cool.
Who's to say what the "perfect" girlfriend is?
I'm sure she might do these things occasionally (probably in sweat pants and a real shirt) but beer, pizza and candy on a normal basis.... No she doesn't.
Her diet is probably more specifically strict than the rules of chess.
She's playing Bloodborne.
Man.
This really made me cringe.
Though, the video wouldn't be such a turn-off if she were wearing a realistic outfit... (That, and if the controller was turned on.
)But the fact that she actually is a gamer makes up for it.
I can tell you one thing, the perfect girlfriend wouldn't be drinking bud light.

Summary: 
These are definitely real things she does.
