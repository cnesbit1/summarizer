Disembowelled by a cassowary.
Euthanasia implies it’s voluntary.
The word you’re looking for is “execution”.
Still agree with the sentiment.

I am also in favour of the death penalty being restored in Australia.

Putting aside whether or not animal abuse should be a death sentence - and you might convince me it should...
This is the *type* of case where I'd support the death penalty - in the sense that there's objective evidence of the crime.
My problem with the death penalty is innocent people might get killed - but I'd accept a death penalty if it required evidence stronger than *"beyond all reasonable doubt"* - specifically I want some type of objective unbiased record, such as filming the crime in action.
