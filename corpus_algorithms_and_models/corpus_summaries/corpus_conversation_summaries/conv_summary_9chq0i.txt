Original Response: 
Friendly reminder to people who aren't aware - golliwogs as they appear now were originally American, from the children's books by American author Florence Upton.
The appearance of the character of "Golliwog" was based on "Negro rag dolls", and his clothes and "beastly creature in a posh suit" schtik are based on cruel blackface caricatures in minstrel shows still popular at the time (late 1800s).
Our Mums and Nanas almost certainly didn't know that when they knitted us our toy gollies.
We thought they were just kinda abstract people from Noddy like elves and bears.
So, the accusations of racism do sometimes feel a little unfair.
But the people that would rather see them retired from production and sale are completely correct that the designs are, and always have been racial caricatures of African/African American people.

&gt;1800's, Egyptian workers wore the letters W.O.G.S signifying that they were Working On Government Service.
I believe that's a false etymology.
Yeah that's not true.

The history of language is weird full stop.
I read this exact story on a little booklet attached to one of the dolls.
I just spent a minute verifying it, and apparently it's completely fabricated.

Yeah people have been saying shit and fuck for millennia just in different forms.
If you have to remind people why they are outraged then it's a good chance that it's a non event and just the professionally outraged at it again.
It's more about the groups who vocally oppose this being correct about things that are very often doubted and dismissed as an exaggeration.
Nah.
Ignorance of racism doesn't excuse it.
It just makes you ignorant and racist.
no.
And making unsubstantiated personal attacks like that is what nazi's do.
And I block nazi's.
goodbye.
no.
And making unsubstantiated personal attacks like that is what nazi's do.
