Original Response: 
For example, if you believe torturing someone for fun is objectively immoral, could you provide a sound argument that that is actually the case?
I would argue that this is actually impossible because you would first have to show that everyone should act according to moral standards, whatever source they may come from.
By this I mean you would have to account for the following statements: 1) everyone should never do something that is immoral, and 2) everyone should, to their best ability, attempt to do the things that are moral.
In other words: why should anyone care about any moral standards?
Since what is described above is actually a moral standard in itself, claiming that you should adhere to it would result in an infinite regress.
