Original Response: 
Aberfoyle is a small community outside of Guelph which had 50% of it's groundwater purchased by Nestle.
Typically, there are time requirements before a new contract is signed in order to rebalance the water table.
However, the Ontario Wynne government approved Nestle for a permit to extract 3.6 million litres of water daily (early).

I am asking for /r/Canada to raise awareness and support (starting within our own online community) for laws protecting our fresh water resources from corporation and encouraging sustainability.
&amp;#x200B;

With the election next year, it is valuable to start raising awareness now.
Due to Maxime Bernier splitting the Conservative vote, it it likely that the Liberals will win another term.
Therefore, if we can encourage the Liberal (or NDP) party to use this as a key platform issue, we can begin making strides towards protecting our resources.
3.6 million L/day isn't much relative to municipalities' daily groundwater extraction, although I don't think we should be helping bottled water thrive as an industry.
I bet plastic bottled water will be illegal in the next few decades.
Water bottle eco-tax would help discourage people from buying bottled water.
I'm not typically for eco-taxes or enviro-bans, but bottled water is a ridiculous practice in Canada.
Doug Ford may even be for this cause due to the massive expense of waste burden and low revenue in exchange for the natural resource.
no it wouldn't.
They would complain and still by the bottles.
There are areas of Ontario that needs the bottled water but the cities 99% of the time don't.
Doesn't Ontario have a bottle deposit?
BC does.
5 cents doesn't do shit.
Negative.
They get trashed.
It would also subsidize source water protection efforts.
Excluding some troubled First Nation Reserves, what parts of Ontario require bottled water?
In addition to the highest quality of drinking water treatment and monitoring, Ontario has the largest supply of fresh water in the world!
How much is it now?
people that depend on well water or have poor well's depend on bottled water.
Sulphur water is horrible tasting and even worse to cook with.
Subsidizing water protection, research, and monitoring is always a good thing to put money into.
Well, then, there's a solution.
It will be part of a multi-faceted solution, for sure.
Well water is the cleanest water source and generally doesn't need any treatment.

That sulfur smell is often from hydrogen-sulfide producing bacteria.
The local Public Health Unit can test your water and advise the best solution depending mostly on pH ([free service](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/ServicesAndTools/LaboratoryServices/Pages/Water-Testing-SubmitASample.aspx)).

* Activated charcoal/carbon filters are cheap (whole-house filter for $110 at Crappy Tire) and instantly remove odours and organic compounds.
* Disinfecting the well with chlorine or ozone or even hydrogen-peroxide will kill the bacteria.
* Hot water tanks can also chemically produce sulfides when using mineral-rich ground water sources.
I live in BC.
West Kelowna has had a water advisory since I have been here.
We buy and drink bottled water, even though we have an enormous fresh water lake.
Really?!
That sucks!
How is this not national news?
&amp;#x200B;

Ontario had a tragic incident where a whole town was poisoned by municipal water.
Now we have the most stringent and comprehensive standards.

Summary: 
Doesn't Ontario have a bottle deposit?
Well, then, there's a solution.
They would complain and still by the bottles.
