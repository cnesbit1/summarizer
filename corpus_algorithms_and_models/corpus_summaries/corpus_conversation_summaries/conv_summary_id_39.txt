I'm moving out in May and my roommates would probably rather get a new roommate than have to move.
PM me if you can wait til May/ or are interested.
Are you needing a place to move into or you have a place and need a roommate?
Just curious, what do you do?
I too work in a hospital here!
Op, I'm not downtown I'm off Ennis but I need someone to take over my lease asap, I just graduated.
You could move in asap, i've got a roommate, and it's fairly cheap.
Plus, you wouldn't have to pay deposits.
Pm me if you're interested.

Summary: 
Pm me if you're interested.
