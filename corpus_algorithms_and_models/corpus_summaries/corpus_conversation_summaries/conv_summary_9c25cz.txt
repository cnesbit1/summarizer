Thanks for all the debate guys, has been very informative and troll free.
Happy scienceing.
I did some work on this back in grad school, outside of stem though.
The theory back in the 1990s was that even a limited nuclear war could cause a nuclear winter.
I think the problem is how people define "nuclear winter" It is actually a temporary dramatic shift in world climate that will eventually subside, after several years.

I would love to hear thought from anyone in the field.
I have not come across anything to really dispute the above.

I’d define it the same 
It’s just like volcanic or impact winters, temporary cooling effect.
When the particulates settle the cooling stops
Radiation is obviously a big sting in the tail though.

As long as they keep the detonations to airburst it shouldn't be a big problem.
It's the ground and near-ground detonations that are the real kicker.
That will add more dust alright, but it will likely make fire less likely by costing flammable materials in debris and rock.
I am saying that for more radiation you need to have contact with more stuff.
Airburst detonations are in a way cleaner because they don't deposit the radioactive particles directly.
Yeah exactly 
Airbirsts are also cleaner because the fireball doesn’t touch down, so there is basically no vaporised soil being filled with radioactive particles.
Exactly, as was my initial point when I was answering about the radiation.
While this is slightly off topic, there is evidence that the entire concept of "Nuclear Winter" was a facet in the Soviet propaganda campaign to take advantage of the peace movement in the west.
Not that there wasn't a possibility of a cooling event from a large amount of dust thrown into the atmosphere, but that even in the largest nuclear exchange, you are likely orders of magnitude below the energy that would be necessary to cause a large change in atmospheric dust levels.
Leading credence to this was the disappearance of one of the initiators of the theory in 1985, Vladimir Alexandrov.
Granted, some of his research went on to aid in our modern understanding of global climate changes.
This seems like an interesting avenue to explore alright.
[removed]
Do you have any sources for this claim?
As far as I can recall, the concept of a nuclear winter was first articulated by Carl Sagan et al in 1983, at a time when the peace movement was significantly smaller than in the 60s and 70s.
[removed]
[removed]
A lot of it was substantiated by a defected Soviet intelligence officer named Sergei Tretyakov in the 2000s in his book *Comrade J: The Untold Secrets of Russia's Master Spy in America After the End of the Cold War*.
TIME magazine was running [articles alluding to](https://web.archive.org/web/20070930040755/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,960025,00.html) such things back in the 1980s.
The Sagan stuff was part of the supposed influence that the Soviets had over the, at the time nascent peace movement in the late 1940s and 1950s, from which Sagan came out.
From my reading of these events, the idea was to cause a rift between the scientific community and the burgeoning national labs which were focused on nuclear weapons development and required a large deal of cooperation with the physics community to keep the research going.
I came across a lot of this information when I was studying nuclear proliferation and other issues in college.
I've thought more about it now, as it shows that there was a historical precedence to the alleged events surrounding the 2016 election.
We all die 
But we feel better about it.
I did in a separate reply.
There is a lot of circumstantial evidence.
However, there is enough to at least see it as a more likely possibility than an actual nuclear winter scenario.
The DoD released a [paper on the subject](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a200062.pdf) in 1987.
A key takeaway in the summery was:

 

&gt;The nuclear winter hypothesis has attracted increased attention in the scientific community over the past five years.
The research has advanced to  the state that, in spite of remaining uncertainties, there is a consensus of plausibility for the hypothesis and for the impact such an effect would have on the earth's environment.
The validity of this "nonissue" has increased to the point that the emotional aspects of the horrors of a nuclear war are now given additional credence by scientific research.
The dilemma of the issue is that the "guidance" offered by scientific information has many interpretations on how best to keep the world safe from nuclear war.
Further, the paper talks about the propaganda value of idea becoming more important than the idea itself; effectively that that discussing the horrors of nuclear war was a method of deterrence and that the more open western media allowed for that to have a greater impact on the populations there than in the Soviet sphere.
So it basically alludes to the concept being a small kernel of possibility vastly inflated to political ends.

The nuclear winter idea in the West clearly originated separate from any serious Soviet influence (it has its own intellectual trajectory), and the work that has been done on it since then has been largely independent of Soviet theories and data (the originators of the theory were appropriately wary of relying on anything coming out the USSR).
Did the Soviets use it as a facet of their propaganda?
Sure.
They also used Civil Rights as part of their propaganda as well, but that doesn't undermine the reality of it.
Both the USA and USSR promoted theories or arguments that promoted their overall diplomatic/ideological goals during the Cold War, often through clandestine sources.
One should not confuse promotion with creation, or let it by itself "taint" the underlying work.
You should be aware that the "nuclear winter is Soviet propaganda" argument is itself a holdover of propaganda from people who were resisting the argument that nuclear winter implied that the desired arms build-ups in the 1980s were suicidal.
(So you're engaging with another form of propaganda in repeating it, ironically.)
There have been many nuclear winter studies over the last 30 years, by many different groups, using many different models, and many different assumptions.
They get different results, like all scientific modeling of complex phenomena.
Some suggest nuclear winter effects are likely, some indicate they are not.
It may be that everybody involved has some political stake in the results (it's hard not to), but the idea that it's some kind of cheap conspiracy is about as plausible as the similar ideas propagated by climate change denialists.
The initial TTAPS work was rather crude compared to the full climate simulations that people (both pro and con) are using today.
Science marches on, though the scale of the problem is large enough that total certainty is likely to remain elusive for a long time yet.
For a very good history of nuclear winter by a serious historian of science, see Lawrence Badash, _A Nuclear Winter's Tale_.
Please also be aware that former Soviet intelligence agents _love_ to inflate their role in things, and all such accounts need to be read with a grain of salt.
Also it had the effect of reducing investment in civil defence measures as it was commonly seen as "pointless" (see Redditors in the present day scoffing at duck and cover drills)

Meanwhile in the USSR much greater measures were taken and in times of heightened tension this would give the Soviets more room to maneuver while the West less so.

I don't think that's quite true.
At the height of the cold war they had tens of thousands of missiles, each carrying multiple warheads.
There was a lot more than now.
They wouldn't have all reached their targets at the same time instead they would be falling and reinforcing the effects of the warheads detonated earlier.
Thus inputting more energy into the dust and ash clouds forming.
It probably would not have frozen Earth solid as claimed by some but global cooling would have been on a level where only the tropical and subtropical locations would have been warm enough to grow crops.
And considering how much radiation there would be floating all around I doubt a lot of plant life would survive.
All in all even if they were using the scenario to make more people less willing to use nuclear weapons that is a good thing.
If they were telling people a possible side-effect of the world going to nuclear war.
People got scared and wanted the chance of war to be less.
That is a good thing.
&amp;#x200B;

Also all of the things that Tretyakov said are claims by him only.
There is no collaboration with any trusted sourced.
Considering he worked in the SVR decades after the things he claimed happened I doubt he actually would have gain access to such documents in the first place.

I second this.
Soviets had more conventional forces in Europe so they published paper after paper that supported MAD theory.
It depends on where the nuke went off.
Soot definitely can cause catastrophic climate changes as seen in the eruption of mount Jambora.
But these simulations were based on the soot released by Hiroshima.
The concrete of Europe and the US would be different to the wood of Hiroshima.
Its less flammable, and unless forests were specifically targeted, I doubt there would be enough soot to cause a nuclear winter.
&gt;propaganda 

Perhaps.
But, if a large volcanic eruption can cause a measurable global cooling, then theoretically, a nuclear exchange (which would potentially be 10's or 100's of warheads) should cause a significant cooling of the earth.
Whether that is a catastrophic cooling, I dont think anyone can say for certain.

A lot of people are saying that a nuclear winter is a debatable and questionable event.
My follow up is this then:

Is there a 100% factual event or problem that could arise from, for example, a nuclear war that isn't a nuclear winter?
The contamination of the basically entire troposphere with varying levels of fissile radiation.
A nuclear winter is much more about the smoke and particulate matter arising from continually burning cities and industrial sights.
No one will be around to put out the fires, and firestorms will rage on and on, perhaps from most cities in a huge number of countries, USA, Russian, China, UK, France, India, Pakistan, Israel, Iran, etc.
The radiation will be the least of humanity's concerns after that!
We don’t really know if a destroyed modern city will even burn though... largely concrete and steel.
[removed]
[removed]
Bearing in mind: there will be nobody to put out the fires!
Any fire that exists will die on its own accord, or simply rage and feed into other fires, and there will still be huge landscapes awash in flames, and even when the fires eventually go out, there will be smoke rising from the hot embers for who knows how long.
Think of how long the 9/11 WTC site was emitting noxious smoke from beneath the collapsed buildings.
I live in NYC and most of the city’s buildings are not modern steel and concrete skyscrapers, it’s largely wood framed houses, brick townhouses and high rises, and many areas were built from 1880-1950.
The FDNY exists for a reason.

Assume all the major metro areas and industrial centers got nuked.
1.
At least a third of the population has just died.
Probably about half of the young adult population, conservatively.
Populations will decline further in the short term before they can start to recover.
2.
The infrastructure and logistics support to distribute food and supplies is probably completely inoperable.
You're suck surviving on things that can be produced locally for a long while.
3.
The power is probably out.
It will probably stay that way because the people that know how to run a large power grid were probably based in a city.
4.
Most highly specialized knowledge in general is probably lost within a generation or so, as those types of activities are concentrated in urban areas, and require huge amounts of time to learn (on equipment that was just vaporized), which can't be spared because trying to survive is a full time job.
Worst case scenario, you basically have to redo the entire industrialization process, with the benefit of a few modern tools and some general knowledge about how it turns out.
Take a look at Tsar Bomba, 50mt yield.
And that wasn't even enough to cause even local atmospheric pollution or any other sort of long lasting effects that don't include radiation.
I would venture a guess that it would take orders of magnitudes more than even 50mt.
You're realistically looking at several thousands, if not tens of thousands of megatons in yield to accomplish nuclear winter.
I would even venture to guess that there isn't enough nuclear weaponry to accomplish it.
Damage scales with a lesser power of yield, it’s non linear 

50,000 1kt nukes is a LOT more damage.
But I agree, we probably don’t have the oomph to accomplish it.
It's been pretty much universally agreed upon in the nuclear community that the intersection of the power curve you're talking about is right around 50mt.
They had originally planned to make it 100mt, but up one calculating it, realized they are wasting a lot of the energy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon_yield

To date, we've tested almost 51,000mt worth of nuclear devices.
I really think "nuclear winter" is a product of science fiction novels and movies.
I don't even think detonating every nuclear device on the planet currently and simultaneously would do the trick either.
Yeah, maybe if we set ourselves to the task and intentionally made weapons for it, otherwise I’m doubtful.
Also the limit of 50mt is the yield above which all you do is send more air into space.
&gt; Also the limit of 50mt is the yield above which all you do is send more air into space

It's actually more about the weight to yield ratio and the altitude at which the device will detonate.
All nuclear explosions are spherical and generated above the target.
No matter what your yield is, you will always have a spherical detonation that is sending X coefficent downwards (towards target) and Y coefficent upwards (away from target).
For sake of easy math, lets assume it's a 50/50 split.
I know it's not, but that's not important to explaining the theory.
Now, there's an ideal altitude at which will take the 50% of that energy traveling outwards and *down towards the target* and distribute it to maximum effect on the target.
Bombs with a yield greater than 50mt require a detonation altitude which is inefficient for damaging targets on the ground.
(IE; you have to detonate a 100mt bomb so high that it will achieve the same destruction as a 50mt bomb detonated at a lower altitude) 

They will both have the same damage on the target, the only difference being it's much more efficient and cost savings to build a 50mt bomb to do the same thing as a 100mt bomb.
&gt; is send more air into space

That hurts my head just reading.
Air doesn't get "sent into space" energy is just directed upwards into the atmosphere where there's no targets and it gets dispersed.
This is something that happens with all nuclear devices because of the spherical explosion.
It all stays inside the atmosphere.
Well yes, the angle of destructive force will get more acute as the radius increases.
But the shockwave does send a lot of air into space, still inside the upper atmosphere, but I’m considering space to be the point at which the shockwave becomes irrelevant due to the rarity of the air.
Obviously the thermal pulse does too.
But I’m getting at the same point as you... most of the energy in the downward and all of the energy in the upward region of the sphere is wasted.
The only portion of the blast that is applying its energy usefully is a small ring of the emitted pulse/blast, aiming at the regions where destruction is only moderate.
This would obviously get thinner with greater yield as this critical target region got further way.
&gt; air into space

dude, you really need to stop saying this.
that is not at all what happens.
no air "goes into space" that is not possible.
Take a balloon, inflate it half way and seal it.
Grab the inflated part of the baloon and start squeezing it.
Notice how you just move a pocket of air around *inside the balloon*?
That's what happens with a nuclear detonation.
It just gets moved around within the atmosphere.
Remember, we're talking about an explosion occurring a mile or less above the surface.
The explosion does not "push air into space" that is still around 65 miles above where the explosion took place.
Please stop saying that.
It really makes you sound uneducated.
&gt; Well yes, the angle of destructive force will get more acute as the radius increases.
Exactly.
Which should explain to you exactly why it's better to use a 50mt yield that can achieve the same effect as a 100mt yield.
There's no reason to build and detonate a 100mt bomb, when a 50mt bomb (does the exact same thing)

I think that's the misconception here.
You think that the 100mt bomb *does less damage* than the 50mt bomb, but it's actually *the same damage* which makes the 50mt bomb a more efficient option.
&gt; I’m considering space to be the point at which the shockwave becomes irrelevant due to the rarity of the air.
The shockwave dissipates well before it reaches even halfway to the upper atmosphere.
Remember, the upper limit of the atmosphere is still some 60 miles or so ABOVE the explosion.
I know the 100Mt won’t do less, that’s silly.
Will do marginally more, could probably do a rough calculation of it.
But I wouldn’t say more than 10% more.
What if I don’t want a complete winter.
I simply want to counter the effects of global warming.
I want global 1950s temperatures.
&gt; I simply want to counter the effects of global warming.
You're already wrong.
There's no way to "counter" global warming.
At this point we can only adapt.
[removed]
Volcanic eruptions that spew out some sulphur compound results in cooling.
Same would happen if we did it...

Summary: 
That's what happens with a nuclear detonation.
The power is probably out.
There was a lot more than now.
