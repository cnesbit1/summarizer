"Labor split the vote by running their own candidate in the seat.

"...into the ground"
Now to distance ourselves from this whole selling business, we've decided to simply give it away..... infact we'll pay someone to take it off our hands!
The bloody unions forced us to, the criminals!
"The boat people are trying to sell the country, however.
Until we took the front of their boat off."
"But it's fine because they were towed outside the environment"
"This message authorised by Shenhua Watermark, spoken by the Liberal Party".
But Labor ran a better campaign and did what the community wanted.
Damn unions /s.
I bet they'll say Labor are busy "playing politics"
