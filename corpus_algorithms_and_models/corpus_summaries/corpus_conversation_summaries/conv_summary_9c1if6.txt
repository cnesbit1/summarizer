Just want to say, that's a lot of fucking paint and a lot of weight(32 lbs per sideish?).
He was definitely sexist, but my jaw world totally drop if I saw that too.
I dead lift.
I also sell a shit ton of paint and my uniform is really loose fitted so it hides my muscles.
Its always funny to disprove a stereotype.
I need to get some goats so I can say my husband is at home with the kids.
Ya know goats are great for ‚Äúmowing your yard‚Äù.
That‚Äôs a practical reason to allow you to get them.
And they taste better than any other meat if fed properly.
I'll run it by my apartment complex!
My boss does something similar.
When we unload stuff from his car he tells me to get the light things.
Usually I just grab two bags of 6 pack 1.5L cokes (so a total of 18 Litres) and he always goes ‚Äúwoah you strong.‚Äù 
I hate when men think just because you‚Äôre a girl you can‚Äôt carry your own weight.
I have customers tell me that because I‚Äôm a girl I shouldn‚Äôt be working in a shop by myself.
I can tell you now that anyone who‚Äôs ever tried stealing whilst I‚Äôve been working has either stumbled out the shop a shaking wreck or never come back.
I also grew up playing tag teams with my 2 older brothers.
So I can definitely fight a man.
They‚Äôd rather mow the shrubs than your yard at least in my experience(have 3 goats).
‚ÄúHoney, will you mow the lawn today?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, no problem‚Äù

Deploys goats.
And they'd rather mow your neighbours' shrubs than your own.
Source: had goats.
It's really not that impressive.
If she weighs 165 lb which is the average weight for the American woman that's less than half her body weight.
I guess it's impressive for the average American Woman.
I would've given her a nod before I got in my f250 super duty.
That nod is usually reserved for people doing real work.

Deadlifts are the shit.
How much you dead lift.
Sheep are good for the yard.
Goats are good for brush.
OP could have her own landscaping business if she got both!
Same.
I am also super impressed with OP regardless of gender.
That's not an OSHA approved weight...
But it's SO worth it sometimes.
Also, yay jobs that involve free lunges.
well, water weighs about 8 lbs a gallon, and paint may be heavier.
Still, 64 lbs on a little wire bailer aint no joke.
I mean no offense!
But I figure you ought to know this: that comment  makes you come off as an incredible douchebag.
I'm not saying you *are* a douchebag.
But that comment certainly presents the image of one.
If you weren't going for that, it might be something to work on.
Yeah, more than the weight, I was thinking about those little cutty handles.
Ouch!
Hands of steel.

You're a good dude!
Check his comment history though... pretty sure he's going for douchebag.
This was a super respectful comment to someone who came off as a super douche.
Good job dude üëç.
I was the same at a take away job I worked at.
It was run by a bunch of brothers that hired me as front of shop.
Deliveries came in one day when it was quiet and I saw one of the smaller dudes struggling with a large bag of cabbages, so without warning I took it from him, then went back for the large bags of onions and flour.
Shut them up very fast.
I'm 5'5" and very slight but I grew up living a farm lifestyle and did numerous sports that I always excelled at (swimming, gymnastics, horse riding).
The brothers were skinny dudes that smoked constantly and didn't do any form of workout.

Another little known fact: sheep go to heaven, goats go to hell.
12lbs per gallon.
[removed]
Underrated comment.
Is that 8 buckets?
That seems really difficult just to hold.
Blackberries.
Exactly my thought.
I've carried two or three gallons in one hand and it isn't the weight, it's the pain.

Best thing I will hear/read all day.
Go ahead and Pat him on the back for telling me I'm a douchebag but no offense.
It's like telling someone that you hate them but wish them well.
It is known.
Got em.
Yup...Ones a browser the other is a grazer.
I mean, you do come off like a douchebag.
Why feel the need to mention your car?
Calm down son, might cut yourself on that edge.
God forbid a woman feels good about being fit.

Hell yes girl!
I lift too and I love see people's faces when I walk around with my big bag of dog food over my shoulder.
Yep, I used to carry 2-3 cans each hand up a flight of 25 stairs from the back of the warehouse.
It's so painful, but not terrible if you're determined.
I need to work with paint again.
It's a truck and it frames my pretext.
Besides everyone should be proud of their ford trucks, unless you're driving a glorified suv 4 foot bed unibody "compact" lololol.
Dude, its about 35 lbs per can.
8 cans.
4 in each hand is 140 PER HAND, with 280 total.
Hook the handles through a large carabiner or something similar so you have one strong, solid handle.
Good to go:)
More like buff in disguise.
Found the Canadian.
Just go in with baby goat videos.
Kill ‚Äòem with the cuteness.

Now that's a lie if I've ever heard one.
This is why nobody respects this Echo chamber of a subreddit.
I'll take truth over comforting platitudes and gross exaggerations any day... go watch an action movie where the girl beats up all the guys and jerk off.
280 lb deadlift in a controlled environment would be a phenomenal lift unless she weighed close to 300 lbs.
Leg strength is similar between men and women based on body weight but the weak link would be the grip.
Upper body strength tends to be about 50% that of a man.

And whip out a photo of them if anyone asks!
Finally.
Confirmed douche.
Wait, all men do martial arts, or even a majority of them?
Really.
That's news to me.
As someone who has owned goats, they eat everything, bite everything, and hate everything.
Just be aware that baby goats quickly become adult goats.
Those fuckers are mean.
I think it's because men dont do those sports that women would have an advantage if they knew those skills.b.
Maple leaves for everyone.
She didn't mention the weight of the paint cans.
They could be lighter than what the one poster's math is assuming.
I know it's probably just a joke but, don't get an animal for the purpose of being able to say that.
Deploy the tactical goats!
Make sure the reserve goats are ready!
It‚Äôs bait.
Oh, I totally know.
Stubborn, grumpy bastards, the lot of them.
They sucker you in with the baby phase.
For what it's worth, cats are probably easier to tend than goats, and you can say 'at home with the kits' which is close enough anyway....
Check out @GoatsofAnarchy on Instagram.
Prepare to spend the rest of your day saying, "awww."
You go girl!
I train my one female friend and she will shock people when she needs to go get salt bags (50lbs each) and just carry a couple with no cart right to her car like she's just holding a purse.
