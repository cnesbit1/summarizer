Can we feed this person some karma for taking the time and making the effort to screenshot and post this from the game.
meh, just a fluff ;P.
Let me add to it a bit, not to come off as rude or anything, tho I probably will to some.
But I find it a bit strange that meme "image macros" are considered low effort and low value posts, so most of them are removed, yet the sub is full of random image screenshots that is also low effort and value post, yet they all stay up basically, because it's from the game.
I'm not saying that memes should be all over the sub, because sometimes a few is on, but then again, why is a random screenshot from the game with a random title anything more effort than editing together a meme image and posting it?
At least some meme needs editing and some effort, unlike pressing print-screen on the keyboard.
Just because it is out of the game, it still doesn't have any value and even less effort to do than a so called meme or such people post occasionally.
Before anyone misunderstand, I'm not trying to defend meme images posted here, I simply don't get it how are random screenshots far superior in effort and value, than memes.
Totally agree.
FREE THE MEMES!
What's more effort, finding this book ingame or copypasting some meme from google on mspaint?
I'm fairly sure the issue isn't memes itself, but how people abuse them.
One person make it, that's fine, but then the sub have shortly 10 more threads of the same meme reformatted to karma whore.
I think mods also remove memes with effort put in them, not necessarily copypaste memes.
This book is literally next to an npc you need to talk to for a story step.
It's near  impossible to miss.
I honestly agree mainly just because I believe memes are anything but low effort.
It takes a lot of editing to create something that will make people smile.

Well, at least I don't have to try and say all that this time (and get collectively lynched).
The last official statement I know of went as "people have reported *this thing* a lot, so we took it down".
So, I guess, if all the people who consider random two-click wiki-grade/guild-grade screenshots to be **low-effort** actually **report** them as such, something might eventually change.
Because if the subreddit mods don't have black and white rules people will bitch about things not being followed to the letter of the rule.
It's easier to have a blanket meme ban and allow all game screenshots than it is to go through submissions individually and deal with everyone who says their post should be allowed or that a post should be removed.
