Original Response: 
I believe the manga version of the Bible to be the only accurate translation.
The New Revised Manga Version is also quite good...
*Revised Manga Version Catholic Edition, thank you very much.
Including those otherwise hard to find chapters.
As a Southern Baptist I would just like to add that The manga version of the Bible is inerrant.
Does that one have Joseph Smith written into it too??

The scanlation groups have better quality.
Some people say those are just doujin tho...
The *Dragonball GT* of the Bible.

I have a few of these.
They were coming out while I was in Japan and I love them.
The idea is that Japanese people are more likely to read a manga about Jesus than a word-only Bible.
I gave one to my Japanese host mom and she definitely read it.
Good stuff

Ed: clarification.
How accurate was it?
Good translation?
I, too, am interested in the answer to this.
Upvoting for curiousity.
The Bible in OP's picture is the New Living Translation.
It's actually just a standard Bible with an additional super-condensed ~40 manga pages illustrating stories from the Old Testament, and ~40 manga pages illustrating the Gospel.
You can buy it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Bible-NLT-Tyndale/dp/1414316798).
Source: I bought this exact Bible about 11 or 12 years ago.

Well...it kind of depends on your goal.
Would I recommend it for a study bible?
Definitely not, lol.
What you lose in a comic-presentation is precision.
There’s interpretation necessarily going into what people look like as they say or do things.
If 90% of communication is body language and HOW you say something, you’re of course getting some artistic interpretation in a manga presentation of the Word.
However, if you’re talking about introducing the Gospel to people who don’t even know the cross is a Christian symbol, then it’s wonderful.
It’s a “their world” way of making the scriptures accessible.
Like using a pine tree to explain the love of God to the Celts.
It’s very much a wonderful way of doing “there is a God, and this is Who He is.” 

I mean...my Japanese host mom was 65 and active in Buddhism, but because of this book she read the Bible.
She heard the Gospel.
She would never have opened a regular Bible, but she read the manga.
Oh super cool!
Thanks!
Correct answer!

It was...when I saw it lying open in the living room, it just filled me heart.
