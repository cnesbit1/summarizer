I have a Marshadow OT: MT.
Tensei, ID No.
100917, and Kalos Cap Pikachu OT: Ash, ID No.
011814, both are self redeemed.
I have not picked up from the npc yet, so I can give you any nature you want on both.
Iâ€™ll take screenshots when I pick them up, as well as the Mystery Gift Card Album.
And Iâ€™m looking for a Jolly Groudon, with any IVs.
And maybe a Modest Kyogre unless thatâ€™s too much, then just the Groudon is fine.
Just any Kyogre/groudon?
Or the 2018 ones?
As long as itâ€™s from USUM, I donâ€™t care.
I personally canâ€™t do that stupid mini-game and I missed last months event.
Okay I see you have both s/m idk if you also have us/um I can give you 4 codes they are still redeemable and you'd just have to reset for nature's would that be ok?
You'd be able to get 2 of each if you have all 4 games.
Or I can find someone to reedem them for us.
I have SM, but only UM.
Well 3 then and you'd be able to get lvl 60 of each and also lvl 100 groudon, the one you want more anyways ðŸ˜‹.
That sounds good, now did you have any preference for the nature for either PokÃ©mon?
Pikachu I don't care haha.
Marshadow if possible Jolly or Naive thanks!
Ok just give me a little bit to soft reset for Marshadow, message you when I finish.
Thanks :)
Ok, I just finished.
Hereâ€™s my proof that I just claimed them: https://imgur.com/a/e6VBLhs.
Thank you!
Logging on now.
Sent the codes and received Pokemon thank you so much!
Thank you as well.

Summary: 
I have a Marshadow OT: MT.
I have SM, but only UM.

Pikachu I don't care haha.
