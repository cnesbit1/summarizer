Original Response: 
So I hit the last milestone before finishing my doctorate program this week and my girlfriend is taking me out for dinner and drinks ( I don't drink though) to celebrate.
We have been together for over 2 years and our relationship is really good right now.
It's definitely the strongest it's been for a long time.
We started living with each other earlier this year which neither of us have ever done before and it's been really fantastic seeing each other every day and working together to maintain an apartment.
However, two things have occurred.
One is that we see each other daily, get changed in front of each other etc.
so gone is the anticipation of waiting to see each other that we had when we were living apart.
This isn't isn't a huge problem in itself, but the other issue is that I have recently started taking a medication that severely decreases my libido.
I would estimate it's been decreased by 90%.
In many ways this is a good thing because it puts us into a good balance with each other (she is  on the lower end regarding libido (except when she drinks) and I definitely was hypersexual).
We tried to have sex last night, and it was just an utter failure.
So tonight I was thinking that we could do something a bit extra in order to get me more in the mood.
I'm an average looking guy by anyone's standards.
However, my gf is not average.
She is well above average and I'm not saying that from a biased perspective.
My friends, brothers, sister, parents essentially say "how did this happen?"
LOL and I love it.
Everywhere we go people stare at her chest and her body, ask if they are real etc.
So tonight I want her and I to go to a bar after dinner and pretend we don't know each other.
I want to watch her get drunk by having guys buy her drinks and watch her dance with another guy, maybe get close to crossing the line, and I'll come into the scene and take her home and "punish" her.
I think that watching other males try to get with her will kick into my competitive drive and I'll be able to perform well tonight.
I definitely have worked hard and this would be a great reward for me.
I only have a few hours left and I need help thinking of a strategy to introduce this idea to her without making her feel like I don't value her or any other possible ways she could feel negatively about this idea.
It's not going to be out of left field, she knows that I like when people look at her, and if we go out, and she asks for an opinion I always pick the more revealing outfit.
Also, we have sexted about a similar idea one time earlier this year, but there is a difference between sexting and making it a reality.
Has anyone been in this situation before and have any advice on how to introduce this idea in a tasteful way that guarantees the greatest chance of success?
She is a bit conservative sort of shy when it comes to anything sexual doesn't have a lot of experience etc.
Tl;dr  I started medication and need to spice things up in the bedroom.
Need help introducing the idea to my gf that I would like to watch her flirt and dance with other guys that think she's single and available tonight at the bar.

EDIT: I think it goes without saying that she's not going to be forced into anything, but apparently I have to say it.
LOL.

What field is your PhD in?

God, I think this is about the most shallowest thing I've read.
&amp;#x200B;
Says the guy implying that this woman is with him because of his “PhD”...
Might actually be the case here.
:P.
&gt;God, I think this is about the most shallowest thing I've read.
&amp;#x200B;

I think you has the worstest grammer 

Lol if you are going to attack me at least be prepared to get it back.
&amp;#x200B;

What does it matter what my degree is in?
Why is pointing out an aspect of my relationship that I enjoy considered shallow?
What do you define shallow as?
At no point did I indicate that this asepct of my relationship was my sole or even in the top 5 reasons that I am with this woman.
&amp;#x200B;

Some women have large breasts and also don’t choose partners based off of money or education.
It’s pretty misogynistic to say these things.
If we really want to be pedantic.
It's grammar.
But that isn't really the point.
Oh it does matter, it tells people that education doesn't mean shit.
No one is attacking you, it's simply the truth.
She's with me because of my personality, definitely.
She has confirmed that on many occasions.
She's with me because of my personality, definitely.

LOL I'm aware.
I was mocking you and therefore the misspelling of grammar was part of the mockery.
&amp;#x200B;

Education isn't end all be all when it comes to intelligence.
It's not that educated people are more intelligent, it's just that intelligent people tend to have more education.
Usually the people that attack those with lots of education about having lots of education are just trying to make themselves feel better about the fact that they feel inferior because they have less education.
However, the inferiority is not that they in having less education, it's feeling the need to attack someone for something they worked hard to achieve.
That being said, I don't know why you are trying to draw an inverse relationship between my Ph.D and fantasy that I'm using reddit to ask for help with.
You again, completely miss the point.
First you mock the grammar, which is irrelevant.
Then you go on about education about that's not what I'm mocking.
I'm mocking your integrity and values.
So again, where did you get your PhD?
From a University in the United States, It's in neuroscience if that is somehow relevant.
You are mocking my integrity and values?
Why because my values are different than yours?
You feel that yours are somehow superior to mine?
I won't keep assuming, I'll just let you answer.
That being said there is nothing to mock regarding my integrity.
I am certainly a person of great integrity although you might not be able to see that because  presumably your values are different.
No response?
There's a world to mock.
There's a reason why cheating is wrong.
You get excited by watching that in action.
But you know this.
You are just in denial.
That's fine.
Sigh.
Please stop asking me to respond.
If that's what you want to do then go ahead, but it is as disgusting and disgraceful as it is.
This isn't cheating you moron.
Again, idiotic behavior from a PhD holder.
Oh the humanity.
If you are that into watching your girlfriend get fucked by someone else, just go do it.
Idiot.
I don’t see what my degree has to do with this... seems like you ha e some weird quirk regarding highly educated people, 

I don’t want her to sleep with anyone else, if that was the case I would have specified.
I’m calling you a moron because this isn’t cheating.
Cheating requires one partner to break an agreement, that is not occurring in my situation.

Summary: 
LOL and I love it.
So again, where did you get your PhD?
She's with me because of my personality, definitely.
I'm mocking your integrity and values.
Then you go on about education about that's not what I'm mocking.

God, I think this is about the most shallowest thing I've read.
