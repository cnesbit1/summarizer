Original Response: 
Ovechkin will break the career goals record.
My instinct was to spit out my coffee, but then I checked.
He has 607 in 1003 games played.
Basically 0.6 GPG.
He needs about 300 more goals.
So if he can score 50 goals a season into age 37/38 he can do it.
But if he does it, it'll be more like he plays until he's 43 just so he can break the record with a final 9-goal season or something.
I really do hope so.
I would love for him to be the undisputed best goal scorer.
It's too bad what would've been his first year was lost to the lockout or else he'd have probably 50+ more goals to his name and the record would definitely be more easily attainable.
I would love to see OV break the record.
I really hope he does.
Most goals will not make him the undisputed best goal scorer though.
It absolutely would

He's certainly in the conversation for greatest goal scorer as it stands, scoring the most goals ever would make him undeniably the GOAT.
You have to consider his time on ice, games played, zone starts, line matchups.
We don't really have info for any of that (besides games played) for the guys he's competing with.
Richard, Howe, and Hull all came before any kind of advanced stats and even something like time on ice was only introduced in Gretzky's last season

No one from 2005 on his era compares to him as a goal scorer.
The only word I have a problem with is undisputed.
If we don't have those stats then may be tough to say it's absolutely in no way possibly disputable.
You have to consider the guy who holds the rcofd played when goalies were trash and defense was clueless.
Considering he already has the title, you're technically correct.
I can’t find it right now, but I had a table showing that if he scored at Brett hulls pace for the next 6 years (at the same age 33-38) and then jags for the next 4 after that (39-42).
He breaks it.
And he never even has to score 40 again.
IMO, it will come down to how long he wants to play.
Fuck yeah.
Love me some semantics.
When you're comparing a career you literally can't compare those things, too much variation to have any legitimate results.
Ovi has played in the one of the toughest times to score goals, if he breaks the career record he's definitely the undisputed best goal scorer ever.
Right?
What a waste of time lol.
Not to mention the lockout shortened season(could be another 20 there) and the times he was made to play more d, that could be another 20-30 there for all we know.
I still think he can get it if he plays into his 40s.
He might already be.
Ignoring era adjustments is stupid.

He's already pretty close to being the undisputed best goal scorer ever.
gretzky had a lockout shortened season as well, though mind you it wasnt at the peak of his career.
How is he better than Wayne?
In the 10-year window where Gretzky was regularly scoring 50 goals a year (79/80 to 88/89), 39 players scored 50+ goals a total of 76 times (38 and 65 if you don't include Gretzky).
Gretzky had nine 50-goal seasons in this stretch, with Mike Bossy coming in closest at seven and four others trailing with four each.
Ovechkin's window as a dominant goal scorer is already bigger (one goal away from having his fourth 50-goal season in 5 years in Season 13), but even if we use the full 13-year window instead of just 10, there are only eleven 50 goal scorers in that time, who combine for twenty 50 goal seasons.
Without Ovechkin, it's 10 and 14.
Ovechkin is one of only four players to score 50 multiple times from 05/06 to today, and the only one to do it more than twice (he's done it 7 times).
tl;dr - There are fewer goals available and fewer high-end goal scorers around today than there were in the 80's.
While Gretzky's got the bigger numbers, Ovechkin's are arguably more impressive when compared to his era.
By this theory, I can grab literally anyone from before 1997/98 (or 2007/08 if we're including zone starts and matchups), call them the best goal scorer of all time, and claim that you have a lack of evidence if you try to dispute it.
Totally.
Ya in the lockout year Gretzky had exactly a PPG, and the rest of his career averaged only slightly over a PPG (and not a lot of goals, mostly assists) so I would say that OV's rookie year would be much more impactful on his stats than on Gretzky's.
Ya the Dale Hunter year lol.
I also believe he can too, even if he only becomes useful on the powerplay when his speed drops off he could still score 30+ just shooting it from his spot.
As you said, just depends on how long he plays, if he plays until he's 42 he has a real shot at getting it.

*How long he wants to play in the NHL.
You mean he can't set a goals record for the NHL by playing in a different league?
10 year window seems pretty arbitrary, comparing their first 13 years in the league, we get:

**Ovechkin**:

*1003 GP - 607 G* (1st, 196 goal lead)

*0.61 G/GP* (1st, 0.09 G/GP lead)

*374 EVG* (1st, 90 goal lead)

*229 PPG* (1st, 96 goal lead)

*4 SHG* (Tied 188th, 26 behind the lead)

*29 ENG* (2nd, 1 behind the lead)

—-

**Gretzky**:

*999 GP - 749 G* (1st, 211 goal lead)

*0.75 G/GP* (4th, 0.05 G/GP behind the lead)

*517 EVG* (1st, 155 goal lead)

*166 PPG* (Tied 1st, 7 goal lead)

*66 SHG* (1st, 26 goal lead)

*45 ENG* (1st, 22 goal lead)

—-

So here are just some basic goal scoring stats over each players first thirteen years in the league.
It’s worth noting that while Wayne is fourth in G/GP during that time, he had at least 400 more games played than any of the players above him.
They are obviously both the most dominant goalscorers during this time, but Wayne hasn’t relied as much on the powerplay for his overall goal totals.
Gretzky scored 69.0% at even strength, 22.2% on the PP, 8.8% while shorthanded, and 6.0% in empty nets.
Ovi had 61.6% at even strength, 37.7% on the PP, 0.7% while shorthanded, and 4.8% in empty nets.
So Ovi has obviously been the best goalscorer of his era, but Wayne was much more well-rounded in his scoring and didn’t lean on the man-advantage so much.
And yes, even though there are fewer high-end scorers in this era, Gretzky was still far, far beyond the rest of the pack in years he lead and when considering the whole thirteen year stretch as a whole.
You don’t say.
Imagine if Ovi never went to the KHL /s.
I know he’s already 32 but nothing this season showed me that he can’t win another 2-3 Richards and stay in the top 10 in goalscoring until his late 30s.
He already is when you do era adjustment.
10th place this year was 39 goals.
If he can score at least that many every year, he can pass Gretzky halfway through 8 seasons from now.
If he scores 50 two more times, then 40 twice, then 30 twice, then 20 three times, he'd hit 907 goals by age 41.
(Which, of course, isn't the record.
But I just like round numbers.)

Your answer was basically nothing, the other guy that replied first actually gave evidence and figures to back up their opinion.
You might as well have just said “because I said so”.
[deleted]
Well I already got a pretty good, specific response from that question, so I think it was fine?
[deleted]
Im on reddit talking about hockey, not working for a pay here, bud.
Relax lol.
[deleted]
You're gonna need to start hoping the NHL wants to go to the Olympics.
Another skip means he's probably leaving for the KHL when his contract expires in 3 years.
[removed]
While it would be cool I just don't see it happening.
His skill set allowing his goals won’t decline either, it’s strength for that shot form the dot.
He’s going to be hitting that in a beer league at 50 bear as well.
Very possible.
He does it all the time in EA NHL.
He seems to have adapted to his diminishing speed and can still score at a high level.
If he remains durable,  doesn't have to endure another lockout, and can stick around the league (Leonsis will let him stay for as long as he wants I'm sure) I think there's a chance he could challenge for it.
Scoring more on the power play should not count against someone.
I always forget that first lockout lol.
Probably because I was only 1 haha.
But that is a fair point.
If that's a full season, he gets over 900 and it's a lot harder for ovi.
I may be biased in the sense I want to see the record broken, but it'll be an exciting push.
He "lashed out" because he's right, your response was completely devoid of anything.
It was as if you said "because I'm right so deal with it".
Other people have responded to his comments with great and supported  responses so clearly the issue wasnt what he asked.
His comment generated hockey discussion.
Yours aimed at shutting down hockey discussion.
One is good for the sub, one is bad for the sub.
[deleted]
You didn't address anything in any of your comment ts in this chain.

Point out where you added anything of substance to the conversation.
All you did was say over and over again "uh your question didn't mean anything" despite the fact that other people responded to his question without issue.
In that 10 year window Gretzky had more 60+ goal years than he did 50, had four consecutive 70+ goal seasons (of a total 14 in league history), set the single season goal record of **92** and additionally took spot number two, with **87.
** He also set the record for fewest games to 50 goals, in 39 games.
But sure let's just call that "regularly scoring 50 goals a year."
[deleted]
Im saying its *bad*, just that I value even-strength goals over with a man advantage when under 10% of the game is played on a powerplay.
The idea was to show how others were scoring in that time frame.
If we want to talk about their individual goals, we have things like hockey-reference's adjusted goals statistic (that normalizes totals based on league-wide scoring); Gretzky's best ten-year run is 501 adjusted goals (which is still absurd), while Ovechkin's best is 579.
That includes two years that normalize to 60+ goals for Gretzky (68 in his 92-goal year, 69 in his 87), compared to three for Ovechkin (72 in his 65 goal year, 62 in the lockout half-season, 60 in 2015).
Ovy also has seven 55 adj.
goal seasons to Gretzky's three.
Again, none of this makes 99 chopped liver and overall he's the much better player all-time, but Ovy's the goal king in my eyes.

Summary: 
goal seasons to Gretzky's three.
He needs about 300 more goals.
Ovechkin will break the career goals record.
I really do hope so.
I really hope he does.
I would love for him to be the undisputed best goal scorer.
