You aren't unreasonable for getting upset.
He should have supported you and not get mad because he knows that you have anxiety issues.
But I have to ask why did you choose have two kids in a foreign country with little to no sypport system(and a lack of language skills)?
On one hand he should support you, on the other hand he can't be your only means of support.
He could have blown up because he has to deal with your anxiety, family expectations, and his first kid with another on the way.
Also he doesn't seem in love with you at all.
A loving husband talks to his wife and enjoys her company.
Was your first child planned?
It reads like he's just with you because you are the mother of his child.
Does his culture push a "if you get her pregnant, take responsibility no matter how it makes you feel" ideal?

Is it possible for you to go home?
You said you've been there for a long time.
So why haven't you picked up the language?
I get having kids could make that hard but do you want your kids to act as translators for you?
Because that's what'll happen.
Maybe instead of following him to family events where you don't actually socialize with anyone, use that time to work on learning the language, or just give him the space to go chill with his family and you do something else.
&gt; You said you've been there for a long time.
So why haven't you picked up the language?
I don't understand that either.
Maybe her husband is tired of always having to be her translator.
She needs to be more aggressive  about learning the language.
&gt; Our first was planned but we hardly knew each other.
The relationship issues go right back to the beginning.
&gt; You said you've been there for a long time.
So why haven't you picked up the language?
I think it's the social anxiety.
Learning a language is embarrassing, because you know when you speak the second language you are making mistakes.
It's going to be far worse if you have anxiety about it.

Why on earth did you plan a baby with a man you hardly knew?
I mean, look, I don't mean to pile it on here; done is done.
But this is not a new problem.
You committed to and got pregnant with a man before you knew him, from another culture that I presume you didn't understand either (since you met in the third country), and now you're getting to know him and finding he is in no way equipped to be your husband.
(I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that perhaps his culture accepts neglect of wives as normal, since no one else in his family seems too interested in making this better either).
This is not a problem about a party, it's that you have constructed a life that makes no sense, with a man who makes no sense, and possibly in a cultural context that makes no sense either.
I realise it's difficult to rethink this with a baby and another on the way, but nonetheless I think it's what you should do.
This seems to be who he is, who his family is, what this life is.
If you don't want what it's become, I really think you should consider leaving.
I am not someone who normally suggests leaving over transitory slights, even serious ones.
But I think the offense in this case is the tip of the iceberg, and underneath are some fundamental problems you will be living with permanently.
Unethical but a great idea!

Well then you should have pushed yourself to learn the language.
When you said he talks all the time to others, I wondered whether it was in the local language or English.
You know you aren't going anywhere any time soon.
Make learning the language your number one priority right now.
Get yourself into an intensive language program somewhere.
