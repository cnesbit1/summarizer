&gt;So I asked my husband to put the new stickers on the license plates.
He texted me back maybe an hour later say "all taken care of."
&gt;I asked him why he didn't put the stickers on, he said he just forgot.
I asked him why he told me he put the stickers on the plate, he said he "pre-texted" and meant to get to it.
So he lied to you, his lie caused a stressful and expensive thing to happen to you, and his response is basically "shit happens?"
What?
I have to ask, is this a part of a larger pattern where he disregards your feelings?
I'd feel terrible if I caused my partner to get $1300 in tickets, to say nothing of the lie.
I can't imagine this is an isolated incident.
Did he even apologize?
What is your honest opinion of why he lied about putting the sticker on the car?
I think it's just a little unfair to put the $1300 on the husband.
Obviously he's in the wrong but the other 4 tickets were not on him.
Not sure how much the non registration ticket is but the anger should be based on how much that part would be costing her.
I'm not saying he's entirely responsible, but he's responsible enough to at least friggin apologize and show some empathy.
If she doesn't get pulled over for the expired tags she doesn't get the other tickets.
Even if she was 100% at fault you'd expect more sympathy from a spouse...
I definitely agree him needing to apologize but I don't thing he has any responsibility for the other 4 tickets.
Just because he caused the initial doesn't mean he cause the others.
That's adding too much blame onto him when he couldn't have controlled those points.
A bit like saying hitlers parents are to blame for the holocaust.
But again I do think he needs to apologize.
Just we should look at it like she didn't get the other 4 tickets.
If the first ticket was say $300 then we should judge based on that.
&gt;I'd feel terrible if I caused my partner to get $1300 in tickets

That's taking it too far.
A ticket for outdated registration would be at most 10% of that total while the husband is certainly at fault for that, the rest of the fine is entirely down to the cop being an asshat.
Also, you don't get tickets for no tags when you also have proof of registration within the car, which is required by law.
In that sense, OP also shares some blame for not having the proper documentation within her vehicle.
But regardless, that will be the easiest ticket to get thrown out if she decides to go to court and prove she had a valid registration at the time of the ticket.
Would she have gotten pulled over if not for his laziness?
It‚Äôs all his fault.
And his lack of empathy is disgusting.

She‚Äôs going to go to court, which is annoying and stressful, but pay $0 in fines.the stress is valid, the fines aren‚Äôt going to be a thing.
That‚Äôs the total sum of tickets including being written up for the cell phones.
The expired tags were the reason she got pulled over in the first place so yes, he is responsible for all of it.

That's not how blame works.
If she had been smuggling coke or something and went to jail would you say it was his fault for her going to jail?
No, she did something wrong and was caught because of his wrong.
That doesn't make her wrong his wrong.
But I agree the lack of empathy is a red flag.
I just always wonder how much bias we are getting when we hear a story.
In any case if you blame someone for more than they are responsible for they will get defensive about the things that are their fault.
[removed]
You've now compared having a phone on a console to smuggling coke and his actions as parenting Hitler.
I think you need to reassess and dial back the insane examples.
There are multiple causes for any one event like this.
The way to figure out if his contribution was significant is to ask "would this have happened if he had put the stickers on, was he doing something wrong, and could he have reasonably predicted the immediate outcome?"
He knew he was making her car illegal on the street.
He knew the consequences for that are potentially being pulled over.
Even if he couldn't have predicted the cop was a jerk, he should have at least the tiniest shred of guilt for putting that on her head.
[removed]
But she wouldn't have been pulled over in the first place if the stickers were on her car.

It's totally fair.
But for his negligence and lie, OP probably wouldn't have been pulled over in the first place.
The whole ordeal is a result of the husband being a nincompoop.

I mean shit does happen when your SO is irresponsible and doesn't care.
Shit just happens more often.

I wouldn't be so sure.
An actual pull over stop for expired registration stickers is pretty rare compared to a stop for using the phone.
Especially with all of the camera systems that would tell the officer that the reg was current.
Proof of registration comes with the new tags.
I'm sure she thought he put the paper in the car because it's part of the task "taking care of the registration."
[removed]
preaaaach, exactly what i think.
did you stretch before that huge reach?
phones / drugs, they dont even begin to equate.
its not a crime to have your phone in the front of the car with you - she wasnt using them.
the officer stopped her because of her husbands lax behaviour.
its his fault &amp; he should pay, because shit happens you know?

&gt;As the driver, the legal responsibility for having all legal matters related to driving in order fall on OP.
That, too, is fact.
Because she was breaking the law re: her car registration, the cop was more inclined to think she was breaking another law.
She wasn't, in fact, breaking the law by having the phones on the center console.
The officer assumed she was.
That's why your drug analogy doesn't quite work.
She wasn't speaking on her phone and they wouldn't have been visible on the center console to a police officer driving by, so her husband's lie exposed her unfairly to the scrutiny of the police as far as the cell phones are concerned.
So, to answer your earlier question, this is his fault even though it's her legal responsibility.
The post concerns the interpersonal aspect, not the legal aspect.
As you have already said, he was a jerk, and he caused this situation (including the distracted driver tickets).

That's like saying "I didn't salt the driveway like I said I did, but I couldn't have known you'd twist your ankle and have to go to the doctor!
I could only know you'd slip!"
By opening her to the risk, even though the effect isn't *necessarily* required to happen, he becomes at fault for all of it.
[removed]
Are you OPs husband?
Because you seem oddly invested in exonerating him.
He caused a situation in which a cranky cop gave her additional tickets for something she didn't do - use her phone while driving.
If her husband had done what she asked him the cop would never have stopped her and since *she was not using her phone* while driving wouldn't have been given those extra tickets.
Thank you for this fantastic analogy!
I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs so hard for some people to understand that her getting the phone fines was directly related to her husband‚Äôs failure to do the simple task of putting the rego sticker on.
There would be no phone fine if she hadn‚Äôt been pulled over for having an unregistered car.

It‚Äôs her fault.
It‚Äôs not ‚Äúhubbys‚Äù responsibility.
She a big girl.
The officer explicitly pulled her over for the registration and refused to check if it was current.
He tacked the distracted driving stuff on, but it was pretty clear in the story that he added that when he saw them, which couldn‚Äôt have been before he pulled her over because she wasn‚Äôt actually using them.

Why are you equating drugs to cell phones?
Smuggling drugs is illegal and cell phones existing are not.
This is a false equivalency.
OP wasn‚Äôt doing anything illegal that was her own fault.
Even if she had illegal drugs it would ultimately have been her husbands fault she got caught... because he didn‚Äôt change the stickers like he said he would.
Yea I don‚Äôt understand why multiple people are comparing the cell phones to smuggling drugs.
Uh one of these are illegal and one is not?
üòÇ.
Dude, are you serious right now?
He could have had a bad day at home and let it out on her, he might have had an altercation with another, aggressive driver earlier that he was still riled up about, or he might be the kind of person who likes to go on power trips.
Kinda the way I also see it.
She has a little room to be upset for him forgetting, but come on.
Depending on someone for something so small is stupid and lazy, put the sticker on the plate your damn self.
Especially if its the vehicle that you mainly drive (unsure if this is the case but likely).
Forgetting small shit like this is so common it actually makes me laugh that she notes that this occurrence will decrease her attraction to her husband for some time.
Poor guy.
Did you miss the part where she says she was gone for a month on business when the mail came.....is she supposed to fly back home to put the sticker on, then fly back to where she was?
OR her husband could just do the right thing and take care of this one little task for her while she's on her trip.
If you read it carefully she argued with him about the tags and the phone tickets.
That‚Äôs what I was getting at.
Next time you talk to police, don‚Äôt.
I don‚Äôt see any reason to do any of that inconvenient stuff.
‚ÄúHey honey, your sticker came in the mail, Ill leave it on the counter (or wherever) for you to put on your car when you get back‚Äù.
Simple and no petty finger pointing.
Also, she gets to be responsible for her own shit, so win-win.
So why'd he take responsibility upon himself to do it instead of replying back to her with what you just said?
It's not finger-pointing if you say you're gonna do it.
Example: we're roommates and I'm gonna be gone for a week.
I say "hey buddy can you feed my cat" and you reply back "sure, no prob, just fed her for the day" and proceed to not do it.
I have a right to be mad at you and blame you for my cat being hungry!
If you replied back "no I can't" then I would have known you weren't gonna do it and arranged accordingly.
The husband agreed with her, its not like he was strong-armed into it.
It's his responsibility as well.
&gt; Glad to see civil discourse is alive and well.
They pointed out that your post is drastically different from what actually happened.
It's like if someone got pulled over for not having a helmet somewhere where it was legal and you questioned "what if they murdrered someone in front of the cop HUH?"
it was way overdramatic and unrelated.
Its not made clear whether or not she put the responsibility on him, or if he took it on himself when the sticker came in the mail.
My guess would be that he mentioned it arriving and she asked him to put it on.
It would seem petty for him to tell her to put it on herself, so he agrees and then forgets because its an inconvenient task that has been given to him - in response to him already letting her know that it arrived.
This is compounded if he doesn‚Äôt drive the vehicle in question.
In my above statement, I agree that she has room to be upset at him for forgetting what he agreed to do.
However this is limited due to this being such a minuscule task that she should ultimately be taking care of herself if this is the car that only she drives (which sounds like the case here).
The example you provide is planning ahead.
OP‚Äôs example is a spur of the moment ‚Äúhey can you do this thing for me thanks‚Äù, which is a little different.
In your example I wouldn‚Äôt look bad saying ‚Äúnah sorry man‚Äù, compared to him saying ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm busy and don‚Äôt have time for your sticker‚Äù to his wife.
Even if he had said this, she would still be pissed at him (albeit for something different than what this post is about).
Yeah, he shouldn‚Äôt have agreed to do it considering he forgot to do it.
Thats a mistake on his part that he will hopefully learn from.
Yeah, she shouldn‚Äôt have asked him to do it - thats laziness and a mistake on her part that she will hopefully learn from.
Sounds like having phones within arms reach is illegal in their place of residence so yes, they were doing something illegal.

She lives in the US by her use of USPS and unless you have the phone in your hand it‚Äôs not illegal.
Some states even allow you to be actively talking on the phone while driving.
The cop was being a jerk and assumed she was on the phone and gave her tickets.
It‚Äôs not illegal to have your phone near you in any state in the US.

So it's his fault she had cell phone in reach?
No either she did it illegally or the cop gave her a bad ticket.
That part isn't on him.
Except slipping on ice is a clear risk of not doing the deicing.
Getting busted for doing something illegal is not a clear risk of getting pulled over.
[removed]
Lmao what are you on about?
She didn‚Äôt do anything illegal and the cop was being a jerk but it still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if her husband hadn‚Äôt lied to her about putting the new sticker on the car she wouldn‚Äôt have gotten any of the tickets.

I think it's just a little unfair to put the $1300 on the husband.

That's not how blame works.
Obviously he's in the wrong but the other 4 tickets were not on him.
