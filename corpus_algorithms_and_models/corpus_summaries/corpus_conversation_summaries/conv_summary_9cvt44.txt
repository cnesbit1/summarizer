Original Response: 
when she get them curves lol she gets more and more attractive.
She's been working out a lot for her role in the next Star Wars movie.
Results are showing and they're great, as you can see.
Unpopular opinion: i usually find her incredible but i think she looks kinda strange here.
Just my opinion, still don't deserve a girl as awesome as her but out of what I've seen of her i feel this is her worst.
It's the hairstyle, I'd say.
Not really digging it tbh, but I think her body looks better than ever.
Idk buddy i felt she looked to stocky and that dress didnt do anything for her, and too much makeup was covering her natural beauty.

Summary: 
It's the hairstyle, I'd say.
