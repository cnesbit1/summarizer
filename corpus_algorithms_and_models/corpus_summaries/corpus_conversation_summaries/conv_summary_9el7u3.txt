Original Response: 
I don't encourage it at all, but this part:

&gt;“If you are a man and you see your friends making someone feel uncomfortable, if you see them making a remark to a woman or you see your mates on social media attack a woman or say something nasty about her: call them out.”

Really?
So only men are capable of assault?
No, but it’s statistically we are the most likely ones responsible.
Call out strangers, call out your mates.
DO something, make the world a better place by refusing to condone or turn a blind eye to unacceptable behaviour.
Well thank god you used this opportunity to grandstand for the men.
I’m not saying NOT to turn a blind eye, ANY form of assault should be reported; male or female.
What grandstand?
ANY form of assault or harassment should be reported; male or female.
I just don’t see why you’re trying to derail it with a “but what about men?
!” Comment as the main issue at hand is that there’s a male-perpetrated assault problem worldwide.
Quite Nolchian.
Which is why you did the "what about meeeennn" of course.
If that’s how you want to interpret it, then fine.
