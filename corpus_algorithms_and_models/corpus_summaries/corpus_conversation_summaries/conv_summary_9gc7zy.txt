Did he try again?
Nope.
I think I hurt his over-inflated ego.
That's incredibly rich coming from you.
I’m rich in diarrhea and self-loathing.
All jokes aside, you genuinely don’t know me.
I’m an anxiety-riddled flesh bag diagnosed with depression, so ego is not something I have right now.
I’m trying to build confidence after four years of hating myself and thinking I don’t deserve to be happy with who I am, but it’s a tough process.
You’ve seen literally one moment from me: a moment of frustration and disgust.
It’s tough to judge an entire person from one moment.
Says the person who went out of their way to start an argument with someone just because you didn't like a quote they used and the way they talked/typed.
I think you might need to take some of your advice.
Being depressed and hating yourself doesn't give you a free pass to be antagonistic to people for no real reason.
What did you achieve from this interaction?
You wouldn't have felt 'frustration and disgust' if you didn't engage with him.
Maybe you wouldn't hate yourself if you tried to be a bit nicer to people.
I AM nice to people.
I have moments like this, though, where I’m not.
Moments.
You genuinely don’t know me.
You're nice to people you want to be nice to, there's a big difference.
No, I don't know you, but you've given a lot away with this post and your comments in this thread.
Why did this random guy deserve to be on the receiving end of one of your 'moments'?
Just because you thought the way he talked wasn't to your liking.
*You* were the one being cringey, as many people in this thread have pointed out to you.
You were just baiting some poor guy in hopes that you could reap some precious internet points.
I'm really glad it backfired on you, maybe you'll think twice before taking your 'moments' out on a stanger.
Strangers take their moments out on me all the time.
I’m sorry, but I’m not going to allow people to shit on me for something we all do.
'Sometimes people take their bad moods out on me, so I'm going to perpetuate the cycle by doing the same thing to somebody else.
That'll help me feel better' 

Fucking A reasoning you've got there.
You really do seem like an unpleasant person.
What do you want from me, perfection?
Hindsight is 20/20 and I’m not always going to be right.
My reactions aren’t always going to be perfect or my best.
I will make mistakes and continue to.
I’m not going to beat myself up because I was rude to one guy on Tinder who is an asshat anyway.
We all are.
A little social awareness wouldn't go amiss.

You're a saint.
I don't think I'd have the patience to help this guy understand his actions or gain some clarity, let alone offer him another chance to start over.
The world needs more people like you who can place a mental mirror in front of people who need self-improvement, instead of berating them, where their resentment for society can just get worse.
I thought I was a big ol’ butthole, but thank you for sharing your optimism!
💜 I bet you’re equally lovely and kind.
You were definitely a big ol' butthole but sometimes that's what people need in life

Edit: To clarify, I just think honesty is better than lying.
&gt; You're a saint.
&gt;Goes around trying instigate an argument

Maybe a shitty Boondock Saint.
Hi, pot.
I’m kettle.
Fancy you calling me black, eh?
Fucking hell, would someone care to explain all the downvotes?
Would actually like to know.
Brigading from /r/incels maybe?
I would, too.
Apparently I’m just pure shit.
🤷🏻‍♀️.
That’s probably why a lot of folks are here saying I’m cringey and criticizing me so harshly.
These folks sit in their ivory tower but I’d love to see them in their worst moment(s).
No..
I think it’s because you genuinely are in the wrong.
I know it may sound nuts.
I mean look at your  post , you’re doing the same thing that you’re complaining about right now.
Except in this instance were actually responding to something and not randomly messaging you starting an argument about it.
Are you for real?
Just accept you are wrong.
A bunch of salty subs got banned and they are floating throughout reddit now spreading their mgtow and incel.

Summary: 
I have moments like this, though, where I’m not.
I AM nice to people.
I think it’s because you genuinely are in the wrong.
You genuinely don’t know me.
Would actually like to know.
I think you might need to take some of your advice.
I will make mistakes and continue to.
