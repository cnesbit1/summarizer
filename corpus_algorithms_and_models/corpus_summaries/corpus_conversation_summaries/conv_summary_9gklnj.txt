Original Response: 
I see some people talk about alternatives to YEC (Young Earth Creationism), but I feel like no matter where I go, there is no church that publicly adopts this alternative, no radio station that is willing to discuss, and anything outside of YEC in Christianity is a "fringe" belief limited to a handful of bloggers and some people on Reddit.
Everyone I meet publicly who is Christian is a hardcore YEC and Bible literalist.
&amp;#x200B;

To me, it comes down to one of these being true:

1.
There is a worldwide conspiracy between Satan and the scientific community, where evidence contrary to the literal interpretation of Genesis has been either planted inside the earth by Satan, i.e.
dinosaur bones, or any evidence of Creation is intentionally altered, i.e.
carbon dating, or either destroyed, or immediately rejected by the scientific community.
2.
The Bible doesn't go too deep into detail.
&amp;#x200B;

Occam's Razor tells me #2 makes more sense, but whenever anything scientific is brought up around my Christian friends, they all end up leading to #1, so I have learned to keep my mouth shut.
This makes having a community of fellow Christians in my life very hard.
&amp;#x200B;

Personally I am fairly new to Christianity.
I try to make time to pray and study every day, but I feel that nothing can shake how silly #1 sounds, and perhaps stories written and simplified for people 5000 years ago to help people believe in the Creator didn't have the intention of also being the basis for understanding the precise nature of the world, i.e.
our body is made up of cells, besides no mention of it in the Bible, and I don't think Satan hacked everyone's microscope to make them believe in cells.
&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to disrespect anyone or alienate the few Christian friends I do have, but it doesn't make it easy to turn to Christianity when I can't talk openly about this, as the few times I have broached the subject, I get a shut-down, closed-minded response, or a link to some website that was written in the same style as whack-job UFO conspiracy sites.
&amp;#x200B;

One family I am friends with gave me a list of "non-negotiable truths" of what it means to be a Christian, part of that is believing in the Bible without question (Biblical inerrancy).
Does that mean to have questions is not Christian?
I have Mormon and Catholic friends who also wouldn't make the cut according to that list, so am I not allowed to call them Christians, and must I assume that they are hell-bound?
&amp;#x200B;

What should I believe?
Is my soul just being held from heaven by Satan because I refuse to believe the science conspiracy?
Is believing this conspiracy requisite for salvation?
I thought it was about accepting Jesus Christ as my savior.
I want to teach my children how to be a good Christian while also teaching them how the world works, which is the goal of science.
I feel this shouldn't be mutually exclusive, but according to the only Christians I know in person, they are.
I always feel science is about finding "God's fingerprints," whereas any Christian person I talk to apparently thinks science means "reject God."
Earth is young, but it was made to look the way it is.
You see God like to skip the evolutionary progress since he’s not confined by it.
&gt;Earth is young, but it was made to look the way it is.
That would make God a deceiver, which he is not.
No definitely would not make him a deceiver.
It’s like saying ‘God can’t heal because that would make him a deceiver for he is breaking the laws of nature.
Who says he needs to operate by those terms?
&gt; No definitely would not make him a deceiver.
It would.
And why would God do such a thing anyway?
Tell me why would God wait on evolution?
We know God created Adam and Eve to look old yet they were just created.
I could argue that God created the earth and heavens before the sun and the moon as Genesis says on the fourth day.
It just shows Gods power and that he is not dependent on laws of the universe to create things.
Adam and Eve were not literal people.
And what's a few billion years to God?
&gt;Adam and Eve were not literal people.
“Therefore, just as sin came into the world **through one man**, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—

But the free gift is not like the trespass.
For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that **one man Jesus Christ** abounded for many.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭5:12, 15‬ ‭ESV‬‬

&gt;And what's a few billion years to God?
He is outside space and time, he can not be confined by something he created, logically.
Making a literary reference doesn't indicate that the one quoting considers the quote literal.
We shouldn't read accounts not meant to be taken literally as literal.
There’s nothing to suggest it is not literal for the simple fact that Jesus is also in the passage and we know he was literally one person.
Yes, it totally would.
It would mean that God designed the world specifically to deceive those who tried to understand it.
We have a word for people who do that: liars.
Again then we would also have a problem by that logic with the idea that God created the universe out of nothing.
&gt;Earth is made last Thursday, but it was made to look the way it is.
How is this any more provable than your original statement?
FWIW, *Ex Nihilo* is not actually in the creation text.
Jewish theologians note that in Genesis, God created from the Potential, or the Void, or any number of translations that are not Nothing.
So, yes, there's also the problem that God created All from Nothing, but that's not really a problem since the Bible itself doesn't say that God created the universe out of nothing.
Because you were here last Thursday and you know that to be true.
You were not here 8000 years ago.
&gt; So, yes, there's also the problem that God created All from Nothing, but that's not really a problem since the Bible itself doesn't say that God created the universe out of nothing.
Says he spoke everything into being, so technically is from nothing in the space/time/ matter sense.
&gt;Because you were here last Thursday and you know that to be true.

I would say the same thing to you about your premise and neither of us will have gotten anywhere.
How do you know that Genesis is true?
Where you there?
&gt; Says he spoke everything into being, so technically is from nothing in the space/time/ matter sense.
Want to try to source that [from scripture](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1.htm)?
You're adding to what was said to say it was "from nothing."
If you want to make that claim of theological meaning, you can do that, but it's important to note that you are making a claim of theological meaning *beyond* what is in the text.
No I was not there but I know it’s true because Jesus was there, he said before Abraham “I AM” if Genesis was not true he would have pointed that out.
&gt;No I was not there


Then how do you know its true?
Or are you relying upon the word of others?
&gt; but I know it’s true because Jesus was there, he said before Abraham “I AM” if Genesis was not true he would have pointed that out.
Thats what the text says but how do you know thats really what Jesus said?
Were you there?
Genesis literally says “God said: let there be” like 10 times.
John 1 says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.”
‭‭
Jesus is the Word through which everything was created.
It’s back by the scripture 100%
Hah, obviously not but I believe in God so there’s no issue with my argument.
You can argue that the Bible is not true but that’s not my position.
&gt;You can argue that the Bible is not true but that’s not my position.
Thats exactly what i am arguing.
Its on you however to prove or justify it to be true.
That’s fair.
What I was arguing for is that it is not incompatible to be a Christian and believe in a young earth.
With a God involved there is no reason to believe those memories couldn't have been made last Thursday.
&gt; Genesis literally says “God said: let there be” like 10 times.
Actually, it says הָיָה (Transliteration: hayah :: Phonetic Spelling: haw-yaw) a bunch of times.
The [definition is more](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1961.htm) "to fall out, come to pass, become, be"

John 1 was not written until centuries later, even if we back-define Genesis through it, and even if we keep the English "let there be" translation of Genesis 1, that **still** doesn't say "out of nothing."
You can read that in; that's fine.
But the text does not say that.
Some of us take the Bible seriously enough not to force it to say something it does not actually say.
But it does say that it was created thru the Word.
And Genesis also says that God said.
&gt; But it does say that it was created

You mean [בָּרָא](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/1254.htm) (Transliteration: bara' :: Phonetic Spelling: baw-raw'), which means to *shape* or create or form into?
That verb does not require "out of nothing", and may preclude it.
&gt; And Genesis also says that God said.
Which has no bearing on whether there as anything there when God uttered.
I linked you to the [interlinear](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1.htm) on this.
If it was really there in the text, you should be able to demonstrate it.
If you want to *believe* that it was *Ex Nihilo*, go for it.
I encourage it if it helps your faith.
I'm not *against* the idea myself.
I simply want to be honest about what we can actually read in the text, and what we believe based on our extrapolation of the text.
And *Ex Nihilo* is an extrapolation that we do or don't believe.

Yes, but now you and /u/izbitu got lost in the thread.
Is God a deceiver or not?
