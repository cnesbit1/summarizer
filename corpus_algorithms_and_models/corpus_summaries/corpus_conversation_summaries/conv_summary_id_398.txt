AutoNation is pretty good, but if you're willing to travel, it might be worth it to avoid local cars with possible salt damage.
I second AutoNation.
In 2003 we bought a 2001 Honda Accord V6 from AutoNation's predecessor, Champion Honda.
I'm still driving that car today.
I third the recommendation.
I have no experience with All Star Mitsubishi but I've never heard a good thing about them.
I'd say avoid them.
I had better service at Lithia Dodge than Autonation.
Autonation did the wait game even though I had my own financing.
At Lithia, I was in and out during my lunch break.
All of their pre-owned vehicles are inspected and come with a few months warranty if factory is expired.
Bought a 2015 Lancer for $11k with 20k miles.

Summary: 
At Lithia, I was in and out during my lunch break.
