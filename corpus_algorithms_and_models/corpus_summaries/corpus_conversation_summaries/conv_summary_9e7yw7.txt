Talk about your day.
Anything goes, but subreddit rules still apply.
Please be polite to each other!
So scared .
N levels start tomorrow.
Just do your best :) good luck!
Thank you :)
And remember it’s not the end of the world if you don’t do great, even if it seems like it is.
I didn’t do as I expected for my final exams (partly my fault because I slacked lol) but that’s life, man.
At this point there’s not much you can do to revise, if you’re ready then you’re ready.
Just get lots of sleep and drink plenty of water so you’re focused and alert tomorrow.
Again, best of luck!
:) thank you so much appreciate it ya.

Had a margarita last night with the history teacher, he’s starting to grow on me.. he’s a pretty good kisser.
just curious - how do y’all define a *good kisser* like y’all can remember and rank meh??
but then again i’ve only got a sample size of 2 so idk 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃.
Sample size of 1 🙋.
No sample size, how to know :/
Till then, eat Hershey Kisses and rank the flavours to your preference.
this is like plot twist for a lot of romance manga lol.
