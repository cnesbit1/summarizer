24-hour volume on CBP is so low: &lt;3400...and dropping.
Sunday doldrums.
Don't worry about volume.
It's exactly as it should be at this point in time, with this lower volatility, and with little to gain in trading.
Plus if you knew the numbers being traded in OTC, most people's jaw would drop.
What matters is the fundamentals.
Crypto development is showing no signs of slowing down, that's for certain.
Build it, and they will come :).
There you go again ...... "most people's jaw would drop".
None of us including you have any clue on this and yet you are willing to make a wild claim just to make BTC look a little better.
Wow bitcoin really butthurt you didn't it.
You keep making your asinine comments.
I have never seen anyone reveal such desperation to convince others that Bitcoin is going to fail.
I think you should go shout at kids to get off your lawn and call it a day.
Gosh ...
I'm riding my short all the way to the bottom and you are losing your pants.
So who's really hurting?
Well I guess you may have also shorted during the time bitcoin was stuck in the 200 to 300 range in 2015.
But obviously you wouldn't let us know how that one went, would you?
After all, things actually did look a lot bleaker at that point than it does today not just because of price but because of the mt gox hack, much lesser mainstream interest, etc.
I also answered in a separate post about your concern of 'better tech' supplanting bitcoin.
The only short I took was coming off the ATH and it's simply a hedge for the coins I had.
Prior to that, I used it to buy plenty of stuff and just happened to have a pretty healthy balance when it went off the chart.
Neither me nor any of my friends even tracked or cared much about the price beyond the usual conversion back to fiat when we buy stuff.
So my viewpoint is that it was useful, not a big game changer as only anonymous sellers insisted on being paid with it.
And certainly not what I consider to be an investment vehicle.
You just got lucky that's it.
One could have taken the same view in beginning of Sep last year at 5k and been smug about it in mid Sep when price retraced to 3k.
Only to look like a dunce again in a matter of 3 months.
Hence there is no point feeling smug about one successful trade.
If that's the approach then looking at the wider history of bitcoin, argument would be bulls favour game set and match.
Instead I like to rely on qualities of Bitcoin to argue why it is set to go higher.
Probably you if you're setting up shorts on such an established bottom.
You're on margin waiting for a break may never come.
He he, I am far from losing but if that makes you feel better to think please be my guest :).
So you're shorting and coming on here every day hoping to convince reddit users that Bitcoin is doomed?
Nobody is that stupid.
And really ...shorting now?
October?
Boy you are doing this wrong lol.
Volume is the only thing oeople should worry about.
If it is going to succeed people need to be using it.
If you mean succeed as a currency then yes, I'd agree.
But we're not quite there yet and I'm confident that we will be in time.
That's why I said at this point in time.
Bitcoin was created to function as a currency,  but over the past decade it's forged out a place as an investment, outstanding accounting system on an incredibly reliable blockchain network, and laying down the groundwork to become digital gold as a store of value.
It's fair to say it's use as a currency has been postponed and will share the floor with the above.
Just to be pedantic it's not an investment, it's a speculative bet based on scarcity.
When a fund or investor buys shares in a company or property, they are buying a small portion of a revenue producing asset.
This is the as buying USD or gold.
You're not investing in USD, you're hedging or speculating or both.
