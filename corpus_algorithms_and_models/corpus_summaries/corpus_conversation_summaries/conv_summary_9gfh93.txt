**If period sex makes you squeamish or isn’t your thing, I highly suggest you don’t read this post.
Even if this post ends up being short.
I (30F) just started my cycle today (hooray!
my birth control is working) and maybe a few hours ago...this surge of hormones rushed through me and I immediately wanted sex.
I’m in a relationship with my partner (28M) but, when we spent the day together yesterday, we didn’t have sex; sometimes our time spent together doesn’t culminate in sex.
Thing is...he doesn’t like period sex, which is fine, no qualms there.
However,we have a sexually open relationship so, I do have one or two play partners I’ve kept around.
But...none of them are into period sex.
Which is why I came to Reddit to vent my period-hormone-induced-need-for-sex frustration.
🙃.
Where ya from?
I’m always down for it.
Feels great.
Missouri.
Man if I lived closer maybe I could satisfy your cravings ;)
Lemme guess...you live on the East or West Coast.
Yup, east coast :(
:( is right.
Besides, I have never experienced period sex but it sounds amazing.
Trust me...it is.
I’m horny now just talking to you about it.
Dammit why do we have to be so far away?
🤷🏻‍♀️.
I have been trying to relocate, maybe this is a good reason to move to the Midwest ;)
