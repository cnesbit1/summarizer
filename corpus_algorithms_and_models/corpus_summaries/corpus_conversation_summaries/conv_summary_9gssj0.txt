Just about everything is up for trade other than my Rayquaza collection.
Also have some Poipole and LL codes for trade.
(i'll entertain any other event offers for these. )
Heyo!
Is your NHK Jirachi ENG-tagged?
If so, I'd be interested in a trade if you see anything something you like [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iAE1XshcuOBiOMJkmE8OKdm3hvmZrtglwECLbk2_mio/edit#gid=625083344) !
Jpn tag NHK Are you trading that Pop Up Sylveon?
Ooh I already have a JPN-tag NHK, so I'm just looking for an ENG one right now, sorry ;-; thank you for looking, though &amp; good luck w your trades!
So pop up Sylveon isnâ€™t for trade?
I would consider trading her for something I'm specifically looking for on my wishlist, but otherwise not!
Iâ€™m not able to see your wishlist because iâ€™m on mobile, but what rates would you be looking at for those pokemon in your list?
oh sorry - I don't keep a copy of my WL on my sheet, so understandable that you couldn't find it haha.
I meant that I didn't notice anything on your sheet on my WL, but if I've missed something/you have it hidden away, the events I'm looking for are:

- ENG NHK Jirachi (preferably Timid/Modest, but open to other favourable natures)
- Parade Ditto
- 2013 Tanabata Jirachi.
ahh, thought it was mobile view that was ruining it.
Youâ€™d go 1:1 for any of these?
I had a tanabooty, traded it away though ðŸ˜­.
I would trade her 1:1 for a JPN-tagged ditto (can add something smol like a wifi on my end).
I would be a bit more hesitant to trade Sylvie for an NHK tbh, as I value it a bit less and I'm hoping to find one on exchange at some point!
what about for the tanabooty?
I think a 2013 tanabooty is worth more than a Sylvie for sure and would add :L.
2013 specifically?
Is there a difference in OT/ID?
Ye, different OT/ID and some unique moves (: I'm collecting as many different Jirachis as I can, and that's pretty much the last one I need!
ahh gotcha, are you trading that Arcanine by chance?
Proooobably not, mainly because it took me ages to find, and I don't think I would ever be able to find a replacement for it xD sorry about that, but best of luck with your trades!

Summary: 
what about for the tanabooty?
I had a tanabooty, traded it away though ðŸ˜­.
Is your NHK Jirachi ENG-tagged?
Is there a difference in OT/ID?
