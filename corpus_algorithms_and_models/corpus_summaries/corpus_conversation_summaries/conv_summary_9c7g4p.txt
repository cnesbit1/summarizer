Original Response: 
There is a YouTube channel that does some great movie analysis that break them down to their psychological, philosophical and even spiritual levels called Like Stories Of Old.
I have noticed that many of the arguments are regarding the morality or nature of God and I feel like his most recent video draws some parallels and may answer some questions or at least be thought provoking (for both atheist and theist alike).
The analysis uses the Lord of the Rings movie, here is the link.

I'm simply sharing, whether you're an atheist or theist you have the right to draw your own conclusions take what you may or may not from the video.
View at your own curiosity.

As pointed out in the comments, this is a debate sub.
So here is my proposed debate

My debate is that God is moral and requires a step back to see it, and I'm asking atheist or theist to retort to the idea of "the guiding hand" idea proposed in video and debate on wether this is flawed morality.
***EDIT 2*** 

while I would recommend watching the video because It does a much better job of showing what exactly is meant by "guiding hand" because I'm sure you know what that means already (the video just shows why  and how this works by means of the film)

But a basic outline would be, that God allows freewill so we are able to participate in creation itself and shape it how we want, similar to giving a child art supplies and allowing him to draw whatever he wants without us telling him how or what we should draw.
That we are not completely left alone, there is something found in life which we could call "grace" or "lucky coincidences" that sometimes pull us out of situations

That we are responsible for the means, and God for the ends

That God doesn't necessarily require praise and that ultimately what saves the world deepends equally on our own actions but like the first example I gave, God would be like a parent supplying art supplies for us to draw with

Therefore God may still be seen as a good and this could be the his very nature.
