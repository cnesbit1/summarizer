Original Response: 
Its funny.
I have a few conservative white friends who tell me racism doesn't exist in Australia.
But all my friends who are non-white tell they have experienced racism at some point.
I feel like people see racism as this negative, evil concept, and immediately distance themselves from it because at some point they decided that they are a person of decency and goodness - and they extend this goodwill to friends, family, colleagues etc.
It’s something people just aren’t willing to be introspective about.
Racism doesn't exist for white people in Australia until you go to an indigenous or ethnic community and involve yourselves deeply within that community and then hear all the stuff they were too afraid to say to you in person.
It's just normal human behaviour for a majority group to prejudice or discriminate anything that doesn't conform to their views.

A (non-white) friend of mine once told me this: a white person in Australia can, should they so choose, not have any contact with or be subject to the decision making of a person of colour.
The opposite is not true for the vast majority of migrants, and people of different ethnic heritages.
A white person usually has the option to remove themselves from a situation where they are racially discriminated against, or suffering potential aggression due to their ethnicity.
That's not to say that racism is OK.
However, non-white people are impacted by it much more.
For them, it's largely unavoidable.

100%.
It's unlikely, I think, but some official body needs to run campaigns [like this](https://youtu.be/g9n_UPyVR5s) in Australia.
I first saw this on Gruen Transfer and was blown away by how good it is.
Tasteful humour about a topic that it's hard to do humour about, in particular it uses irony so it doesn't insult the viewer.
And it breaks down the idea that racism is some drongo screaming at a brown person on a bus, like you said, and invites introspection.
That's because the left treats it that way, they've made even uttering a phrase that can be vaguely interpreted as racist decades ago behind closed doors something worthy of being fired, raked through the coals on social media and ostracised for life for.
Hell, they've made your father saying something that he had no idea was racist 30 years ago something worthy of being punished for.
And then they turn around and act all surprised when they get pushback to their insistence that everybody's racist.
Nobody wants their life ruined just so lefties stop whining for five minutes.

Damn, 10/10.
It brings up a good point as well, just because some people see racism as just something stupid people do, no matter what colour, doesn't prevent the fact that other people can have a different, less accepting response.
Maybe something that is a simple brush off the shoulder for one person is a panic attack for  another.
To have to deal with all those small little things in the day to day public experience, or live in a town that's progressive enough that you wind up in a safe bubble making generalisations about the whole populations experience when it would be different from regional town to city to bay to outback.
We should all try to avoid speaking on behalf of other people.
Which even I recognise is difficult, but in a topic like racism, I definitely think it doesn't benefit from limited perspectives.
Racism exists but its not as terrible as some people seem to think.
At least in my area, but I certainly don't hang with racists.
I only have one white friend...so maybe I am missing something.
Why are they your friends if they believe such stuff?
Because sometimes I enjoy people's company even if I wildly divergent views from them.
Do you challenge them?
Of course.
We have very heated arguments over it.
Not that it does much good.
I've a few conservative friends who say much the same thing.
They've also said a few things about Jews and Black people, and Asians...
