Good day, friends!
I am looking to add to my collection of Apricorn Ball Pokemon.
I'm currently mostly interested in Moon and Love Balls, but I'll probably accept anything I don't already have :)

Here's my [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DK6G_Y8mfjdg550jbRfEv72wvXp_oFWy5fWRuAi_qa0/edit?usp=sharing), I'd be happy to breed anything under the "Special Balls" Tab.
Hopefully we can make some trades!
Hi.
I have DBHA Remoraid and Smeargle that I can breed for Moon Ball Eevee and Fast Ball Hawlucha.
Sounds good to me!
I'm currently breeding for other trades, but I'll start working on those too :)
Alright.
I have yours done so just lmk.
Alright I've got pokes ready for you.
And I actually happen to have a ton of eevee's on hand, so would you prefer a Female with 5 imperfect ivs or a male with 5 perfect (they're timid)?
Oh nice, could I have a Female?
For sure!
Ive got you added and am chilling in the FP.
Thanks.
Sending trade request.
Thank you and thanks for the extra Berries.
(:
The pleasure was all mine!
Have a fantastic Sunday :)
You as well.~
