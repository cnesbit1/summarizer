Original Response: 
Looks more like an item people use for gold trading.
What someone does is list the item up for an obscene amount of money, the other person buys it and eats the 15% TP fees and irl money is exchanged hands.
Since it's so rare as a drop there won't be any confusion about which one to buy.
if they would use it for gold trading, those high listings wouldnt stay on the trading post, they would be bought out seconds after they have been posted and that transaction probably wouldnt even be caught by the API.
And if someone wanted to buy gold via RMT, they would probably have a hard time to cough up the 375g listing fee (for the 7.5k listing) in the first place.
You have me [confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5n6t6a/long_term_gw2_trader_ama/dc9adwb/)
Why don't you just get a guild and use the guild bank to transfer money?
Or does that have limits too?
Yeah I suppose that makes sense.
I just guessed that came from scams where the seller had just enough money to put up the listing and the buyer just ran away with the cash.
500g cap.
one thing people do to get around the gold cap is use ectos in place of gold.
per week.
Mystic Coins.
yeah those are used too.
what is confusing to you?
The comment i replied to was suggesting that items like these are used to transfer gold for RMT and i replied that those two listings arent used for it, otherwise they wouldnt stay listed.
you are confusing buyers and sellers here because in order for it being used for RMT, the seller of the item would be the buyer of RMT gold.
There is a deposit limit of 1000g for each guild bank tab and you can only withdraw 500g per week.
So transfering 10k gold would take 20 weeks, over 4 months.

Summary: 
yeah those are used too.
