Original Response: 
Should probably trade the plug.
I’m all for another Isles-Oilers trade haha.
Brock Nelson would be a good 1for1 imho.
Nah, it'd be Andrew Ladd.
You need someone who has shown that they can win the whole thing.
Chia would want Boychuk back.
Those Cup rings carry lots of value!
Whoa there, that’s a lot of grit/60 to just trade away Willy-Nilly.
We could trade our entire team for him and I’d be pretty satisfied.
Boychuk and Ladd for McDavid, salaries should work.
Back off buster, it's someone else's turn

We'll offer them, uhh...Polak is gone so...Zaitsev.
1 for 1.
Ok we'll give you a 4th as well.
Even better deal than Hall.
Delete this fam.
To LA for cash.
Somewhere Ray Shero’s ears are twitching in delight hearing one for one.
did someone say Willy Nilly?
McDavid-Nylander trade incoming.
I like you.
They should send him to Ottawa so he could try losing with the Sens.
Deal.

Lol.
Dear god no.
You and the Devils already had your turns!
Give someone else in the division a chance to trade with Chia!
Well fuck, maybe Shero should ask Chiarelli for a trade now.
Yeah!
Let the rangers give us another goalie.
My mans.
Wow.
Buffalo is so stacked now.
No take backs.
Well the last time they did it they won a Stanley Cup.
Seems like a solid plan to me.
Quick where's Martin Gelinas!
Deal, fax it in!
COLD BLOOOOOODED....ha ha ha.
if buffalo got mcdavid, eichel would ask for a trade.
