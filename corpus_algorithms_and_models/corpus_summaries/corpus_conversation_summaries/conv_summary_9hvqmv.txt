Original Response: 
Both sides of the camp very vehemently disagree with each other and say incredibly unkind things to each other and treat each other very poorly, but I can't even express how happy it makes me that at the end of the day people realize that it is in everyone's best interest to look out for one another.
Cory Fields pointed out in his write up that no matter what he thinks about bitcoin cash it is in his and the project he has an affinity for's best interest to responsibly disclose bugs to them because in the future it may turn out to be the case that someone on the other side will have information about a critical vulnerability that he would like to have responsibly disclosed as well.
Fast forward to today and here we are.
A critical vulnerability was found in bitcoin core and it was indeed responsibly disclosed to them and not kept hidden or sold or exploited.
I don't think I can even express how important this is for both bitcoin ~~cash~~ abc/sv/etc and bitcoin core.
I really hope this continues into the future or we are going to be headed in the direction of an inevitable disaster.
Thank you so much to both cory fields and awemany for setting such a precident on both sides.
I hope this continues to be the case into the future.
There is no bitcoin "cash".
There is *bitcoin*.... And *bcash* (...if it still exist at all).

I think you're perfectly within you're rights to consider another project worthless and refer to it as such, but there's no need to be so tribal as to pretend that there aren't a group of stakeholders supporting an alternate project called bitcoin cash.
You should be able to articulate *why* it's not a worthwhile consideration, pretending that it doesn't exist is just intellectually lazy.
I think we can agree that it's intellectually dishonest for them to call their forkcoin "Bitcoin Cash," but it's also intellectually dishonest for us to claim that "Bitcoin Cash" is not what they chose to call their forkcoin.
It is.
We can call it "BTrash" and "Shitcoin Crash" and "Bitmain Coin" to make a statement about its legitimacy and value, but to deny that its given name is, regrettably, "Bitcoin Cash" is to be a truth denier.
That’s not the point they are making.
The bcash community has coopted the name bitcoin specifically to confuse people and make them believe it is the original bitcoin.
It is extremely important that we refer to bcash as bcash for this very reason.
You’d be right if it weren’t for their community referring to bitcoin as bitcoin core.
Since their disinformation campaign has not ceased from making false claims and intentionally trying to mislead people, it is important for us to make the clear distinction by referring to it as bcash.
They're scamming people by using the misleading name.
How is Bitcoin Cash (BCH) misleading?
I am so sick of this!
The best way to get people not to use any of it to keep this bullshit up.
Move.
On.
It sounds like bitcoin, and many people have already been mislead into buying bcash when they thought they were buying bitcoin.
Actually I disagree.
People flock to drama while claiming they hate it.
It’s totally irrelevant to the average person.
Nobody gives a shit about these legacy battles or how many digits you have in your wallet you want to protect.
They care about what works.
Can this block size debate die already?
They forked.
They lost.
Let’s bring them back in or at least stop feeding the nonsense.
To an outsider it looks like two kids fighting over a ball in the playground.
The average person is also an idiot.

That's fine.
But bitcoin dot com sells something called "Bitcoin Core" instead of Bitcoin and that is misleading.
The BCH community in general supports that behavior so they are misleading.
