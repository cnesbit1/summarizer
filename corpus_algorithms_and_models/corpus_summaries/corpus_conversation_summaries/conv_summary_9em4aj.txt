Original Response: 
Has there been any recent update on this?
Is it still evacuated?
There is an excellent and long thread over at Above Top Secret that claims to have some inside info from folks who've called local newspapers in the area.
It's a pretty wild scenario that leads me to believe that the government is using the observatory in the name of national defense, possibly to keep an eye out for a new Russian space threat.
Ats still exists ?
Wow.

Awesome Iâ€™ll check it out!
ATS actually had one of the most eye-opening threads ever, in my opinion, in the last few years.
It was by a gentleman claiming that the Phoenix Lights craft, and others like it, are essentially "Mind Hoovers", and they utilize the consciousness of millions of beings to store and then recapture star map data.
That's why they seem to be completely unperturbed in their flight path, the fact that they're 100% visible, and the duration they were in the air.
Do you have a link to that thread?
I found ats after 9-11 there is some wild shit on there.

Please tell me you have a link for this!
?
He's talking about the Astro thread.
Seriously my favorite thread ever.
It's A LOT of reading, but I highly suggest going down this rabbit hole and reading both of these threads.
You'd have to read it to understand, but he definitely knew seriously sensitive information.
Astro has not been heard from since.

Thank you very much for providing the link - and sorry Condor for not providing it first!
I'd have to agree, in that it is also my favorite thread, since it made so much sense.
And Astro's disappearance just adds to the whole mystery.
Indeed!
The Astro thread containing the info on the Mind Hoovers is easily one of the best.
It would make perfect sense why they wouldn't want to disclose something like that to the public:

"Oh, and by the way, while you are all asleep, there are incredibly powerful beings pushing and pulling data into your brain, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it."
That would definitely upset a few folks.
I would take everything from ATS with a heavy dose of salt now.
Several years ago they had culling of sorts and banned multiple contributors.
Now it seems like it's been largely co-opted by the intel agencies as a outlet for misinfo.
Hearing this being linked to a russian "threat" just furthers my suspicion.
Thanks.
I had only slipped in there on a number of occasions and had no idea.
