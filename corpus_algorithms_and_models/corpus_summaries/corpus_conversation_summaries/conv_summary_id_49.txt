Original Response: 
A month ago we rescued a dog on Ocean Dr that was hit by a car and had dozens of burn marks(like torch marks that were verified by a vet).
She was REALLY pregnant and barely even walking.
Like I said, we took her to the vet and she made a full recovery.
They did check for microchip and other stuff but the vet said it was obvious she was a stray.Anyway, she had her puppies this week, and there's eight of them.
I desperately need to find homes for these puppies ASAP before they're any older.
I can post of pic of the other seven if anyone is interested.
The mom dog is also going to need a home.Here's a pic of the mom: http://i.imgur.com/YLY2dNv.jpgOne of the puppies:http://i.imgur.com/axCRH18.jpg.
The puppies do need to stay with the mom for six weeks, minimum, to be healthy.
Super cute though.
Yes, I just want to find them homes now instead of waiting until they're old enough.
Like someone reserving the puppy they want kind of thing.
There are so many that it's hard even right now to find homes.
Ahh, just being paranoid on my part.
Definitely get people reserving these puppies, they're adorable.
If you've posted on Facebook, I'd be happy to share the post for you.
I'm interested in a puppy or possibly the mom depending on her temperament, we have a one year old that loves dogs.
The mom is extremely mild tempered.
She rarely barks, in fact in the three weeks that we have had her I have only heard her bark once.
She is a bit forceful towards food, but it's because she was a stray and wasn't used to eating everyday.
Do you want to see all the puppies?
I can take a pic of all individually in case you may want one instead.
