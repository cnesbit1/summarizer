Original Response: 
Ah, Jean Grey.
I was wondering who she was going to be.
Is this newly announced or am I behind the times?
A little bit, it was announced one or two months ago.
However I'm not sure if if got a wider attention than fans of her or the franchise.
Eh, not sold on her.
Who the heck is Jean Grey?
marval character.
I think for the new x-men movie.
Oh, okay.
(I had a bad feeling it was some 50 Shades of Grey character....)
No, no, you're absolutely right.
She will play Christian Grey's younger sister in the sequel.Who don't want to see her in this nice fitting latex dress: http://i.imgur.com/znCBHcH.jpg;D.
Because she can actually act; she has no business being in those movies.
(:
At least X-Men probably gives us the chance that she can please us with her acting and also with her body in some tight costumes.
Quite behind yes.
Haha She will be playing Jean Grey, Ty Sheriddon will be Cyclops and Alexandra Shipp will be Storm.
