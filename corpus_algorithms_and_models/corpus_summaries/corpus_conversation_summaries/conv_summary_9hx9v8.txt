Original Response: 
Hello all, after going on the hunt for an easy to build and wick tank, I am going for the Pharoah Mini.
However, all I see built on the deck is clapton coils.
Will I be able to use normal 26g kanthal coils with no issue?
I am wondering as I can't seem to find anyone building with non-clapton coils.
I'm guessing I'd need at least an 8-10 wrap to get it spread out enough to get it to each end of the deck.... is an 8 or 10 wrap kanthal OK to vape on?

Pharoah mini users please let me know, thank you!
(all I have is 26g Kanthal A1 wire)
I’d got a little thicker because that many wraps is gonna be really high resistance.
You could do a parallel build.
It’s what i have in mine.
Thank you!
What resistance would you recommend?
By any chance could you post a picture on that parallel build?
Don’t have my pharaoh on me.
It’s just two strands of the same wire wrapped in parallel.
Really easy to do.
Gotcha, thank you.
Does this mean double the wicking?
No.
Gotcha, building noob here.
Would parallel building be like the middle deck in this picture here?

thanks for your help.
No although you could do that.
The coils are wrapped together.
Just take 2 pieces of wire and wrap it around the same rod.
Ah, ok.
Seems like it's not too much trouble.
How many wraps would you recommend?
Depends on what you like to vape at.
I’d do about 5 full wraps.
You count the wraps for both wires together so I will be 10 when are you done.
But you take both wires and turn then 5 times.
Gotcha.
What wattage does that fire at?
Thanks again.
Usually do 30-40.
