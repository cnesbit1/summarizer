Original Response: 
For example; I'm a Flames fan, Gio is the heart and soul of the team right now but father time is not on his side.
When Giordano eventually calls it quits, it sure is looking like our little shit disturber Matthew Tkachuk will be taking over as the captain for him.
Let me hear who you think your team will name to be the next Captain!
üëªüêª or Nolan.
However, You‚Äôll have to kill me to take Giroux away.
I think it will be Coots,TK, or Provy.
I doubt it will be Provorov.
He doesn't seem to have that leadership spark to him.
At least right now he doesn't.
TK could very well be that guy as it feels like he is the 'leader' of the young guys right now.
Patrick was a captain for Brandon so he is a good candidate as well.
Not sure about Coots, but he might be too old when G is no longer with the team.
Probably will have an A after Simmonds though.
In my opinion it'll be Couturier, he's 25 right now and has been with the team what seems like forever, plus a playoff hat trick on a torn MCL screams captain material.
The hell is TK?
Edit: Oh just figured out it's Konecny.
You guys need better nicknames.

Nah TK is a good nickname.
#GayforTK.
That's ironic, I've seen Leaf fans refer to Matthews as AM or AM34.
You're right, we should change it to Teaks.
Because he gets us hard as wood.
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre going to call Tavares JT as well...

Summary: 
At least right now he doesn't.
Nah TK is a good nickname.
You're right, we should change it to Teaks.
