Original Response: 
750 and 4000 individuals in a study is definitely close to the number of people in a city state of nearly 5.5 million people.

Hey, I'll take it over 'easily gamed online petitions'.
I don't think the results are surprising - people are becoming more accepting, but still slowly (and large chunks of the population are apathetic).
Regardless, attitudes can and have shifted rapidly in a decade or less in other countries (see the US), but don't count on that happening.
What’s changed in the US?
Antifas invading college campuses?
Actually, it is a representative if the sample set is randomized enough.
This is how sampling works and it's how majority of surveys are conducted.
Never studied statistics in school / uni?
Going from a wave of voter-endorsed SSM bans + majority disapproval in 2004, to majority acceptance and nationally legalised SSM (through the Supreme Court, but one clearly cognizant of public opinion), for one.
For a population of 5 million, a sample size of 750 and 4000 individuals would give you a 95% confidence level with a 3.58% and 1.55% margin of error.
More importantly, the 55% number is pretty heartening even if not ideal, especially when you consider the survey also shows an increasing trend of acceptance for the LGBT community.
I guess having churches brigade an online petition isn't exactly representative of how Singaporeans feel towards this issue.
Ohhhh.
Do you know how sampling works?
If they could ask everyone their opinion at once you think they wouldn't do it?
750 is a damn good sample lor.
For I think it was 3 or 4 questions that they asked.
If their methodology for picking the participants is random enough,then it should stand.
E.g.
If they just stood outside White sands on Sunday night and asked everyone you'd get 80% nsf feedback, which is terrible.
This is an opinion survery, and assuming a population of ~4mil (citizens + PR)  (https://www.population.sg/population-trends/demographics) 

Now, if we want the industry standard 95% confidence level, as well as a 4% margin of error, a sample of 600 is enough to be considered 'representative' actually.
3% would need &gt; 1065 

https://www.checkmarket.com/sample-size-calculator/

obviously a higher number would reduce the margin of error and deviation, but the 2 studies can be considered representative from a statistical perspective.
Wtf is with the label antifa?
Every decent human being should be anti fascist, you don't label people as antipedo, antiextremist...

Is a label fascist created to celebrate themselves.
Hmmmm yes, I clearly stated that I know how sampling works.
:O idk, I’ve just seen a lot of these groups of people in America destroying public properties and businesses on the web a lot, I don’t think they’re near decent yet.
Your interpretation of sampling appears to be “doesn’t fit my worldview means wrong, sample too small, gamed”.
Oh wow, you can read my mind, your interpretation is spot on!
Singapore is a very conservative country.
So the results are hardly surprising.
&gt;750 and 4000 individuals in a study is definitely close to the number of people in a city state of nearly 5.5 million people.
LUL.
Doesn't seem like you know how sampling works.
Yes, doesn’t seem like it.
Never go JC ah ?
Never go JC ah ?
Not when only 12% oppose it.
Which means 1/3 don't care, while more than half support the law.
It's human nature for people to not care to maintain the status quo.
Wow, how did you know I didn’t go JC?
You’re spot on!
Wow, how did you know I didn’t go JC?
You’re spot on!
Probably because you don't even understand H1 math, and you don't seem to have the intelligence to write a simple retort other than agreeing with sarcasm.
Also, you don't have the grace to admit your mistake, which probably means you are mixing with some bottom of the barrel crowd.
Which estate you stay in ?
I can probably make some decent changes to weed out your friends lol.
&gt; If they could ask everyone their opinion at once you think they wouldn't do it?
i guess that would be a referendum liao~
Sure, but it's a lot easier to convince those neutral about it, so that's some cause for optimism given the trend towards more acceptance.
Are you insinuating that non-JC kids are not intelligent?
You probably think you're one of those 'smart' kids.
Wow WTF?
You’re actually so right.
I didn’t have the intelligence to write a retort other than agreeing with sarcasm from not understanding H1 math.
Yes I have no grace to admit my mistake which also probably means I’m mixing with some bottom of the barrel crowd.
Damn you’re actually spot on!
Not really.
The problem here is that the law is already in place, so it's actually harder to convince people to implement change, rather than accept the status quo.
Feel free to wear the shoe if the size fits.
Most JC kids will know basic statistics, I'm not smart, I just have $$ to become become lawyer only.
Of course I'm right la ah boy.

It doesn’t invalidate your entire existence like how you’re invalidating the community’s does it?

Look at the US, France, Spain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Italy for counter-examples.
Also your assertion that the fall of the Roman Empire was due to homosexuality belongs on r/badhistory.
From a non religious standpoint, wouldn't it be morally uncompromising to not segregate people and embrace our brothers and sisters for who they are?
I mean why is the "right way" right?
What is it based on.
I think thats where both sides are coming from.
As of 2018, same-sex marriage is performed and recognized by law (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico,[a] the Netherlands,[b] New Zealand,[c] Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom,[d] the United States,[e] and Uruguay.
Additionally, Armenia, Estonia and Israel recognize the marriages of same-sex couples validly entered into in other countries.
Same-sex marriage is also due to soon become performed and recognized by law in Austria, Costa Rica, and Taiwan.
[f][1] Furthermore, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has issued a ruling which is expected to facilitate recognition in several countries in the Americas.
[g][2]

Are they crumbling as well?

Would you care explaining how giving gay people equal rights will lead to a "crumble of society"?
I sat for a lecture once about this and there is research to indicate that when homosexuality is outlawed, gay people tend to have a marriage for show and have kids which contributes to the population as opposed to states where homosexuality is accepted.
So the question for society would ultimately come back to "Is society in entirety more important, or is it the individual that we prioritise?"
This is indeed a tricky situation and we have people on both ends of the spectrum.
That said, it also does not mean that half the nation is homosexual, which also has a big difference.
I don't think anyone can say right now what is the "correct" way to deal with LGBT as a state.
The government is probably stalling/waiting on the long-term effects by using other states as a case-study to see what happens.
Then again, educated/smart labour is probably the only resource Singapore has, and we are only shrinking in population since the old days.
We don't know what happens if we throw LGBT into the mix.
[removed]
I personally don't relate homosexuality as a crime, so to me it isnt an issue.
The crimes you have listed would affect me directly and inevitably hurt the people around them.
So I can't understand the relation you're implying.
[removed]
&gt;Those countries all have their own serious problems.
These countries have some of the highest standards of living in the world.
I disagree with the fact that the problems they face are serious (relative to the rest of the world).
&gt;European countries have issues with Islamic overpopulation.
Are you fucking serious?
We have a higher percentage of Muslims than any single one of these countries.
&gt;Australia has some of the worst internet in the world, despite being a first world country.
This is irrelevant.
There is no link between legalizing homosexuality and internet speed.
&gt;But since you love fags so much.
Please tell me, in what way does a man putting his dick into another man's anus accomplish for society?
Gay men are happier, heterosexual people are unaffected, net benefit to society.
[removed]
So I assume the same goes for infertile people?
Them having sex must be illegal?
Since you rank  the concept of family so highly, should all married couples be forced to reproduce as well?
And how did gays cause Islamic overpopulation and slow internet speeds?
If you're trolling, you're not a very good one.
If you're not, you're not very smart.
Either way, it doesn't reflect well on you.
[removed]
I appreciate the effort, but I think you're being trolled and sadly, feeding it only makes it stronger.
[removed]
[removed]
Answer my first question about infertile people.
You're now saying that most married people already reproduce, and thus it is not required to force everyone to do so, since *there is enough children.
* 

If there is enough children, then why is homosexuals inability to reproduce being punished?
You also state that heterosexuals might change their mind, so they should not be forced to.
Are you now claiming that a possibility of reproducing is enough?
How is it unholy and unnatural?
If you’re using the Bible as reference, it also states that we can’t wear different cloths or save money, just to name some ridiculous example.
If you’re saying that the community can’t exist because of your religion, that’s overreach.
Also, Ancient Rome did not crumble due to the existence of homosexuality.
It was actually corrupted government officials, political stability and the invasion by barbarian tribes, to name some reasons, but definitely not homosexuality.
The community has existed long before the Roman Empire, if their existence can cause an empire to fall we wouldn’t be around to squabble over these issues now.
Please do some proper research before citing random examples.
Also, please don’t use the word “fag”.
You’re just embarrassing yourself by flexing your obviously extensive vocabulary.
I understand your perspective, you have your own morals and values that you live by.
You also also entitled an opinion.
[removed]
Homosexuality has been legal for over a hundred years in the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and Argentina to name a few countries.
Please come back in c.50 years and argue with us again when the community has most definitely taken over the world to prove your point then.
[removed]
What about the straight couples that willingly tear their family apart by divorce etc?
Also, adoption is a thing.
Same sex couples can adopt these kids who’ve been neglected by their parents.
And test tube babies exist too.
The times have moved on and so should you.
[removed]
As far as I remember, we’re currently an Aging population.
Sooooo I doubt couples are reproducing all that much?
Also, for the same sex couple thing, refer to my previous comment.
Adoption and test tube babies or sperm donors.
[removed]
[removed]
Really now?
Because historians and evidence prove otherwise.
Please present some evidence to prove how lgbt can ruin an empire single handedly.
Would be hilarious to see how a minority group that’s been ostracised due to conservatives have the power to take over the world.
Yes yes I agree!!
Human should also perish as a whole since not only did they destroy the nature, but also each other which is against the holy book that tell us to love our neighbour.
While we're in this topic we might as well destroy all technology because all these were caused by the accursed apple that the two original ate!
Furthermore technology was not created in the first six days hence it's unnatural.
/s.
“Homosexuality has been legal for over a hundred years in the Netherlands, South Korea, Taiwan and Argentina to name a few countries.”

From the guy above.
These countries haven’t fell into ruins have they?
What have the legalisation laws done but prevent the alienation of a minority group?
[removed]
[removed]
It’s still life.
Will you ostracise a kid just because thy were created unnaturally?
You can’t tell either way, unless your greeting to everyone you meet is “Hi, I’m homophobic and against ‘unnatural forms of life’, are you a ‘naturally born’ child?”.
[removed]
Adoption still means they’re caring for some straight couple who ditched their kid.
That’s showing that they actually have some heart unlike the couple that threw their child away.
[removed]
And still no evidence on how indulging in this “unholy” act caused them to fall,,
[removed]
It’s,, legalised,, 

Even if it isn’t legalised, like our current situation, people will still do it.
You just won’t know cause they aren’t flaunting it, similarly to those in legalised countries.

It's Singapore, pretty sure having NS already tells you the individual is as important as a used tissue.

In vitro fertilization has been a blessing for many couples that have other problems conceiving.
Are you saying their own children are not alive?
How does a nation with such high marks in education produce people this dumb?
Just pointing out that the "risk" you claim to exist is unsubstantiated by evidence and therefore is not true.
Alright.
Let me get this proper.
You say, a *straight* couple, who disowned a child, still contributes more than a *same sex* couple who adopts and cares for said child.
Sound like you’re just incredibly hypocritical and a bigot, yeah?
[removed]
[removed]
OMG you are literally a troll.
Nobody is even accidentally this stupid.
[removed]
[removed]
They’re still a family.
You ever heard what Obama said?
“What makes a man a man is his ability to raise a child, not make one.” Or smth like that.
Love is what binds a family together.
Not whether they have a child by ‘natural’ or ‘unnatural’ means.
Ummmm, sure.
That and a pair of testicles.

Murder and robbery actually harms people.
The existence of same sex couples don’t hurt you.
They aren’t all up in your face all the time rubbing in how they’re in a same sex relationship like how you’re rubbing it in all of our faces that you’re a homophobe.
Just say that you’re homophobic and leave with your conservative views.
[removed]
The government doesn’t take care of the child?
They’re left there in the orphanage by themselves, without the love of their so called ‘what would be in natural circumstances, Mother and Father’.
[removed]
This is,, the official definition of family “a group consisting of two parents and their children living together as a unit.”.
[removed]
[removed]
If you believe in the bible, you should follow it if it makes you feel good.
But to force all of us to adopt your definition, that’s pushing it.
Not all of us are Christian, yknow.
If you’ll excuse me, I’m tired of arguing with a homophobe who obviously can’t see how much of a bigot he’s being.
I’ll take my leave now.
[removed]
Fine.
Benefit of the doubt.
We don't grow babies to term in lab or clone humans.
Some infertility problems can include partial blockage of the felopian tubes (how eggs are delivered from the ovaries to the uterus).
It can also be due to decreased sperm count in the father.
Sometimes it is so bad fertility treatments simply will not work.
A "test tube baby" is one where the father's sperm is introduced to the mother's egg, then introduced to the uterus where, if all goes well, will attach and grow as if conceived normally.
At any rate, the argument that legalizing same sex marriage is bad for the population is ridiculous.
Gay couples are not going to conceive anyway because, well, they are gay couples, unless they have some surrogate to help, but under current rules, that will not happen.
So that whole argument is bunk, unless you are advocating rape rooms or something to deal with a shrinking population.
As for morality, by who's standards?
Supernatural rules?
Objective ethics?
You realize Singapore already hosts most major religions in close proximity , plus almost as many athiests as Buddhists, and takes a very dim view of one dominating the others, so this argument does not fly if you want to preserve racial and religious harmony in the country.
Are you worried this somehow affects straight people?
Why?
Are you uncomfortable with your heterosexuality?
If you aren't marrying someone of the same sex, how is it any of your concern to begin with?
Looking at this thread, you really do read like a troll, appealing to emotion and making some of the most uninformed remarks.

[Wrong](http://www.euronews.com/2017/08/03/transgender-man-gives-birth-to-a-baby-boy)

Well it is true that two cis men cannot give birth on their own, since they lack a womb among them.
But there are of course ways around that.
And two women usually will have a womb between them so most two-woman couples can give birth to a child.
[removed]
Even in places where LGBT people are well-accepted, people feel safe coming out, and are able to know that they themselves aren't straight/cis at a younger age, the proportion of LGBT people are still less than 10%.
So I'd say that the majority of relationships will still be between men and women, just as it is now.
Going by this metric, we should outlaw people falling sick and getting various diseases since that has detrimental effects on society as well.
Yes, perhaps gay couples are unable to conceive and bear children (on their own), but they still work, pay taxes and contribute to the economy.
You make it sound as if gays and the LGBT community is leaching off the country without any contributions.
Could you provide some numbers that back up your claim that "being gay has detrimental effects on society."
For example, we can quantify the cost of falling ill in terms of man-hours and associated costs.
According to the UN, there is an economic cost to the society when LGBTs are discriminated against:
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-real-cost-of-lgbt-discrimination/
How does this report support your claim?
[removed]
Let me ask you, are humans natural?
[removed]
Then how could anything we do be unnatural?
We are products of nature and any thing we do is also a product of nature.
[removed]
How about people who smoke or people who choose not to exercise?
That's not a chosen lifestyle?
Also, do you have a response to my question about the economic costs of LGBT discrimination to the society?
If not, I'll take it that you don't have any concrete proof for your statements.
Is the phone youre using to reply now natural?
Lethal diseases like measles are natural; vaccines that protect people from lethal diseases are unnatural, should we not get vaccinated and die from measles because it's natural?
I don't get people who generalize natural always equals good.
FYI, the animal kingdom do witness homosexual activities so homosexuality is ironically natural.
[removed]
[removed]
Answer my question about infertile people.
And yes, people certainly want to choose to be executed, what a great choice.
Just like how you choose to be straight, 10 year old kids also choose to be gay.
[removed]
Answer my question about infertile people.
Tell me, when did you choose to be straight?
And being gay is so much more about sucking dicks, it is about developing love for the same gender.
Just because you are incapable of love doesn't mean others are.
You want to be natural, you have to commit to all parts of nature.
Including the fact that humans are animals.
Humans have progressed so far in a civilised society because we have went beyond what was natural and used tools to help us achieve where we are today.
You cant just cherry pick what parts of the phenomenon you like and ignore the rest.
[removed]
[removed]
There will always be a % of the population that are homosexual whether you like it or not - legalising same sex marriage does not reduce the population of heterosexuals.
Being homosexual is not a choice, and it is in fact, natural - documented in 450 other species as well.
[removed]
You keep claiming that homosexuality is harmful to the society.
but can never provide any proof to back up your statement.
Just some vague statements about how it 'might' manifest in the future.
[removed]
[removed]
If you come out now, we won't judge.
[removed]
Once again, cherry picking arguments.
Talking about humans place in the natural world is another big topic on its own.
Back to the question.
Should people be allowed to take modern synthethised medicines or vaccines since they're unnatural?
[removed]
The same way IVF and test tube babies benefit childless couples (and society by your definition); the very unnatural means of conception you are against.
I'm sorry I'm not really seeing your logic; please explain to me step by step how does homosexuality lead to the destruction of society?
[removed]
So, slippery slope fallacy?
Legalising homosexuality does not mean that society will suddenly become completely homosexual in the future.
Try again, this time without the boring scaremongering.
[removed]
If that's the only argument you have, men are in trouble.
Scientists will soon be able to grow human sperm from stem cells.
When that happens, a fully lesbian society will be able to reproduce among themselves and propagate (assuming all their offsprings are also lesbians).
Will still need a womb for the embryo to grow, so too bad for men.
Your argument is also predicated on the assumptions that
1) it is possible for such a society to ever exist and has no grounds in any real statistics of occurrences of homosexuality.
2) homosexuality is a choice
Priests don't reproduce since they are celibate.
Hence they must be useless in the society and should be banned too.
Same goes for infertile people, people with genetic diseases etc.
One's value in society does not solely lie in his/her/their ability to reproduce.
Don't you think that different groups of people serve different functions in society and all can still play a role regardless of their fertility status?
Erm, out of your BS arguments?
Cat's out of the bag.
You're just a hateful person.
[removed]
Haha Nope.
humans are animals - taxonomically speaking.
In any case, you are the one that started the argument with the word “unnatural” meaning the opposite of “natural”, or “existing in nature”.
So are there different “natures” then?
One for humans and one for animals?
You are just cherry picking on definitions and adjusting your semantics around here.
Yes cannibalism is natural (as in we can observe it) but we consider it *immoral* - and hence illegal - because you’d have to kill someone to eat him, which we universally agree is not right in most circumstances (unless you find a random dead body to eat that doesn’t belong to someone else and doesn’t need to be cremated).
A Homosexual relationship does not cause any more harm than a heterosexual relationship.
Hence it is not immoral and should not be illegal.
There is a marked difference between homosexuality and cannibalism - so don’t try to conflate them into an argument.
Now, If you can point out why homosexuality causes harm apart from your nonsensical *“society is built on the family unit and allowing for homosexuality will destroy the whole of society”* argument, perhaps you’d be able to mount a better debate / troll.
But of course you can’t :) 

Once again, homosexuality is not a choice - like being left handed is not a choice.
All of your arguments in this thread is just fluff skirting around and not addressing this fact.
Are you telling me that a normal lifestyle is one that is full of hate?
Maybe that's normal for you, but not for me.
[removed]
Your argument started with the point that homosexuality is bad **because it is unnatural**.
How come now other unnatural stuff is suddenly good?
Are you picking and choosing now?

Keep telling yourself that hate is normal.

If you are a normal person, you would hate yourself cos you are spreading a mentality of hate to normal people who dont affect you in any way.
Enough with your pearl-clutching histrionics, this sub doesnt need close-minded bigoted fundies like you around.
Shoo.
And what reality would that be?
No my dude, I’ve already invalidated your point.
You just have a pretty weak argument and without any meat to substantiate it.
One more time for clarity: 
1) homosexuality is not a choice.
It is the way someone is, just like being left handed.
2) There will always be 2 - 10% of the population that are LGBT, regardless of policies, laws like 377a or attitudes of the conservative segment of society.
LGBT people will still be LGBT - maybe a bit hidden from view or suffering in the closet.
3) removing 377a or implementing same sex marriages will not change the proportion of heterosexual people in society - who, in your words “can form a family unit” etc
4) Society will not crumble.
The issue with all of this is that currently they are discriminated as a minority, and not accorded the same rights and privileges as the rest of us - that is unconscionable.
Now I’m willing to entertain your idea of “the family is the pillar of society” (which is a fair sounding ideal or value to espouse) but you don’t back this statement up with references, data or source material ... or anything - the onus is on you to prove what you are saying.
Shocking newsflash for you: guys are *already* getting it on, whatever the law says.
That's not going to change.
The crumble of Singapore empire has already begun mwahahahahah.
I won't reply to all of your comments but this is nonsense.
Adults having consensual sex in private hurts no other person.
Ireland legalized same-sex marriage a few years ago and it still has the EU's highest birth rates.
This is so ridiculous that it should be on a comedy show.
How do you explain the wars in the Middle East and other Muslim countries, then?
Homosexuality is illegal there.
&amp;#x200B;
Thing is, many of the country where homosexuality is illegal, suffer from overpopulation.
By the have kids, argument then sex using contraception or sex with an infertile person should also be outlawed.
Ireland legalized same-sex marriage a few years ago and it still has the highest birth rates in the EU.
A non harming individual is important.
Oppressing gay people for reproduction is wrong, you should promote tax breaks and compensations for people to have more kids .

&gt; Would you embrace murderers, rapists and thieves?
No, so why do the same for fags?
&gt; I would say homosexuality is a far less observable crime.
One that slowly erodes the foundations of society over a period of time.
Did you just relate homosexuality to crime?
Fucking idiot homosexuality is not any kind of crime, it can be at most marked as a disease but it's not even that.
You basically said you would punish/kill someone who has different feelings, opinions and priorities in life than you.
You would punish a person just because that person feels like a man inside of women's body for example?
When you commit a crime you willingly chose to do something you're aware of being forbidden.
Gay people didn't make any wrong choice in life by being gay, they were born that way.
It isn't something a person can choose and it definitely isn't something that threatens the "foundations of society" you fuckin' dumbass.
If someone needs to be punished and locked away from society it is limited and dull psychopaths like you.
And btw, usually the ones who express excessive homophobia like you are gay themselves.

Oh boy.
That homophobic coward deleted all his replies.
Lol

TL;DR: he said how test tube babies were unnatural, he was only preaching the good word of God, divorce is bad too, Ancient Rome fell because of the community’s existence, it’s a mistake for other countries to legalise it and they shall all fall too, so SG should not follow in their footsteps, also he kept flaunting his extensive vocabulary by using the slur “f/g”.
Most importantly however, straight people will forever contribute more than anybody in the community, even if they were the trashiest human being to have graced this planet, for the sole reason that they are straight.

Also, do you have a response to my question about the economic costs of LGBT discrimination to the society?
Would you care explaining how giving gay people equal rights will lead to a "crumble of society"?
Is the phone youre using to reply now natural?
So I can't understand the relation you're implying.
Also, please don’t use the word “fag”.
2) homosexuality is a choice
Priests don't reproduce since they are celibate.
For I think it was 3 or 4 questions that they asked.
Thing is, many of the country where homosexuality is illegal, suffer from overpopulation.
Don't have limbu is Kumar.
Legalising homosexuality does not mean that society will suddenly become completely homosexual in the future.
I don't think anyone can say right now what is the "correct" way to deal with LGBT as a state.
Hmmmm yes, I clearly stated that I know how sampling works.
Gay men are happier, heterosexual people are unaffected, net benefit to society.
Adoption still means they’re caring for some straight couple who ditched their kid.
And test tube babies exist too.
Then why are you discriminating against the lgbt community?
You also state that heterosexuals might change their mind, so they should not be forced to.
That said, it also does not mean that half the nation is homosexual, which also has a big difference.
You make it sound as if gays and the LGBT community is leaching off the country without any contributions.
