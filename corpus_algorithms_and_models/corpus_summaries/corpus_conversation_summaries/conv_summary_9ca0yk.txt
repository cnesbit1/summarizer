Original Response: 
One time, my family and I had just returned from Japan and we needed a big cab to load up all our baggage.
So this prime MPV turned up and he refused to take us because we live in Tampines.
On top  that, he was extremely rude.
Plus, he started arguing with the neighbouring taxi Drivers and he airport Marshalls promptly told him to leave, which he did.
Luckily another MPV taxi turned up, and the driver his round was SUPER friendly.
Taxis queuing at airport hates Tampines Pasir Ris Simei.
Cos they queued for hours on end and get a paltry fare.
wow I didn't know taxis queued at our airport for **that** long o.o.
I live in the West and I could always sense their glee after I tell them my destination.
you should see the queue at night.
I used to give the ones who don't make noise $3 to $4 on top of the fare.
But now I just Grab back.
They don't queue for HOURS la.
If they have to queue that long, wouldn't it make more sense to just pick up fares elsewhere?
yes hours - especially if you noobie go into the queue at dead hours like 2am - you can be there till 4:30am when the next flight comes in - and there is no backing out once you are there .... you are locked inside the queue....
