Original Response: 
How do you feel about your impending death, and the fact that it could be imminent?
Honestly, I can't wait.
Can you tell the class why?
&amp;#x200B;
Lol.
Because of my salvation from Jesus Christ.
I get to meet my father and leave the devils domain.. What more could I ask for?
Nothing.
Haha, thank you.
That's an excellent reason to look forward to dying.
That's why Paul looked forward to dying in Philippians 1.
I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something like "so I can be in hell with my friends" before i congratulated you.
Lol omg.
It is the internet, so I see why you would assume that.
But honestly yes, I'm so excited.
I'm even looking forward for my parents passing.
And it sounds crazy saying it aloud, but I always secretly think it's a good thing for them.
I can't wait til they get to experience that wonderful peace with our lord.
They deserve it.
I love them.
What if we just cease to exist?
We don't :)
Oh, I'm so relieved I found the one person who knows the answer to this question.
I'll just take your word for granted.
So we get reincarnated and get to live another life on this earth, yeah?
Is that what you're saying?
I'm not here to debate.
Have a nice night, it's like 3am at my zone.
I can see that.
You rather just assert things you can't possibly know as certain truth.
If you were open to debating things, you'd quickly have to admit that you don't know anything about life after death.
Good night!
Night c:
