Is that a bit of Abbott poking out from amongst the onions?
Looks like it!
And some of the potatoes have a Dutton face.
I think so?
(I do love Rowe's mixed art style though.
Gives me hope.)
Looks like eyes in the bananas too.
Not sure if I'm seeing things.
I've tried looking for a minute but I just don't see it.
On the top of the pile of onions are some pinkish ones with an eye and what looks like lips?
Made to look like onions, but could be interpreted as a face.
Wow, what are the chances that they go the same way, great minds...
What's the deal with the strawberries?
Some shit has stuck sewing needles into strawberries.
