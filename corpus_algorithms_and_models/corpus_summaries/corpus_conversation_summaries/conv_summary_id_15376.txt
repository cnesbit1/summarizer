Original Response: 
If you take a picture with her best profile, she could be "OK" at best...
I don't get all the love for her, she is not that attractive at all.
But I guess all the tastes are in the nature...( don't know if you have this expression in english ?)
I love Sophie as a person (she's awesome), but her looks are 6/10.
I can really understand that if you don't watch GoT and/or don't really know much about her you don't really get all the hype around her.
I watch the show and i love it!
I just think she is a 7/10 max.
Just my opinion.
Redheads are like driving.
2 and 10.

She kinda looks like young Lindsay Lohan.
Not what I meant, but ok.
Well, I like her.
