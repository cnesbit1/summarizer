Hi there.
I'm quitting the event scene, but I wanted to at least finish the 2018 Legends thing (esp.
this month since I love Latios and Latias).
Sorry for the longass trade title.

* NA Latios/Latias Codes

What I have for trade:
###
* NA Thundurus/Tornadus Codes (1 me :1 NA code/2 me:1 PAL Redeem)
* ~~3~~ 1 PAL Kyogre/Groudon Codes (1 me:1 NA code)
