Original Response: 
I haven't completed US yet but I have a competitive battle itch to scratch.
After transferring my mons from ORAS all I need now are certain items.
So, if you have any of the following items:

- Choice Specs/Scarf/Band
- Focus Sash
- Weakness Policy
- Life Orb
- Mega Stones
- Leftovers
- Eviolite

Then name any of these HA Pokemon you want: [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wT0LOjWHax1vvLG-me99jGU9AdQSahajifqFWfutpPk/edit?ouid=117524942999790038747&amp;usp=sheets_home&amp;ths=true) I will be trading 2 mons per 1 item, except for Eviolite which I will be trading 5-for-1 since it can only be obtained once per game.
Comment if interested!
I'll do one of anything for the totodile and spiritomb.
Would Eviolite be OK?
(Really need more of those)
That's actually the one I'd like to not give up, since I can only get the one D=
I can look to see if I can get a second one, but that'll need to wait till i get home.
It's also the one I really need though :(

Can I sweeten the deal by offering you more HA Pokemon?
As many as you want that are on the list, actually.
How about Weakness Policy then?
Done.
Could I get totodile and klink?

Unfortunately I already bred the spiritomb for you :(
Well darn.
Any other BP item you'd like for the klink in addition?

Also, I can trade at any time for the weakness policy.
How about 1 Life Orb?
(You can also find one on Mount Lanakila)
Done.
I'll take care of the klink for you sometime tonite or maybe tmrw.
Yup!
Everything's ready on my end, just hit me up.
