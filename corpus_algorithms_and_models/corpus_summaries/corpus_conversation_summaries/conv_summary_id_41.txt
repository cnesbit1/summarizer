Original Response: 
Spending my first holiday down here and looking for a tree farm that allows you to cut your own.
Closest I'm finding is San Antonio area.
Anyone know of anything closer?
Thanks!Edit: Looks like I'm driving to San Antonio this year.
Next year I'll cut one down and bring it with me before driving down.
Thanks for the replies.
:)
None that I know of bud, been here for 5 years in corpus.
If I find anything, I'll be sure to post it.
After a bit of searching I found [this](http://holidayhillschristmastrees.com/corpus-christi) website.
I've never tried or even heard of it, might be worth checking out though.Edit: I think they might be pre-cut actually.
Not sure.
Unless maybe you want a festive/ironic palm tree, you're living in the wrong region to cut your own Christmas tree.
Texas has them, but all the ones I know about are around Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio.
Our favorite one was up in Bastrop, but burned down a few years ago in the wildfires.
They're around, just few and far between.
Appreciate it.
I looked into it and it looks like they pre-cut and ship them in from Oregon.
I appreciate the reply though.
