Didn't know about her until Daredevil, but she is very beautiful.
Not seen True Blood?

&gt; the show is horribleIt wasn't bad.
It got worse admittedly but it wasn't horrible.&gt; the view is amazing.Now that's a terrible show.
Best part about watching it, is when your in public looking at strangers and trying to guess who is vamp and who isn't.

I loved the show in the beginning but was so glad I could finally stop watching it when it was finished.
A show about vampires, but this line sums up how I felt about where the story went.."Momma, the yakuza are comin!"

Summary: 
It's not all that bad a show.
