Original Response: 
Like the title says, I'm selling my car for BTC today.
It's a bit of a weird situation, and I'm half expecting the buyer to try and pull something stupid, but I figured hey as long as I'm doing all my steps correctly, as long as the BTC is being sent over and I can confirm that I should be fine.
What steps should I take to make sure I don't get screwed?
I’d be more worried as the buyer of the vehicle.
I’ve long been wondering about making big purchases with crypto.
What’s to stop the guy from saying he didn’t get paid?
If someone has an answer to that, I’d like to hear it.
Same can be said about cash.
Send directly to their coinbase account ?
Add your addresses to a receipt and both sign it that you agree those addresses are owned by the both of you.
Then he needs to send a test amount to you quickly, if it turns up in your account then he send the rest.
I guess that makes sense.
I applaud the original poster for accepting bitcoin for their car.
I hope more people are willing to sell for crypto in the future.
How’s that different from cash?
A bill of sale signed by both parties.
Depends on size of purchase.
Not many people are buying lambos with bags of cash.
They are with bitcoin though!
What stops someone from taking cash and saying there hasn't been made a payment?
Very true.
A signed bill of sale.
There’s no difference than purchasing with cash.
Sounds incredibly inefficient.
