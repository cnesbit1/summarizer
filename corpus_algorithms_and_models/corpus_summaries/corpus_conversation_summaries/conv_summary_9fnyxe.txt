**Submission Statement:**

How do you takeover a country who's armed to the teeth and aware of your takeover plan?
Trick them into being the ones who implement the plan themselves.
The election of Trump is the single greatest deception ever pulled on America in its entire history.
Greatest in it's potential impact on the future of the country itself and greatest in scale at which it was implemented from several different angles and over the course of decades.
You give one president too much power.
The next one can easily undo everything just by enacting executive orders.
His supporters give him too much power.
Good luck undoing Q when Mueller comes calling.
His supporters don't give him any power the people who sat home and didn't vote gave him power.
You're only as strong as your opposition allows you to be.
No, not true.
He is a malignant narcissist.
He literally feeds off of the praise and hatred he gets.
Apathy is the PERFECT antidote to him.
Without any attention, he'd wither away and die.
He doesn't know who he is unless he gets reactions out of people.
His supporters and his opposition both make him stronger.
Any pushback he gets from his opposition just causes and equal or more powerful reaction.
They ONLY people that can stop him are his supporters.
The people he currently views as "his" people.
If enough of them were to make a fuss, he'd change on a dime.
Trump isn't even a real human being, he's just a reflection of his environment and right now, he's a reflection of the ugly underbelly of America.
We're going to find out just how ugly it really is and it's not going to be pretty.

Yeah im cool with him being president over Hillary she called us super predators and her husband is the main reason were being mass incarcerated at the rate we have now on top of life sentences for non violent crime, ie three strikes policy.
See, this is the trick.
They are both AWFUL choices.
You don't have to support either of them.
In fact, I don't believe in supporting Presidents at all.
I support policies, not men.
The face or party name on the policy doesn't matter to me.
I will never defend an immoral thing a president does simply because I "support" him.
I am not emotionally invested in a team or in a side "winning".
I am on the side of our people and the welfare of the country itself.
You can't have policy without a person behind it.
And?
His supporters don't have to defend everything he says and does by deflecting responsibility onto everyone else either.
You don't have the right to complain if you think the only way to beat him is to be apathetic towards him.
That's an easy contradiction to see.
I have an entire subreddit dedicated to this.
Do you think I'm being apathetic in general?
I mean to him, as a person.
I don't care at all about trump the human being.
I care about his influence on the people of my country and the shared psychosis he has everyone under.
I am saying people shouldn't focus on him as a person.

Summary: 
I support policies, not men.
You don't have to support either of them.
I mean to him, as a person.
I am on the side of our people and the welfare of the country itself.
His supporters give him too much power.
I don't care at all about trump the human being.
They ONLY people that can stop him are his supporters.
