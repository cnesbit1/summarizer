Original Response: 
How do they physically fuse them?
?
Top ends of 2 r1 engines and a custom bottom end that can take them both like a v8.
Then a custom camshaft.
Or thats how i presume it would work.
Id imagine it works much like a v8 in trucks.
gorilla glue.
Yah I meant the bottom ends.
So he just milled a custom block?
Using a large hadron collider.
Probably took a few hours to make ðŸ˜€.
Probably had a case designed and casted from aluminum.
I was not aware you could cast something so huge like an engine block.
Thanks.
Flex Tape.
Anything can be done if your wallet is big enough.
Big things are very suitable for casting, if the alloy is right.
Yes.
Most engine blocks are cast the only exception being billet blocks.
Billet is a block that has been machined to shape from a larger chunk of metal rather than casted, which is very expensive because you are paying for 1.)
A giant chunk of metal and 2.)
Hours and hours of machining costs.
Early versions of the Sherman tank from ww2 were cast.
