Dude was wrong for the "adam &amp; eve" comment, but he's not wrong about the dress code blame.
Girls who don't know how to dress right at school ruin it for those that do.
They're ***absolutely*** to blame for strict dress codes that don't allow for shorts or skirts.
Guess what?
Telling everyone to blame a whole gender for not being allowed to wear shorts to school (in addition to everything else wrong in their lives) is horribly immature and completely inappropriate coming from anybody with any affiliation to a place of learning.
That's the kind of opinion that should be kept to yourself in that situation.

It's not an opinion; it's a fact.
The girls are who causes the ability to wear shorts to school to change.
Boys aren't the ones showing up to school with shorts riding up the cracks of their asses.
Girls do it every single time shorts are allowed in dress code again and then act like they don't know how to measure the length.
"Oh, I didn't know they were too short..."
Blame the administrators for deciding that girls' bodies need to be covered.
Blame teachers for not properly enforcing it.
Blame them for writing and communicating the rules poorly.
Blame the clothing industry for making tons of clothing that doesn't meet school dress codes (long shorts have gone the way of pockets in women's clothes).
Blame the male gaze for this being an issue at all.
No.
Dress codes that unfairly police girls' clothing more than boys' clothing is not the fault of the girls.

Neither are girls.

My high school had the same rules for both sexes.
No shorts for girls, no shorts for boys.
No tank tops for girls, no tank tops for boys.

Okay.
Still not something to blame girls for.
