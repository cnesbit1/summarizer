Here I am waiting for the Branded Skins to come back D:
I'm waiting on Anet to add the beetle to this pack or an option to buy it separately.
Exo-Suit Beetle wheeeen

Also: Anet announced they're adding yet another mount later right?
During the LS4.4 press hype one of the devs mentioned it in an article but I can't find the source off hand.
It makes me wonder if they're going to just do an LS mount pack later.
They did confirm a seventh mount, yes, it was in an interview with... one of the Mikes.
Don't have a link on hand either, but the detail stuck with me.

I want a Dolyak.
I don't know how or if it would be useful at all, but I want one.
Anet already said that they have no plans to retroactively add mounts to the packs already out.
Somewhat baffling because the awakened mount pack came out right before the beetle and didn't include the beetle (no golden scarab?
really?).
That choice right there is why I won't be getting any future packs since they aren't future-proofed.
If I shell out of a themed set of mounts, I want all my mounts with that theme.
That wasn't the article I was thinking of - Chris?
said explicitly (and I'm paraphrasing here) "we have another mount which players aren't expecting"

I remember it because when I read the "expecting" part it basically ruled out Aurene as a mount :(
I wanna be like those bastard evil dwarves hanging around sorrow's furnace in GW1.
&amp;#x200B;

Wroth the Yackslapper!
hm I remember a spider mount rumor :o.
I bet its Rytlock!
Half the speed of normal walking but a million hit points.
his fur is so soft.
It'll probably be for mountain climbing, bashing through snow drifts and breaking dense trees or ice walls probably.
I'm getting a whole "this is what we use to approach Jormag" vibe.
They can still add the skin for other mounts as a separate purchase further down the line I guess.
Especially for seasonal skins.
That would be sooooo amazing.
Not gonna happen because arachnophobia is such a thing, they already said.
It's a sad day to be Belgian.
on the contrary, just wait until all of the european countries adopt a similar legislation (it's going to happen soner than later), anet will not be able to continue offering lootbox style items in the gemstore because they can't afford to close the gemstore for all europe.
Exactly this.
Just make them selectable licences for all and everyone will be happy.
Well, mostly happy.
Except that will massively increase their price so a lot of people wont be happy.
I'll gladly take random and cheaper over getting to pick for 3x the price.
So do all in-game stores look different in Belgium?
(if they have rng normally)
I'd prefer random skin for a mount of my choosing for like, 600 gems.
Seems like a fair compromise to me.
Tbh the ideal would be to have every option.
Random whole pool

Random specific mount

Specific choice.
Price them each more expensive than the last and let people pick.
The problem is everyone whining about lootboxes and random rewards wants to eliminate everything but the final option.
There are plenty of people who think "Well some are cooler than others but I'd just like a cheap mount skin" and happily buy the cheapest random option and be happy with it.
See, I prefer WYSIWYG and pay a bit more.
Still cheaper than roulette ...
For a lot of people who know what they want the random license system means paying the cost of a single license multiple times anyway.
It's nothing but a scam to make players pay for something they don't want, and a far cry from "deeply customizable role-playing experience".
So buy the specific one or ask for specific ones.
Be prepared to pay more for them, but dont whine and bitch like some people are to get rid of an equally valid way to get something for cheaper.
I never want specific mount skins except maybe one of the whole set themed bundles, I would never buy a specific license skin, but over time I'm likely to buy multiple random ones because I dont really care which one I get when I buy those I just want a cheap skin.
No worries, we're working on it!
As soon as microtransaction gambling is no longer allowed in major regions by rule of law, the MT shops will be forced to either outright reduce price tag of the so-called "premium select purchases" and/or rely more heavily on discounts in order to promote sales.
A lot of online games already do this and it can work very well, and I'm fairly confident that ArenaNet will be able to adapt as well.
Most games dont do this and thats the problem especially F2P games.
If you dont want to spend absurds amount of money trying to play and earn anything in a game that doesnt have lootbox model is awful.
You will by far walk away with more and cheaper shit in a model that offers loot boxes than doesnt.
Even if I could purchase everything individually I still wouldnt because random is cheaper.
I'd like this, tbh.
I'm only missing 6 skins, and I want 5 of them, so I could choose which one I want first.
im the opposite.
&amp;#x200B;

I won't pay a dime for RNG.
Which is why both should be an option.
I dont care what mount license mount I get because in the end over time I'll probably just casually buy through them all with gold.
I wont ever buy a specific license because I dont care what I get I just want cheap skins.
Let people pay for the slection.
Some of the best games in their genre like Warframe, World of Tanks, Path of Exile, and even other purchase-to-play online games like Elite: Dangerous have nearly always had healthy microtransaction economy and almost or entirely without involving any microtransaction gambling.
There are of course many reasons why these games are successful, but the only cause why some games do microtransaction gambling is because they have been able to get away with it until now and because they are unable to offer any meaningful monetizable features otherwise – basically because of lack of imagination and effort.
While there are still a lot of games like GW2 which don't revolve entirely around loot boxes and other monetization scams like pre-order season passes, it doesn't mean that what they are doing is not against gambling restrictions in many regions or generally unethical, unfair and predatory business model.
The only reason you get "more and cheaper shit" is because *shit is made cheap in the first place* in order to be monetized in elaborate limited-time bundles or gambling boxes along with the prestige items that players typically want to customize their experience with.
Even th The very purpose of those simple raptor and skimmer recolourations, or any other trash microtransaction item, like majority Overwatch sprays and basic recolor skins for example, is to make loot box economy recurringly profitable to their publisher, at virtually no cost, along with providing "variety" from which the customer can "select from" and *not* to provide valuable or even invaluable customization options to you.
The goal is that you buy and keep buying, forever if possible.
By the way, ArenaNet would disagree with both you *and* me on this matter, as they made that statement while back about "standing behind the work of their artists on each skin" and *not cheap shit*, or whatever, but like many things in the game recently, it's quite obvious that even without any gambling some microtransaction content of same price tag just doesn't see the same amount of work as certain others.
If they were actually concerned about players getting what they want, they'd just make all the skins available at varying prices like any decent store.
You know, the ones that actually need to abide local laws.
The only saving grace for GW2 and ArenaNet in this matter IMO is because gold can be converted into gems in any amount.
Spending 125g for a random mount skin is a pretty good thing, but because what you get is random (*even* if I "progressively" make the license box more likely to give me stuff I might actually want, a luxury that Black Lion chest largely lacks), the whole gold conversion only feeds into the recurring profit element.
I'm no economist or psychologist, and I pay relatively little attention to wealth of other players, but I think this kind of system heavily emphasizes spending your gold to convert into gems and then buy more gems with real money to continue the gamble (or just to purchase regular gem store stuff – the ability to convert gold into gems primarily exists to make actual spending easier and to make microtransaction culture appear more tolerable, which isn't always a bad thing and can even be legit, honest factor in business, but the point still stands).
This got little longer than I expected so **tl;dr**: The actual contents of nearly any loot box have little to nothing to do with what you want as a player or even as a person.
I can get behind your notion that it's not a really huge deal about wanting a specific skin, but I don't believe a person exists who can't pick one or two favorites from those license boxes, and receiving merchant express from a Black Lion chest is nearly universal source of contempt or at the very least disappointment.
And that's the whole point the system thrives on, to essentially hold the desired object of your purchase for ransom and provide something else you didn't want in return of your money instead.
That doesn't change even if you don't think that what the loot box pooped out this time isn't the most hideous animal or useless convenience item on Tyria or even if the system is "progressive" and increases the odds of gaining something you may have wanted or something which you ultimately prefer.
The problem with most F2P games is that F2P players earn jack shit and in many cases NOTHING at all.
Most F2P games that offer a lot of cool things and rewards to F2P do it by handing out lootboxes and thats a good thing.
Ill take my hundred of free OW skins are all the free skins I got from LoL's lootboxes over having nothing at all.
I'll take the mount licenses being random over having to pay 2-3x more for a specific one any day.
I dont care if there a few I like slightly more because in the end I just want a nice mount skin, and over time I'll probably by so many of them anyway I want them as cheap as possible.
You can go ahead and buy any specific thing you want, but advocating nothing but "You can purchase this X thing right away" is selfish entitlement because thats what YOU want.
Without lootbox models many F2P games and B2P games that survive off cash shop people who dont pay any extra money would get literally nothing.
Those people like earning things and being rewarded for playing but no one gives a shit about that because they dont like it.
You're perfectly welcome to advocate for being able to buy what you want and thats totally reasonable and should exist.
The point is it should not exist at the expense of losing the cheaper random option a lot of people would rather take.
Why should it increase the price?
There's no real reason besides anet wanting more money to increase the price of selectable skin licenses.
That's entirely a choice, not a requirement.
Because if you think that even if they never released the random options that a selectable skin wouldnt be the price they are now you're delusional to how Anet prices everything in their store ridiculouisly high.
The selectable licenses are the base price, the random is a dicount.
If they remove the random there is 0 way in hell they are reducing the price of the selectable ones so all the will happen is you removed peoples options on what to buy.
[deleted]
Also RIP to ecto gambling and most of the mystic forge (or gems to gold).
But if you eventually want every skin or dont care what skin you're getting and just want A skin then I dont want the high premium price of buying a specific license.
And people who farm gold in game to buy things in cash shop certainly will be happy /s.
I can only advise you to try playing different kinds of games.
Everyone wants to spend money because that equals to gaining things in our minds and that's what human existence is largely about.
Video game cosmetics or even gameplay features don't belong to basic right to livelihood of course, but they rely on or outright exploit the similiar psychological and social triggers which promote us to seek social acceptance or items of physical value to us.
Still, many games do this in absolutely fair manner without seeking to blatantly exploit these unadaptable vulnerabilities for infinite profit, and ArenaNet also used to be able to do this previously to at least some extent (and they may be improving, who knows, but that doesn't mean we can afford staying silent on this topic right now).
There are countless ways to promote sales through added benefits instead of reduced deliveries, and if virtually any conventional business tried to do similiar things as the video game industry can, they would get shut down within a month in my region.
Consumers' rights being guarded by law and officials is not a globally available luxury, but video games are a global business and until they are watched and regulated more closely for potential exploitation of their customers, we need to take care of ourselves.
And that brings us to culmination of this conundrum: The issue you're describing is a problem for microtransaction designers and the company as a whole, not for gamers.
It's their job to sell and promote their products, not your responsibility to be able to buy loot boxes and compromise your own *or anyone else's* legal rights.
It's their job to make their items available to you, not the other way around.
Being able to buy more for less is never inherently a bad thing, but in this case it's a mathematically evident that on average we actually need to spend more to get less, and that is unacceptable unless you put absolutely no value on the products or your own money.
This is an excellent example of the kind of grip that microtransaction culture can have on players and the kind of monetization that some companies want to promote: "You always get something" or "we made it so it has value" or "this is a competitive price point" regardless of what you actually want for your money and of how little effort some of the items received, or regardless of the fact that the products are not conventionally physical items subject to any "supply" or, again, that loot boxes are actually against gambling restrictions throughout the world for fairly obvious reasons.
Video game companies need to follow same business laws as anyone else (thankfully many do), and ultimately they will have to, and they will need to learn to adapt, or die away and make way for their more successful competitors which already exist in online gaming.
