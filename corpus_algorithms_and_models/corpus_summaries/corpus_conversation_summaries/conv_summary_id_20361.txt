this is not how I imagined her.
Still hot imo.
Like a real woman?
Without photoshop?
At least she owns her cottage cheese like a real woman should.
Girls from Miss Reef are also real women and the have stunning bodies and [BOOTIES](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/d7/fb/84/d7fb847f3ed75a8bc77d2c2bf95451cf.jpg) and [THIS](http://file.thisisgame.com/upload/tboard/user/2014/03/25/20140325222057_9968.jpg), so that excuse of real women ?
Scarlett isnt like any ordinary woman who has to work almost everyday (8 hours per day) why scarlett cant go to the gym everyday for some hours?
Considering she had a baby, she still looks amazing.
I've seen younger childless girls looking way worse.

Look.
I like Emma, but she's 22 in that picture.
ScarJo is 32 with a kid.
College aged girls are not real women.
They're still growing into adulthood.
Their metabolism is still running at full throttle.
Show me a pic when Emma hits 30 and we can discuss her further.
Until then, just admit you prefer twiggy little girls.
