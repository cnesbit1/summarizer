Original Response: 
Damn it's the first time I've heard him speak since.
Sad to hear him like this.
I'm just glad he is alive.
It is pretty sad.
I thought he just suffered some physical damage but damn... guess not.
He was braindead for a good chunk of time, it's actually incredibly wild that he's alive after the amount of physical trauma done.
Yeah man, growing up watching this guy being a beast and one of the most intense competitors n seeing how this accident affected him... crazy.

Do you know how long he was brain dead for?
Or anymore information on what happened?
Thanks.
are you joking?
he says so in the clip: got hit by a fucking train.
[deleted]
he doesn't remember.

Ok, my bad.
sorrry.
&gt;Did he just show up at the hospital and say I was hit by a train?
I mean ...
I would imagine he was found in critical condition since from what I have heard, you're going to have problems moving immediately after getting hit by a train.

I thought he had recovered pretty well since someone said he was rolling not that long after he got out of the hospital!
Damn...

&amp;#x200B;

But it looks like he's keeping his head up and not giving up which is really important.
&amp;#x200B;

Wish him the best.
Leave this thread, please.

Hey there Detective Sherlock.
I hate to tell ya but heres not the best place to do more investigative work.
Thanks again.

It's really sad, but on the bright side he was putting together a lot of gratitude for Dana being there for his family.
I want to believe he is just having a hard time expressing what his brain is thinking and he is still improving.
[removed]
I'd imagine he's just happy to be alive, no matter how fucked up his body/speech is.
I can only imagine how much you appreciate living after going through such a near-death experience.

Unfortunately, statistically, almost all improvement you see regarding brain damage happens in the first 12 months after the incident :/
Well that sucks to learn...
Matt is a statistical outlier in many many ways.
Had to be several minutes, he ended up comatose for a week or so, doctors were preparing to get the family options for palliative care until he passes but he ended up waking from the coma.

His body looks like its in pretty great shape too, all things considered.
Good for him.

If memory serves he was airlifted from the scene to the hospital.
Canâ€™t remember where I heard that from, Pat Militich maybe?
But basically no, he did not just show up lol.
I luh you Reddit.

Ahh Jesus Iâ€™m in tears... this guy cannot be for real ðŸ˜‚ 
Imagine rolling into ED to let them know youâ€™ve just been skittled by a fkn train.
I hit a very solid, mature, tree at 80 miles and afterwards the lag between thinking something in my head and being able to vocally express it was surreal.
Was like playing counterstrike on 250,000 ping.
Amen.

Me too..
It's heartbreaking to see his gait and hear him speak but he beat the odds by even surviving.
He's gonna cherish the rest of his life like only few do..

the shithead in this thread who is spamming comments about how 'crappy' of a person he was isn't entirely wrong regarding what his autobiography said about him (BUT is in the complete wrong for being a fucking twat here).
Some of the stuff he said he did in that book was awful and I had to separate my admiration for him as a fighter from his personality after reading it at the time.
Everyone deserves redemption and compassion.
He's not that person anymore no matter how you look at it.

If it helps those that hold hate - that guy died in a train wreck.
This new one seems different and genuinely thankful just to be alive and that his family was looked after.
Well said.

Wish people would stop repeating this.
He wasn't brain dead.
Brain death is by definition irreversible.
[Incorrect.
](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem_death)

Matt Hughes went into deep coma and was hooked up to a respirator and other assistant machines.
Braindead is just the common way of saying brainstem death.
It was and is a true surprise that he woke from his coma.
The fact he can walk and talk is a subject of ongoing scientific study.
Dr. Doesnâ€™t know what the fuck heâ€™s talking about over heeere.
Indeed.
Very sad to see.
I had no idea it impacted his cognitive abilities.
That was rather heartbreaking to see and my love to him and his family.
man...same boat.
heartbreaking.
What did he say in the book?
I was not into the UFC back then.
I had no idea this had even happened!
It's so sad to see him like this.
I think his mind is probably still right, maybe a little slowed but it just seems he's lost a lot of his motor function control, seems he received damage to his frontal lobe?
Not really sure.
How does someone go about getting hit by a train on accident?
I'm curious to know if they figured out what happen exactly.
He was in his truck and it got struck by a train?
Was the truck stuck and he couldn't get out in time?
Fucking sucks seeing anyone dealing with this type of shit.

AFAIK he was driving on a country road and most likely thought he could beat the train but couldn't.
Apparently he tried to beat a train but lost traction on a rocky road.
I had a friend who was hit by a train in high school.
(Survivedâ€” was in a car, not on foot.)
Not all railroad crossings are as obvious or clearly marked as they need to be.
Couple that with loud music, and it can happen.
Happens where I grew up with some regularity, believe it or not.
Most likely trying to beat the train but it could have been one of those train crossings that only use lights and he just didnâ€™t see it.
ray bloody purchase.
There were A LOT of speculation in terms of suicide.
That couple with he fact that in reality matt hughes is considered a terrible person.
Well i wont speculate but idk.
IT is fishy.
Non gated country railroad crossings with questionable visibility combined with sleep deprivation, distraction, ect.
I live very close to Matt's area out in the country areas where he was a lot of tracks dont have crossing arms and dipshit kids will break the lights and it's easy to just have tunnel vision drive right onto the tracks when theres no flashing lights or arms to stop you.
Pat M said it was a crossing Matt used all the time, And if you get stuck there your waiting for a while, He risked it and went, Smash... pretty sure this was said on a JRE.
