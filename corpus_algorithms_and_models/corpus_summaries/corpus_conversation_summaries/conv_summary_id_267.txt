Original Response: 
On a bit of a hiatus from work and I was wondering if there are any bars in Corpus, Port A, or the island that have a good turnout of young people during the week.
It depends what kind of places you're into.
During the week, Politics on South Staples and Yorktown is usually pretty chill, but their drinks are a bit overpriced.
I used to enjoy going to Outta Bounds, but it has become more of a sports bar/college hangout than it ever was, so it gets pretty packed.
Not really my thing.There's also a place downtown called Vernon's that isn't too bad.
Real small, out of the way, not the worst place.
Also, Gator's gets pretty busy as well, but some of the live bands that play are humorous.
One of the best beer selections I've seen so far has been at Jack Ash's.
The guy who orders the beer knows his stuff and likes awesome beer.
But, like Outta Bounds, it gets pretty busy, and the crowd isn't really my cup of tea.
Pity, because they do have some wonderful beers.
Clicks was my favorite for a long time.
Give them a shot.

The bartenders at Outta Bounds are pretty cool, too.
They also have live bands play on occasion.
