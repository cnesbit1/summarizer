Original Response: 
I'm not sure how his attorney can live with herself.
"Here we have this latino woman with fake boobs coming on to him".
She was in a fucking hospital bed unwell and immobilized by drugs FFS.
I guess she was asking for it.
Edit: this preditor should go away for a long time.
On a big pile of money is how.
Everyone deserves a fair trial, the attorney doesn’t have to like the person she’s defending.
Most defense attorneys spend their lives defending criminals.
I work in recruitment for the medical field, Doctors can literally get away with murder.
That doesn't mean he should try to pass off a rapist as an innocent person.
Being a good lawyer doesn't mean trying to make a guilty person go free.
What do you mean?
The attorney was hired to defend him, did so, got paid.
That’s how it works, defense lawyers defend criminals.
This doesn’t mean she condones what he did, she was doing her JOB.
Like, are you living in a universe where lawyers who defend killers agree and say “yeah, that’s okay”?
Was this guy not supposed to hire a lawyer?
Then he’d be assigned one.
The only other option would be self representation, which is most always a terrible idea.
But if he didn’t have a lawyer, the it wouldn’t have been a fair trial.
This is not to say I condone what this guy did.
It was awful and it should have gotten a higher sentence.
But you can’t blame or hate on the lawyer for doing her job well.
A defendant is innocent until proven guilty, she is trying to defend a presumably innocent man because that is her job.
Regardless of how terrible a person is, she must defend him to the best of her ability to ensure a fair trial.
Uh.. yes it does.
The lawyer's job is to defend their client.
It doesn't mean they agree with their clients actions, it means they are doing their damn job.
It's not a hard thing to understand.
That’s for the judge or jury to decide.

While I agree that the lawyer's victim blaming is disgusting, our justice system only works if defense attorneys are willing to do whatever they can to defend their clients.
The problems here are the scumbag criminal and the very lenient verdict.
Well, but a lawyer doesn't necessarily know who is guilty or not.
And, if anything the legal system is at fault if it allows smart lawyers to wriggle their way around the law.
But she's not trying to present a fair case.
She's choosing her words carefully to paint the woman as an intentional seducer -- "fake boobs" is the new "what was she wearing?"
I guess -- and the guy as helpless in the face of her aggressive come-ons.
If the case was ruled solely on the facts he'd be in jail.
Editing to add: Yes, I know a lawyer's job is to make the best case for their client.
But I don't think that should mean lawyers should immediately pander to bigotry and bias to sway a jury.
That is not fact-based.
That's slander.
Yes I know exactly how it works.
Read what I wrote.
The point is that's a bullshit victim blaming defense and she didn't have to take the case.
"Defending someone as well as possible" vs twisting the truth intentionally.
This is a system where if you have enough money you can get a great, unscrupulous lawyer to do a character assassination of your victim.
It's not about his right to a lawyer.
It's about what kind of mud they are willing to sling for profit.
You shamed the attorney, quoted what she said as a defense, then summarized how and why the victim was a victim.
Soooo... I’m gonna say, no, based on your initial comment, you don’t know how it works.
That presumption is supposed to apply to jurors and the state, not your personal lawyer.
A lot of them learn from their clients that they are guilty while preparing for trial, but they have to make the defense that their client demands.
It also doesn’t mean she should vilify a victim.
What does her ethnicity or her cosmetic surgery have to do with anything?
Nothing.
It was used to paint in her a certain light in front of a jury: that she is a Mexican slut who basically was asking for it.
Yes, I know I answered my own question.
It was rhetorical.
"They're just doing their job" is the flimsiest goddamn excuse for anything I've ever heard.
"But I was told to by a person who gave me money".
Justice...served or something.
Not doing your job is how you get disbarred and lose your job.
That part really got to me.
It's so gross that that is the description the attorney went for.
&gt;Being a good lawyer doesn't mean trying to make a guilty person go free.
She was the defense lawyer.
Yes, it fucking does, lol.
&gt;What does her ethnicity or her cosmetic surgery have to do with anything?
&gt;It was used to paint in her a certain light in front of a jury:

You answered your own question.
If your lawyer isn't willing to 'twist the truth intentionally' then they aren't going to be 'Defending someone as well as possible'.
It's absolutely fucking disgusting, but this is the reality of our justice system.
"Everyone deserves a fair trial" should work for both sides.
It isn't "fair" on either side for the attorney to resort to victim blaming as the chosen strategy.
If she didnt want to get raped, she just shouldn't have had boobs!

I hate the way hospitals practically suck the doctors’ dicks.
Doctors get away with the worst bedside manner, massive and life threatening errors, and at the same time get a lounge full of free food and hospital swag.
Guess what nurses get?
Fired for the smallest discrepancies or patient complaint, and have to pay for parking.
I was about to comment with that line:

“Here we have this Latina woman with her fake boobs that came onto that little nerdy middle-aged guy, and he lost his mind.” 

So the rapist is the poor victim and the half unconscious rape victim hitting an unplugged nurse button frantically for help is just some bimbo.
Nice touch of racism there too.
Seriously this attorney can got to hell.
You can defend your client without crafting some racist slut shaming narrative.
[removed]
Victim shaming works.
Until it stops working, attorneys are going to keep using it, because if it gives their client a better chance, they would be potentially violating their own duties to their client if they don’t.
Which is why we need to change the underlying culture.
So that no one believes victim shaming- and it stops working.
[removed]
Welcome to America.
I hope you're enjoying your stay.
It's her job to give her client the best possible defense.
This includes using every dirty trick the law allows.
If she doesn't, she could be disbarred.
Or worse, if he got 20 years, he could appeal on the grounds of poor representation and go completely free.
I agree.
The lawyer is slimy even if she was just doing her job.
Good employee.
Shady person.
Yeah, but a defense attorney wouldn’t say, for example, the victim was black so the crime isn’t so bad, or it was a Tuesday, so it wasn’t really theft.
There are certain defenses that are outside the realm of acceptability or plausibility.

Being a defense attorney doesn't mean you have to lie and twist reality though.
Present a fair case so the judge and juries can decide.
It seems like you don't how know it works if you think it's fine to just lie.
This thread here is pissing me off.
Hate the rapist.
Not the lawyer.
His lawyer is doing *exactly* what she promised to do when she went to school and took the bar.
Defend her clients to the best of her ability, and make sure the jury convicts or doesn’t BEYOND a shadow of a doubt.
Rapist is bad.
Lawyer is not.
[removed]
You already said it, to paint her as some Mexican slut and it worked.
It's not her job to present a fair case, it's her job to present things as favourably to him as possible.
And it's the prosecution's job to counter that, to create a fair outcome.
Her job isn't to present a fair case, it's to present the best possible defense for her client.
I don't think the legal system was designed with such willfully dishonest people in mind.
If that’s the case then it’s really a poor defence from the attorney.
[removed]
Also, pointing out her race, making a strong implication about latinas.
Another issue potentially is if the lawyer didn't defend him to the best of their ability, the doctor could sue and they could potentially lose their license as well.
It's a shit sandwich for lawyers defending these people.
Everyone deserves a fair trial though.
[removed]
That is untrue.
I'm a lawyer.
It is a serious violation of professional ethics to present an argument that you know is untrue.
If the client insists on making a false argument, you have to withdraw from the case.
Most defense lawyers will explain this to the client at the outset so the client does not confess to them.
But if the client does, they cannot take an opposite position from the known facts.
[removed]
[removed]
Yeah the point of the attorney is to get the client as light of a sentence, or the best outcome possible.
Sounds like you don't understand how the court system works.
The Jury is the one who decides the sentence in the end in Texas apparently according to the article, and so it's in their best interest to paint their defendant in the best light possible, and the prosecution in the worst light possible.
How are the facts that she is Latino or had breast implants in any way relevant to a rape?
This is outrageous.
The question is how the attorney can live with herself, not whether she's good at her job or not.
"I was just doing my job" does not excuse everything.
Wrong.
A defence lawyer has a duty to present a defence.
They don't have a duty to slander the victim by implication and they certainly don't have a duty to use racial epithets as part of that defence.
This is *exactly* the sort of behaviour that results in the enormous problems that pervade sexual assault trials in both your country and mine.
She's Latino: so what?
She has had a breast enlargement: so what?
It's outright victim blaming.
The poor nerdy doctor guy just couldn't help himself from drugging a woman, disconnecting her only means of calling for help, and raping her in her hospital bed, because she's a pretty Latina girl who has big boobs.
Read that again ffs.
It's disgraceful.
Utterly, utterly disgraceful.
And yes I am a lawyer, though a solicitor in England so I don't argue in court.
But if we employed a barrister who then went to court and said that shit I'd be ashamed of both them and myself.
Absolutely disgusting.
There's no defence for it.
[removed]
In anything other than the legal system, sure, ok.
But the day you get falsely accused of something and need that lawyer, you may disagree.
[removed]
Huh, TIL.
Would you be disbarred?
How frequently are you pretty sure they did it?
Doing your job well doesn’t excuse atrocities, we decided that with the Nazi officers who tried to pull that line after committing genocide.
And yes, perpetuating the BS “she was asking for it cause she has large breasts” line in a court of law and cementing it as a viable defense by being somewhat successful is an atrocity.
In a moral society we are allowed to say that what a person did is wrong even if it was legal and just them doing their job.
I don’t think anyone is arguing that he shouldn’t have had a lawyer or that his lawyer should defend him.
What we are saying is that the line of reasoning she used in defending should be off limits.
It’s tantamount to a defense lawyer trying to argue against a murder charge by saying “Well the victim was black and my client is a racist so he just couldn’t help himself and wasn’t the victim kinda asking for it by walking around all black like.” No one in their right mind would allow that and yet judges and juries allow the same thought process daily in rape charges and partial blame for that rests squarely on this defense lawyers shoulders.
What you are arguing is essentially the Nuremberg Defence: "I was just doing my job / I was just following orders".
We do expect people to have ethical principles that transcend their work, whether they are lawyers or soldiers.
[removed]
[removed]
It's more that that kind of defense (attempting to play on racism etc) shouldn't be allowed in court as a defense.
Her "fake boobs" and being "Latina" is not relevant and should not be allowed, even in closing arguments.
&gt; A lot of them learn from their clients that they are guilty while preparing for trial, but they have to make the defense that their client demands.
You don't have to defend a client if you know they are lying, and more importantly, if you know they are lying and push that lie, you're in danger of losing your ability to practice law.
People might not like it, but by providing a scumbag like this with the best possible defense, it also ensures that he can't get off on an appeal when he loses.
If the lawyer treated him like the rapist he is and didn't give his defense her full effort, he could just turn around later and say he never got a fair trial.
[removed]
[removed]
It's kinda ridiculous we have a system of law where attempts at manipulation are allowed especially in cases like this where it is so blatant.
She's using misogyny and racism to her clients favor.
It's disappointing.
All that being said...  if it is what is needed to be the best of the best in her field then...
I dunno all I'm saying is it's understandable how her actions could be seen as a neccessary evil.
I don't agree with it but I don't think it makes her an awful person.
[removed]
So the better job she does, the less of a chance he can appeal and claim he did not get his fair trial.
It is on the prosecutor to do their job correctly.
You'd think, with the evidence at hand that would not be difficult.
You'd think simply raping a patient who is not medically capable of giving consent would be enough.
Apparently though....

This whole thing is horrifying to me.
I don't understand why he even (in an already horribly disgusting closing argument) needed to mention that she was latina.
I just can't see any reason he said it other than to try to suggest some sort of sexual pre-disposition that she demonstrates or that she is somehow less deserving of sympathy.
Either way, it is awful.
Attorneys are basically just mouthpieces for their client.
They’re simply there to navigate the law, not make moral judgment.
[removed]
Bingo.
This is how the system works.
Couple that with wealthy individuals being able to hire better and more experienced lawyers, and you get an idea of why the legal system is often skewed to favor those who have the means.
Yes, now ask yourself what kind of jury falls for that.
Sure, but you can *absolutely* hate on her for making racist statements.
Just because she’s doing it as part of her job doesn’t make it okay.
I am an attorney.
I don't do criminal law, but I am a trial lawyer.
Our job is not to present a fair case.
Our job is to represent our client in the best way possible within the confines of the law.
The other side's job is to present their case the best way they can.
Then it is up to the fact finder, i.e.
the judge or jury, to figure out what the truth is.
This is how our judicial system has always worked.
Lawyers are not judges, we're advocates.
What's acceptable or believable is up to the judge or jury.

Seems to have worked out pretty well for her client though.

Ah yes, the old just doing my job excuse.
She was just doing what she is allowed to as are we by calling her scum who deserves to be publicly shamed for using racism and victim blaming.
A poor defense that seemed to have worked.
She apparently knew her audience.
I’m not defending this, I think it’s abhorrent how low this legal system has people crawl for “best outcomes”.
This exactly.
Although... trying to paint a sedated woman as a seducer?
Uhh... maybe the defense could've been done better.

Stop saying that.
A lawyer is meant to protect your rights not make up lies so your crimes go unpunished.
This idea lawyers try to push that they are morally pure whatever they do is bullshit.
No one is asking her to present a fair case or not defend him.
All we are saying is that certain lines of defense are “outside the realm of acceptability or plausibility.” That is not an unreasonable or unheard of stance.
Defense lawyers are not allowed to just say anything they want to try to get their client off and this should be one of the things they can’t say.
Honestly it’s just as much on the judge, who should have stopped the lawyer right there, stricken it from the record, and instructed the jury to disregard.
If a defense attorney is not allowed to ask a leading question or speculate wildly on what happened (they’re not) they shouldn’t be allowed to call the victim a slut who deserved it because she had boobs and was Latina.
Certain lines of defense are not just unsavory but are actually antithetical to justice as a whole and are therefore off limits in a court of law.
Just because we are such a shitty society that we haven’t made this one of them does not mean we can’t call the lawyer unethical for using it.
[removed]
The point is that you can do your job and defend your client *without* resorting to painting someone else in a racist, sexist light.
The fact that she has fake breasts or is latina is irrelavent, and if nothing else, leads to a jury that is not deciding a case based on the presented evidence but rather on bigotry.
[removed]
The system is intentionally adversarial.
A defense attorney is supposed to zealously advocate for their client by design.
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
Oh, yes.
Got to get that in there, because everyone KNOWS what Latinas are like...
I mean, we could just make it against the rules of procedure.
The judge could give the jury direction about what consent means and what is relevant.
[removed]
Is it a fair outcome if the jury is being encouraged to vote based on their own biases?
If one lawyer isn't as good at flaming the flames of bigotry as the other their client just won't get any justice that day?
There's a reason lawyers are, as a class, despised.
[removed]
Or, you know, since changing culture takes a long ass time, maybe we can put restrictions on the kind of things attorneys can say, hm?

But it *can* be a damn hard thing to reconcile with one’s personal sense of decency.

I commented similarly above.
In the U.S. you are entitled to an attorney/public defender.
The real travesty of this case is that this type of defense is still effective with juries.
I think that’s what OP who made the post is getting at- it’s pretty fucked that we’re still apparently working towards this end.
Its vile behavior dude.
Defense attorney does everything they can (legally) that is in the best interest of their client.
Apparently what they did was legal here.

But there aren't defenses outside the realm of "acceptability" if by that you mean social acceptability, because that's not how the legal system works.
A defense attorney has to defend his client to the best of his ability- and that includes using a defense a common person wouldn't find socially acceptable if it would work.
Defense attorneys say ALL THE TIME that a victim was black so the crime wasn't so bad.
Seriously.
They don't word it exactly like that, but they damn well do it and we've seen it 100 times with police officers over the last couple of years.
And it works.
Which is why they use it.
People often blame defense lawyers, but we've set up a system where they have to do this shit, and then we blame them for the system.
The truth is that the system is flawed.

I’ve been listening to the Dr. Death podcast and it’s making me really hope I never need surgery again.
The fact that hospitals will avoid reporting a bad doctor because it could put them at risk of lawsuits... nightmare fuel.
&gt;defense lawyers defend criminals.
Defense lawyers defend *the accused*.
Having a defense lawyer does not automatically make someone a criminal.
Innocent until proven guilty.
We shouldn't just get used to horrible things about America.
Being outraged about awful shit is the natural and right response.
Remember, court is not a system designed to find truth.
Court is a system designed to find who is better at arguing their case.
It's easier when the truth is on your side, but that doesn't negate the thousands who have been wrongly committed and the thousands who have gotten off despite doing the crime.
Using that """"argument"""" is despicable.
Not the fact that she's doing her job.
[removed]
[removed]
I mean if the judge apparently doesn't have a problem with it and you know it's going to work in your favor with the jury, why wouldn't you use every method available.

It's not slanderous to describe a Latina person as Latina.

Prosecutors won't be petty and bend the rules as well.
The only way the legal system works is if both sides do everything in their power to win.
If she admits her client is a POS then she has just lost any potential client.
It's debate, not ethics.
[removed]
Oh hey, thank you for wording what I was thinking but could not myself.
Her race, her chest size, any possible previous contact none of it is relevant in this case or any other.
Are you capable of giving consent and did you give it should be the only factor.
Your ethnicity actual or perceived, your religion, sexual history appearance including clothing are just so irrelevant.
&gt; Would you be disbarred?
You would be subject to appropriate sanctions from the governing body in your jurisdiction.
That could include disbarment, censure, or anything else.
It's circumstance specific.
&gt; How frequently are you pretty sure they did it?
I read this sentence a half dozen times, but I still have no idea what it means.
So you'd rather have a system where the defense attorney decides whether or not their client is guilty and does less of a job defending them if they think so?
It is very much the job of a defense attorney to try to make your crimes go unpunished, because it is not their job to decide whether or not your crime deserves to be punished.
That is the job of the judge and the jury.
Our justice system entitles everyone to a defense and that means the defense must defend as vigorously as possible regardless of their feelings toward the client.
There are a variety of beliefs about what constitutes ethical behaviour in legal defense; the poster you are responding to believes the attorney was unethical in their defense by leveraging what they perceived to be racism and sexism within the jury rather than finding reasonable doubt within the facts.
[removed]
a defences job is to present the clients case in a way which is most likely to appeal to the lenience of the law and the sympathies of the judge/jury.
If these defences work, then blame the law, blame the jury, blame the judge, but don't bother blaming the lawyer.
It's not their job to decide what should or shouldn't be socially acceptable or not, that's up to the jury of peers, the elected judge, the democratically arrived at laws.
The lawyer should be bottom of the list of people to blame.
[removed]
Attorneys can't have personal standards?
Attorneys are allowed to slander people?
There are things a lawyer cannot do without being disbarred no matter what their client wants, they can't avoid responsibility for their words with that excuse.
[removed]
I agree with you except the part where she didnt have to take the case.
Most lawyers work for a firm and they do not get to choose what case they take.
If they refuse to accept one they are assigned they are fired.

Crimes like this probably won't be taken seriously until there are more female attorneys, judges, lawmakers and (in cases like these) jury members who are willing to take things like rape seriously.
Listen, nobody likes jury duty, but you could be the next victim who has to go on the witness stand to tell your story.
You don’t have to be female to know rape is wrong and should be taken seriously.
Yes there should be more females in the profession but that’s a separate issue.
The fact that this year has more female candidates in the history of this country gives me hope.
You shouldn’t have to be a woman to know rape is wrong, but so many males justify it and even advocate for it.
It probably would help to have more women making and enforcing laws.
Crimes like this won't be taken seriously if the guy responsible for letting him get off with a slap on the wrist has anything less than hell to pay as a consequence.
Period.
I agree it would help to have more women making and enforcing laws however, in this case the law is already on the books as rape is illegal and it is also being enforced as this scumbag is having his day in court.
True, but it’s a lot harder for women to rationalize victim blaming or make excuses for this behavior.
As in - yes, men SHOULD (and often do) see this as deplorable behavior, but women can’t not.
Especially true for younger women I think, for a variety of generational reasons.
So while we can and should fight for this to be taken seriously right now, and regardless of gender, there’s a very real light of hope from the fact that these female law professionals are coming and will be unstoppable en masse.
I was shocked to read this from his female attorney:

&gt;"Here we have this Latina woman with her fake boobs that came onto that little nerdy middle-aged guy, and he lost his mind," Andrews said during her closing argument, The Chronicle reported.
What the hell, lady?
I wonder how the wanton, unconscious hussy seduced your client into disconnecting the call button...
The good news is - there are.
More and more women are in the legal profession, and at all levels.
Women slightly outnumber men in enrollment over the last few years, say ten to fifteen.
The defense attorney in this case is a woman.
&gt;there should be more females in the profession

Why?
Who gets To decide that?
It seems logical to me to say that there should be as many women in the profession as women in the world want to be in the profession.
We don't need more women in said profession "just because they're women"
Yes, it's in the books but culturally, we aren't there yet.
And therein lies the problem.
When we have to have the #metoo movement, when judges like Aaron Persky repeatedly sides with and shows favoritism to "young men with good futures" like Brock Turner, and when women are painted as hysterical, slutty, or vengeful during rape cases, it's beyond just "the laws are in the books and it's illegal" so we should be content with it.
Sorry, I'm not trying to come off as attacking you, just trying to make a point that just because it's a law and it's being enforced doesn't mean that justice is really served.
You Mean the judge?
That's 50% more, many times more than slightly I would say.

Women make up around 50.5 to 51% of U.S. law students these days, I just didn't want to overstate the statistic.
Women still only make up about 5-10% of elected officials, so there's plenty of need for improvement.

In my life, I see just as many women justifying this behavior as I do men.
Some people just suck and nobody has a monopoly on it.
Jury.
[removed]
As per the article, in Texas, the jury decides the sentence.
I agree, too many men are getting away with this as well as too many women.
When a male doctor can rape a female patient and get probation we have a culture problem.
When female teaches can rape young men and have it referred to as "sex" as opposed to "rape" we have a culture problem.
When female teachers can rape young men and get only probation we have a culture problem.

Nothing wrong with more women making and enforcing laws, but your implication that only men justify and advocate rape is just wrong.
Women can be rapists too, and most of society thinks that that shit is hilarious.
I think our society has a problem acknowledging rape as a serious issue entirely, not just when the woman is the victim.

The thing is that there are people who will choose to not *see* it as rape.
"She obviously wanted it.
Not rape".
They believe rape is wrong but to them rape is only something that happens in a back alley.

It actually is kind of unbelievable.
I legitimately cannot understand how the jury agreed on that.
Absolutely disgusting.

They're saying he violated his marriage vow and doctor's oath.
Screw that... before *any* of these oath violations even come to play, he violated the law by engaging in criminal activity!
He raped someone!
That's like people saying "he violated his parental duty by murdering this person...he can't be a good dad anymore, now that he's engaged in murder".
NO, there's A MUCH BIGGER violation going on when someone decides to murder, you don't get to downplay the egregiousness of the crime.

Summary: 
She was the defense lawyer.
It's not about his right to a lawyer.
The lawyer's job is to defend their client.
I know and his lawyer is a woman too.
Defense lawyers defend *the accused*.
The defense attorney in this case is a woman.
Lawyers are not judges, we're advocates.
That is the job of the judge and the jury.
This is how the system works.
"I was just doing my job" does not excuse everything.
That’s how it works, defense lawyers defend criminals.
I guess she was asking for it.
It's her job to give her client the best possible defense.
Yes I know exactly how it works.
The lawyer is slimy even if she was just doing her job.
I don't do criminal law, but I am a trial lawyer.
It's a shit sandwich for lawyers defending these people.
Our job is not to present a fair case.
Present a fair case so the judge and juries can decide.
This is not to say I condone what this guy did.
Not the fact that she's doing her job.
It is on the prosecutor to do their job correctly.
That’s for the judge or jury to decide.
Attorneys are basically just mouthpieces for their client.
Attorneys are allowed to slander people?
A poor defense that seemed to have worked.
Defense attorney does everything they can (legally) that is in the best interest of their client.
The other side's job is to present their case the best way they can.
I mean, we could just make it against the rules of procedure.
Editing to add: Yes, I know a lawyer's job is to make the best case for their client.
But she's not trying to present a fair case.
But you can’t blame or hate on the lawyer for doing her job well.
This doesn’t mean she condones what he did, she was doing her JOB.
The lawyer should be bottom of the list of people to blame.
Having a defense lawyer does not automatically make someone a criminal.
The truth is that the system is flawed.
Yes, I know I answered my own question.
The attorney was hired to defend him, did so, got paid.
Well, but a lawyer doesn't necessarily know who is guilty or not.
It also doesn’t mean she should vilify a victim.
No one is asking her to present a fair case or not defend him.
The good news is - there are.
The system is intentionally adversarial.
I legitimately cannot understand how the jury agreed on that.
Got to get that in there, because everyone KNOWS what Latinas are like...
Most defense attorneys spend their lives defending criminals.
the judge or jury, to figure out what the truth is.
It's not a hard thing to understand.
Attorneys can't have personal standards?
What's acceptable or believable is up to the judge or jury.
Most lawyers work for a firm and they do not get to choose what case they take.
The thing is that there are people who will choose to not *see* it as rape.
Seems to have worked out pretty well for her client though.
It probably would help to have more women making and enforcing laws.
But if he didn’t have a lawyer, the it wouldn’t have been a fair trial.
I don’t think anyone is arguing that he shouldn’t have had a lawyer or that his lawyer should defend him.
Somebody had to take the case.
The question is how the attorney can live with herself, not whether she's good at her job or not.
I don't agree with it but I don't think it makes her an awful person.
The point is that's a bullshit victim blaming defense and she didn't have to take the case.
Her job isn't to present a fair case, it's to present the best possible defense for her client.
A defence lawyer has a duty to present a defence.
Apparently what they did was legal here.
It doesn't mean they agree with their clients actions, it means they are doing their damn job.
It seems like you don't how know it works if you think it's fine to just lie.
Sounds like you don't understand how the court system works.
Seriously this attorney can got to hell.
This is how our judicial system has always worked.
It's so gross that that is the description the attorney went for.
A defense attorney is supposed to zealously advocate for their client by design.
I agree with you except the part where she didnt have to take the case.
I'm not sure how his attorney can live with herself.
Most defense lawyers will explain this to the client at the outset so the client does not confess to them.
If she didnt want to get raped, she just shouldn't have had boobs!
There's a reason lawyers are, as a class, despised.
Not doing your job is how you get disbarred and lose your job.
"Everyone deserves a fair trial" should work for both sides.
If she doesn't, she could be disbarred.
Defense lawyers are not allowed to just say anything they want to try to get their client off and this should be one of the things they can’t say.
That's 50% more, many times more than slightly I would say.
It's not her job to present a fair case, it's her job to present things as favourably to him as possible.
While I agree that the lawyer's victim blaming is disgusting, our justice system only works if defense attorneys are willing to do whatever they can to defend their clients.
There's no defence for it.
It actually is kind of unbelievable.
