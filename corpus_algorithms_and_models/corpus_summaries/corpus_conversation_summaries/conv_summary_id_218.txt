Original Response: 
I'll be headed down tomorrow and a friend and myself want to go fishing.
I've looked into the charters and they're really expensive for private charters.
We're only looking to go for a few hours and don't mind being with others.
I seem to remember a large boat with 25+ people that would take you bay fishing that wouldn't break the bank.
I'm not wanting to spend more than $60 a person.
This has to exist, right?
Ya but you might want to expand to rockport and port A because the variety opens up.
Also it might be a bit more expensive because a lot of people here consider labor day weekend the peak Bull Red fishing so who knows they may charge a bit more.
Thanks for the info!
The price is flexible I just wanted to throw out a ball park.

Summary: 
I'm not wanting to spend more than $60 a person.
