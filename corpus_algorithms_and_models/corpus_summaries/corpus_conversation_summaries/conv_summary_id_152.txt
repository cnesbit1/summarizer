Report them to the turtle patrol if you see them beached!
361-949-8173 ext 266If you are out of nueces, call 866turtle5.We are in peak nesting season, and they are nesting in our area.
Didn't do anything but watch them swim lol.
Yeah, I didn't really figure you were going to hop in the water and attempt to surf on one, but you never know.

Wasn't meant as  a hand wavy thing.
Apologies.
