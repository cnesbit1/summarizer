Original Response: 
Welp, Peter Dutton's just survived a no confidence motion, by one vote.
Much like he survived getting referred to the High Court, by one vote.
So essentially, today's QT is going to be SUPER toxic.
In other words, it's just another Thursday in Parliament.

Again...
When is our chance to kick this mob out?
News Corp campaigned relentlessly against Gillard/Rudd in 2013 but now, after a literal civil war in the LNP, they're absolutely fucking silent.
I believe ScoMo's indicated that the next election will be around May.
But with so much BS we deserve an election now and if Labor was in power in similar circumstances, news Corp would be frothing at the mouth for one.
The public voted in a Turnbull govt but instead we have this Morrison-Dutton shitfest.
Welp, tough luck buddy, you get to vote when you're told you're allowed to vote like the rest of us plebs.
There should be a rule that forces an election if a PM or cabinet is sacked or forced to resign during an available election period.
Why?
We don't elect the PM.
The bastards we voted for are still there.
I wonder if we could create a rule where you're only allowed to change leader while you're in opposition.
Hence including the cabinet, we currently have a cabinet and PM protecting a cabinet member who has lied to parliament.
Nor is it the first time.
How many cabinet shuffles has there been during the last 5 years.
We have had ministers in portfolios for 10 or 11 months out of 5 years.
The lack of continuity cannot be good for policy and the country.
We also don't vote for the cabinet, so why should that change trigger elections?
Because it shows that the government is in turmoil.
If portfolios can handle having a minister for less than 12 months at a time, then we may as well have elections every 12 months for stable government.
Not really.
Departments do the work, not the minister.
So you would argue ministers are not required or could be changed monthly then?
Are required constitutionally, yes.
Can be changed, also yes.
Should be, no.
But my answers have no bearing on if cabinet reshuffles should trigger an election.
No one voted in the minister for x.
We voted for a rep, and we still have a rep.

Summary: 
We don't elect the PM.
The bastards we voted for are still there.
No one voted in the minister for x.
We also don't vote for the cabinet, so why should that change trigger elections?
We voted for a rep, and we still have a rep.
