Original Response: 
I am 100% sure that is a goalie interference.
Well the goal was already scored before the goalie contact was made, so maybe not?
What's the ruling on this?
He shouldn’t have had two pucks.
Bowser probably didn’t know which was the real one and which would kill him.
NO GOAL.

Show me in the rule book where it says you can only have one puck in play at a time.
I say it's a good goal!

[13.3 Illegal Puck - If at any time while play is in progress, a puck other
than the one legally in play shall appear on the playing surface, the
play shall not be stopped but shall continue with the legal puck until
the play then in progress is completed by change of possession.

Im not a ref or anything, so this was the best i could find after a quick search.
There are more rules and stuff that outline penalties for shooting an illegal puck at a puck handler of a legal puck, under "throwing equipment" rules i think, that I think shooting multiple pucks at the goalie would probably be forbidden under some combination of those rules.
If you shave off enough ice can you make a snowball and throw it at the goalie?
In the Hocket Canada rulebook a 2nd puck doesn't stop play until players start to play with it.
If it's ignored then an official should be able to scoop it up with little to no drama.
But was his foot in the crease?
Oops wrong Stars goal...

What's the ruling on this?
