Original Response: 
95%+ of my FTA intake is ABC, so yes.
Commercial FTA is unwatchable due to the sheer volume of ads, when I want to watch some series, it's Netflix time.
They are the only network that consistently does subtitles.
Watch.
A movie on FTA and its full of ads.
The same movie is on netflix with no ads.
what is FTA?
&gt;Commercial FTA is unwatchable due to the sheer volume of ads,

Commercial FTA is also unwatchable due to the mostly rubbish programs it features.
Free to Air.
thanks...I was thinking 'Football Time Arvos' or something lol.
The block.
Bachelor.
Married at first sight.
All the morning shows.
Shit house.
It's now a bit of a game with me to time and count ads.
I was watching a doco the other day and it was 50% program and 50% ads.
5 minutes of program followed by 5 minutes of ads.
And my top count (so far) is 17 in a row - I can remember way back when it was a maximum of 4 ads per segment.
And notice how a ~~one~~ half-hour program now takes at least 35 minutes if not 40 minutes.
A 1 hour show actually being around 40 minutes give or take isn't something new.
It's been like that forever now.
Speaking of which how cool is this

Hey.
Hey.
Remember that huge "Channel 10 Pilot Week"?
Yeah.
What the fuck happened to that?
My mistake.
Oops.
Sorry.
That should read "And notice how a half-hour program now takes at least 35 minutes if not 40 minutes."
Edited.
Thanks.
Didn't see a single minute of it.
This is amazing.
