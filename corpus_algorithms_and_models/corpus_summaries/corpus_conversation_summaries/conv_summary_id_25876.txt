Those eyes...She could ruin my life and I would still say thank you.
It’s a shame she’s always covered up by so much makeup on that show cause she’s beautiful.
She's still super cute on the show though.
Alara, can you open this jar of pickles?
They need to find an excuse to put her in a swimsuit on Orville.
We need a resort planet episode.
A hot springs episode like some anime shows?
I would be okay with that.
In Star Trek, they often have R&amp;R on the "pleasure planet" Risa, where everyone relaxes on the beach and bangs each other.
http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/RisaWe need an episode of Orville where they go to their version of Risa, get the characters in swimsuits like [this](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/36/7e/5b/367e5b8f2f70ba5559baf84561a89bc4.jpg) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/yevjGjr.jpg).

Summary: 
I would be okay with that.
