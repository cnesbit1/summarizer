Im just searching for ways to improve this experience.
Women have lots of small things and tricks while all I can find about male masturbation is:

- multiple orgasm technique

- long, well written, always the same copy pasta about some tricks.
Do you have anything else guys?
Or are we just blocks on concrete in this way?
In my experience there are no multiple orgasms, the best is to edge then you’ll have a pretty strong one, and also, use a condom and a comforter instead of using your hand.
How exactly do you use those items together?

You get a hard on, you put on the condom and put your dick in the folds of your comforter, us your hands to keep the form and rock back and forth until you cum.
Does this actually work?
Yes, at least for me it does and there is nor risk of deathgrip or whatever.
How do you maintain pressure on your dick?
Like do you grip the comforter around it?
Also, does it just smoothly slide between the comforter or do you need to lube it up?
You hold the comforter around it grabbing as much as you can so you’re keeping it tight but with the least amount of pressure.
I don’t use lube, condoms are expensive as it is.
Awesome, just need to buy condoms to make this happen.
Any other cool methods u reccomend?
You can hump a pillow doggy style .... lol, this sounds very strange when I put it into words.
Hahah very true!
When i try this i get chafing, how do you solve this?
