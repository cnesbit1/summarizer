Original Response: 
&gt; One figure suggested at least 30 of the 90 members....but speculated the actual result could have been as high as 36.
**EDIT:** According to Fairfax, the result was Abbott 46 - 38 Empty Chair.
So they'd only need to swing 10 votes to depose him lmao.
They should circulate a petition and force another vote in 3 days.
Yup.
Abbott doesn't have any post election gigs lined up so he's not going to go away easily.
They need to strike now otherwise they're stuck with this onion until beyond 2021.

He'd be OK.
He could always go back to journalism.
Papa Murdoch would look after him.
Contrary to prevailing opinion (much like the man himself) Abbott was never a journo, he was an opinion writer.
It's a pity no one else ran.
They might have been able to garner the 10 votes.
I hoped using the words 'journalism' and 'Murdoch' in the same paragraph might have implied that.
Fair enough, I'll pay that :)
Sky news needs a new talking head.
&gt; Yup.

He isn't in it for the money.
[The pension he'll get when he finally retires is considerably larger than his current backbencher's salary](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/liberal-leadership-spill-tony-abbotts-annual-pension-to-top-300000-plus-extras-20150914-gjmigj.html).
Imagine an Abbott/Latham show.
There would be so much sound distortion from the volume that shops selling speakers would do well from it.
A talking dick...
He'd be in it for a nationwide personal platform to rail at everyone who didn't think he was the second coming.
Vote 1, Empty Chair.

Summary: 
He could always go back to journalism.
Papa Murdoch would look after him.
They might have been able to garner the 10 votes.
