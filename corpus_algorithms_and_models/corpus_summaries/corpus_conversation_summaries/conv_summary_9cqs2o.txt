Unlike most of these posts this is happening as I write this.
Bit of background, I have been on medication for almost a month now for mental health issues and one of the side effects is insomnia.
So I have had trouble sleeping and I am in high school so it takes a large toll on me.
I woke up this morning after 4 hours of sleep, and I have a maths test today and I am struggling to stay awake as is.
So on my walk to school I figured I would stop by Woolies and buy an energy drink.
Walked in, saw that they were on special so my dumb arse bought 4.
Almost at school now and I have downed 3 of them and I down another one om my way in.
(Now I usually have these but not in such a large dosage).
I get in to class and my teacher doesnt mind me having a can in class so I drink away.
About half an hour into class and I can't sit still.
My legs and hands are shaking uncontrollably and my heart is racing.
I panic a bit and don't really know what to do so I just sit there and take the test.
Fast forward 30 minutes and I am sitting on the toilet writing this, with 2L of V Energy in my gut.
Even better thing is that I looked at the can and worked out how much caffeine I had consumed... 620mG of caffeine in under 2 hours.
So I am just gonna pray I don't have a heart attack or something.
At least I won't fall asleep in class though haha.
TL;DR: Had hardly any sleep.
Bought energy drinks to stay awake during a test.
Had 2 Liters of V Energy and now I am shaking like a leaf.
Will update at the end of the day to see how I go.
EDIT: I survived the day.
Started coming down from all that caffeine after about 4 hours.
I felt so shitty and just wanted to sleep it off.
My resting heart rate was 160Bpm and I felt really sick.
Lost my appetite too.
But hey I stayed awake during my test so mission accomplished.
:)
Did you survive?
No, I died.
