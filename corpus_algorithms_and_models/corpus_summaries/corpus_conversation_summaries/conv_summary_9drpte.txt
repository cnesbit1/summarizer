ITT People not realising that if you want things to change, then you have to change the opinions of the the apolitical or political-neutral.
As it is, many middleground Singaporeans couldn’t care less what happens behind closed doors, but they wouldn’t be caught openly supporting the LGBT movement either.
And this is also the exact same mentality the govt has adopted as well, because it isn’t worth risking the lashback from their conservative/religious base.
It sucks, but nothing is gonna change until the baby boomers move on.
Don't forget the younger people who share the values of the conservative section of the baby boomers.
And the baby boomers whose values are like the super left wing liberal intelligentsia.
But I see your point :)

I have to wonder about the young Trump supporters, though...
Well i kind of see them as outliers, in this day and age, the younger generations are so engaged in social media that it is hard to stay ignorant.
I find it hard to believe that India is somehow more liberal than Singapore.
If it can happen there, I'm not sure how tenable Singapore's excuse is.
Notably, we have one of the most liberal abortion laws in the world.
This contrast is so puzzling.
There's still something called confirmation bias, and it affects some people more severely than others.
There are still a lot of people who would remain ignorant with or without the internet.
I would argue that the government's stance on 377A (and other things like media regulations) are hampering debate and the natural evolution of opinions though.
If you look at the US, for instance, support for marriage equality increased from only 44% in 2010 to 60% in 2015.
That's from a minority to a majority in five years.
This is often attributed to people seeing more LGBT people depicted in the media, increased awareness of the issues that LGBT people face, and so on.
If people only ever hear negative things about LGBT people, or are ignorant about what being LGBT is or the problems they face, they're not gonna be convinced by one person trying to change their mind.
The cultures and religions in Singapore are less accepting of homosexuality than that of those in India.
We also have even more conservative religious neighbours that have significant ties to us.
Legalizing homosexuality might cause more tension within society and between our neighbours and that kind of harm might not be worth removing a law that isn't enforced anyway.
This is important.
The debate isn't happening on an even field right now.
Pro-LGBT views are basically only allowed on the internet and once a year during Pink Dot.
Meanwhile the National Council of Churches in Singapore can remind people that buttsex is a sin every few weeks and release an official handbook about how great conversion therapy is with no real censure or pushback.
I'm not so sure what Muis is up too but I'm sure it's basically the same thing.
MediaCorp can't air "pro-homosexuality" content.
Mass Effect almost got banned here because got the gay romance questlines.
Attempts to normalise homosexuality in sexuality education classes by vendors in schools get slapped down with the fury of a thousand middle aged mothers.
How to work like that?
The % of Muslims is similar in both countries.
The only *significant* difference is that Singapore has a much higher % of Christians and Catholics.
So just to clarify - people from those two groups are bigots that preventing social progress.
Let's call a spade a spade.
&gt;might not be worth removing a law that isn't enforced anyway.
So this law is simultaneously meaningless while also being of such importance to cause harm?
You can't really have it both ways.
Social media doesn't do anything here, and as much as it spreads messages supporting one side, the other side has equal opportunity to make use of such a medium.
The views and values of an individual on the issue doesn't change because of that.
It depends on how important they view love and the concept of marriage.
There's still a long way to go between feeling neutral and fully accepting the issue of gay sex, and even among the younger generations, many are still closer to feeling neutral on the issue, which is why there's very little incentive for the government to implement such a change.

Let's call a spade a spade.
Using your reasoning, the higher % of Christians and Catholics are also responsible for reducing the prevalence of sex crimes.
If you use that line of thinking it cuts both ways.
Correlation=/=Causation.
Churches have strong anti-homosexual views and are one of the largest sources of organised opposition to pro-lgbt legislation/activities.
And on the other hand the prevalence of sex crimes in India is obviously not due to the lack of christian faith there.
&gt;Using your reasoning, the higher % of Christians and Catholics are also responsible for reducing the prevalence of sex crimes.
If you use that line of thinking it cuts both ways.
Do Christians and Catholics speak out against sex crimes more than any other group in Singapore?
Meanwhile, we know for a fact that those two religions are vehemently opposed to homosexuality.
Please just look at things like the AWARE saga, NLB book fiasco or the Wear White campaign.
So yeah, your argument makes no sense, because there's correlation for one issue while none for the other.
Your thinking is too simplistic.
Just because people don't vehemently speak out against homosexuality does not mean that they support LGBT.
The method by which you "determined" correlation is laughably dumb.
Saudi Arabia has no Catholics and Christians, why don't they have gay marriage as well?
But its okay.
You can continue labouring under the delusion that all that stands in the way of gay marriage are Christians and Catholics.

Are you being daft by denying that Christians and Catholics (as a whole) in Singapore aren't relatively more opposed to homosexuality compared to atheists or those of non-Abrahamic faith?
Hint: polls actually show that to be the case.
With that in mind, if Singapore has more people opposed to LGBT rights, are you really denying the positive correlation between that and the fact that we have a much higher % of Christians and Catholics in this country?
You are backtracking.
Someone posted [a bunch of reasons why Singapore as a whole may be opposed to LGBT outside of religion](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9drpte/singapore_society_has_to_decide_which_direction/e5kdi9q/) and your response was this:

Go ahead and try to shift the goal posts into "whether Christians and Catholics are opposed to LGBT".
I'm done here.

Ceddya's point is that there is a much higher % of Christians in Singapore, while the % of Muslims in Singapore and India are similar.
Saudi Arabia on the other hand is practically the center of Islam, so it's not an apples-to-apples comparison.
I fully understand ceddya's point.
I just think he's misguided in believing that with regards to LGBT issues Singapore is "India except with a higher % of Christians".
Even worse, the person he responded to already highlighted the myriad of different factors that make Singapore and India markedly different (to add, factors that may justify the government's stance).
I won't be continuing this discussion any further, but thanks for taking a civil tone.
India has severe problems with enforcing it's mandate and doing anything in general.
That's what happened when the British put so many nations together and called it "India".
As such, even if Delhi says that homosexuality is repealed, other areas might not feel as compelled to comply, especially if they don't speak the language or share the religion.
There's not much accountability to force the change so the homophobes might not fear it as much.
It also helps that historically, Indian culture doesn't hate homosexuality.
Singapore is different.
If 337A is repealed it means its repealed.
Our conservative Muslim neighbours will not take kindly to that, and the conservative religious in this country will definitely feel attacked.
This is not the kind of hornets nest that the government will want to kick up and they rather keep the status quo of not doing anything with the law there.
&gt;So this law is simultaneously meaningless while also being of such importance to cause harm?
You can't really have it both ways.
It's functionally meaningless but it means something to a huge majority of people in the region if it's removed.
Currently, nobody is being prosecuted by the act.
It is an uneasy compromise that we should make as we slowly push for more acceptance of LGBT issues.

TLDR - Singapore has to pander to bigots?
&gt;It is an uneasy compromise that we should make as we slowly push for more acceptance of LGBT issues.
Just fyi, it's not really compromise if only one side is making all the concessions.
Yes.
You don't live in a society where they don't exist or where they can be easily put as a fringe group.
It's nice to see the turnout of pinkdot every year but it's still not a large enough critical mass.
It would take a generation of what you call bigots to die off before you can effect real change.
Even the Western countries, which are more liberal than us, took decades to change their mindsets to effect legislature, and yet it's still contentious.
Oh, I'll well aware of the reality of things.
I feel sorry for those who are not able to move overseas, although it's quite a sad state of affairs that people even have to move to a different country in order to be treated fairly.
Still, I'm simply calling out all the excuses people make.
When we discuss this majority, let's not sidestep how it's one comprising of *actual* bigots.
I also don't see why we should ignore the reality that the platform opposed to LGBT rights is one that has absolutely **zero** factual basis.
Finally, let us stop sugar coating it and pretending that there's any form of compromise when it's simply one side using its numbers to bully and mistreat a minority group.
This is the actual shameful state of affairs, and I'm more than glad that Singapore gets called out on it.

Summary: 
The only *significant* difference is that Singapore has a much higher % of Christians and Catholics.
