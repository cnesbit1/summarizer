Original Response: 
Edit 1: The points I am making is that Ariel is not pressing a controversial figure in MMA for reasons unknown.
The answer to the post title is obviously yes to a degree, but how far down does it extend?
Other journalists / other managers?
I will leave you with a quote from the most famous philosopher of our time.
Edgimus Brah - "look into it" 

&amp;#x200B;

So, a few thoughts after reading lots of Karim Zidan and Mike Russell (links at the bottom to both), one thing that came out in the wash was the possibility that Ali may have been the major source that Ariel Helwani constantly cited and got many major scoops from.
Ariel interviewed Ali many times and was very much aware of the work of Karim and Mike Russell but he really didn't press any of the key issues here.
With Ali recently calling Ariel the "Jerry Springer of MMA" and getting a touchy response back with "oh, this is rich" this could to some extent imply that Ali was implicated in much of the manufactured MMA drama that Ariel works so well with.
A few things of note:

&amp;#x200B;

A. Ali has the largest roster out of any manager in the UFC, subsequently significant access to content / information.
B. Ariel has historically been happy enough to push Dana White (and others) extremely hard in interviews who is possibly the most volatile person he could touch in his chosen profession.
There is no reason he shouldn't dig deep on Ali, there is the threat of being black-listed from fighters managed by Ali, but Dana can do much more damage and has in the past (banning Ariel from events / refusing future interviews / kicking out the MMA Fighting Staff from a UFC event)

B. Dana went on witch hunt in the UFC leaking false information trying to find the source.
However in theory it's possible that Ali had much of this info available either first or second hand.

C. Mike Russel retweeted this recently [https://twitter.com/ArabRevolt/status/1044045931472179200](https://twitter.com/ArabRevolt/status/1044045931472179200) "

"It’s wild how when Ariel brought up Ali’s past in a passing glancing way in his last in studio interview, he totally didn’t press him on any of the issues.
He also didn’t state the controversial nature of Ali’s history.
So annoying"

My point is, if the above is true or even partially true (eg.
Ali was a regular source, maybe not a primary source) then I wonder if Ariel will be able to still get the same scoops he seemingly pulled out nowhere previously.
For a while he was the Nostradamus of MMA, predicting things, Dana would deny then a few days later it would eventuate.
&amp;#x200B;

As as sidenote If you have the time, go read some work by Karim Zidan and Mike Russel, they are doing what appears to be a thankless job and are getting a lot off flack (Mike especially, check his twitter).
Much of it is really the tip of the iceberg and Ali is a small portion of their content, but holy shit some of it is real intriguing.

This is the case for most "journalists" in MMA, my friend.
It's PR—not journalism—95% of the time.
I'm saying this as somebody who is 100% OK with that and has contributed to this "problem."
There is very little digging to get those scoops.
They're usually spoon-fed or the response to a simple text message/phone call.
It's a "Hey, do me a favor" situation.
And doing a favor for somebody with Ariel's reach is good for business.
Edit: For sure Ali is/was/will be a huge source for Ariel, but he's far from Ariel's only source.
Ariel is the best-connected man in the business.
Thanks for the insight.
As someone inside so to speak, can you comment on not discussing controversial topics in exchange for the aforementioned information.
I have zero proof that's ever happened, but I think it follows logically that if you slam a manager/a manager's client (a fighter) that manager may not want to deal with you or hook you up in the future.
"Oh, you said some shit about me?
Guess I'll just hand this news over to *insert another website here* instead."
It's more a study in human relationships than journalism honestly.
These are not run of the mill allegations though.
The whole affair is entwined and has significant substance to it, even if it's halfway true.
Do you think it's irresponsible for someone not to engage with it in a more heavy handed fashion?
Ariel has the required protection to do this, I understand if smaller organizations won't or can't.
But he has always had a platform sustained by fans or whatever entity he is representing to push back.
He does it with promoters and pays the price.
Why not an individual manager?
Hey it's me your friend, I have a scoop.
It's called access journalism.
That's why I always laughed when people used to go on about how Ariel was the best "journalist" in MMA.
As if he revealed Brock was on UFC 200 was investigative journalism and not fishing for pageviews.
Just because something has acquired a name doesn't exempt it from criticism.
i didn't say that it is.
