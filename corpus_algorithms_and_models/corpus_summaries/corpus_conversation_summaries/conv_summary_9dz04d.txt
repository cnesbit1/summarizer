&gt; “We may see quite a few landlords pull their properties off the rental market,” he said.
Unless they sell the property, they aren't gonna be giving up rental income.
In some cases it may be worth more money for a landlord to keep a property empty and hock it off.
That's the whole thing with investment properties.
It's also why we need a big tax on empty properties.
If lots of landlords decide to sell it would then theoretically drop housing prices allowing more renters to buy.
Fair point.
Anything that causes landlords to say that looks awfully good at the moment.
Victoria has:

- Some of the worst tenants' rights in the developed world

- The worst housing bubble in history

If you're worried because people now have to feel cosy and safe in your investment property, which causes you to cash in on this squalor AND get a tax break, you might just be a psychopath.
These are basic human rights everywhere else.
Bidding on rentals and no-reason evictions are laughably evil in the developed world.
This news should be up there with the eight-hour day.
&gt; tax on empty properties.
I don't actually agree with empty property tax.
If you take an overseas posting for a year or two you shouldn't be forced to let strangers live in your family home, or penalised for not doing so.
I agree there's a need to not have rich people buy up areas and then have everything vacant - it can reduces vibrancy of the neighbourhood and can put local shops out of business.
Maybe you put a limit on how many properties someone can have without renting them out.
Like 2 properties max and the anything additional is taxed to hell?
Yeah that's fair.
Have their main residence in the country exempt from the tax.
&gt;I agree there's a need to not have rich people buy up areas and then have everything vacant - it can reduces vibrancy of the neighbourhood and can put local shops out of business.
It also causes prices to rise, and reduces the amount of properties on the rental market, which makes it harder for regular folks to buy or even rent homes.
No one is suggesting this would be applied to your permanent residence.
It would only be applied to additional properties.
Seriously though can you imagine the conversation

"Hey do you want 20k?"
"That's a firm NO"

"Umm.. why not"

"You might put a NAIL in the WALL.
I don't know how much it costs to patch a small hole but i'm pretty sure it's about 20k.
No thank you!"

Not going to be enough money in it, if everyone does AB&amp;B.
Yeah I know people that tried Air Bnb and have up.
Unless you are central to a city or pretty and coastal you cant really expect to be booked solid and the people i know that had a crack pulled it after not being woth the hassle.
Can't upvote this enough.
Agreed.
Five figure rental income is hard to pass up.
Plus we cant claim expenses back at tax time if the place is vacant and not a rental property.
Tenant: “Want 20k rental income?”
Landlord: “No.”
T: “How about 20k rental income so you can claim $25k bank interest, all council, strata, repair expenses and $5-10k depreciation and make a profit of a few grand?”
LL: “Oh yeah.
Maybe Ill rent to you and ya dog then”
Landlords accountant: “good boy”.
Housing isn't a human right.
e: If you are going to downvote me, then at least have the spine to actually refute what I have said.
Yeah that's not right.
Why is housing a human right?
What justifies housing being classified as a human right?
I know this is a left-wing sub and I know that such an ideology is deeply invested and interwoven with the Techno-Industrial societal complex, but if such a complex ceased to exist, is housing still a human right?
Victoria brought in an empty house tax too.
     Laughs in Sudanese.
i didnt downvote you yet but i will now.
No.
Housing is a human right because its essential to survival and its plentiful and trival for a government to provide it to people.
&gt;if such a complex ceased to exist, is housing still a human right?
If if such a complex ceased to exist (a government\nation state) then the context in which rights were relevant would be gone.

That's just a polite name for violently dispossessing Aboriginal people of their lands.
Weird point to make.
And what's your alternative?
Should people who can't afford housing be out on the street?
I bet you'd still expect them to continue being productive members of society, which can't happen with insecure housing.
Theres always one isnt there?
T: "Do you mind, sir?
That's actually my wife.
The dog is still in the car."
My alternative would be the complete and absolute eradication of capitalism, the technological-industrial society and the mass culling of large amounts of the population.
Thereby ensuring the strong will have land, housing and the surviving weak enslaved.
Just because men in suits slap "this is a human right" onto shit doesn't actually make it a human right.
Humans have the freedom to housing out of pure will, not a right to it.
Homelessness is probably a preferred way of living and even more noble - this of course excludes the homeless people that are junkies and in general just a bunch of parasites.
