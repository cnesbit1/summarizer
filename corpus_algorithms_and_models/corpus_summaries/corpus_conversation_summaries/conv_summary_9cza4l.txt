Original Response: 
I don't like to shit on anybody's ride.
My dad always told me "There is an ass for every seat".
This guys was proud of this bike, his father bought it brand new and when he got it, he "customized" it.
So what was it?

It was a fantastic and classic bike with a cult like following.
Seems like another UJM (which I like, don't get me wrong).
Am I missing something?
One of the fastest bikes of its day.
The original KZ was the undisputed king of the UJM's for a long, long time.
Really the Hayabusa of it's day.
Only 120mph w/ 82hp?
Was that because it ran out of gear?
These things really don't have a lot of top end torque.
They're muscle bikes.
They're worth 8-12k USD If very clean.
"It's not what you ride, it's that you ride".
An old Kawasaki Z1.
Also used in cult biker movies Stone and Mad Max.

Summary: 
"It's not what you ride, it's that you ride".
Really the Hayabusa of it's day.
