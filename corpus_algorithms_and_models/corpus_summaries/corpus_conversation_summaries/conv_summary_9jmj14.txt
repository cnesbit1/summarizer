Original Response: 
When I took him up on it, he was apologetic in reference to how sometimes he would literally almost just forget he was in a relationship and so he'd talk to me like I was his friend - so *NOTHING* about "oh and yeah, maybe *some* guys really do prefer natural boobs."
(I was telling him he was ridiculous for his assertion).
WTF??
So he *really* does believe this is true, and I just can't get over how someone's conviction on this could be *so* completely solid.
We ended up breaking up (not necessarily over this, but kinda - he ended up coming out as aro-ace; he had an all-encompassing fetish for enormous fake boob women and never really wanted to be in a relationship in the first place, which kinda fucked with me), and this is just one of those things which just really got stuck in my head I'm having a little trouble shaking..
I don't have serious issues thinking I need fake boobs, (*I fucking used to though*, lol) but I just want to hear from other guys.
ETA - Please *please* don't hate on women who have had surgery in the comments.
Opinions are cool but no mean stuff please.
I appreciate reassurance on my bf's comment but don't want any nasty or insulting stuff said about women who have had boob jobs.
&lt;3

**ETA - Stop insulting women with breast implants (or any other superficial reason),** ***please***.
It's really mean and not helpful.
He's full of shit.
9 out of 10 times, if I can tell the boobs are fake in porn, I switch the video.
Besides what reason is there to lie online?
I'm bi and also love boobs, but I'm not into fake boobs at all myself, and I thought some guys felt that way too (nothing personal at all against women who have had surgery), but the idea that ALL men have *one* preference this way absolutely floored me.
More than anything I guess it told me what ***he*** preferred, by a long shot..
I mean, shit, if a guy literally can't even mentally comprehend of another existing man in the world who prefers natural tits, that says a lot about how strongly he felt about fake boobs.
Damn.
That's pretty serious.
&gt; Besides what reason is there to lie online?
He thought it was like some sort of "image" thing for men to lie about boob preferences online - like I guess lots of upvotes or whatever for saying you prefer natural boobs I guess??
Fuck knows.
:S.
&gt; the idea that ALL men have one preference this way absolutely floored me.
There's your indicator.
There is no possible way every man in the world has the same preference.
Its literally not possible.
Heck, even 3 billion clones of the same person would have differences in preference.
Some people HATE fake boobs.
Some people absolutely love them.
I happen to think there is no such thing as fake boobs, because if you can lick them and touch them, then they are real.
People that like big fake boobs are disparaged and shamed for liking unnatural.
People that like smaller chests are disparaged for liking that.
Hell some people even go as far as calling them pedophiles or pederast's.
Bottom line is its a spectrum.
And there is someone, somewhere on every single point within it.
I wouldnt sweat any one person's preference.

I second this.
I spent plenty of time with aftermarket boobs.
They look fantastic when covered with clothes.
But, I’d take my wife’s perfect, natural breasts all day long.

Well I did get 60 internet points and still climbing since my reply; still no effect on my real life.
I think the anonymity and wealth of echo chambers on the internet encourages more brutal honesty than lying for karma.
I also should mention that I dont have anything against people with fake boobs either.
It's just not an aesthetic preference.
If it makes them happy, they should go for it.
I'm saying I switch when I can tell, not that I can tell 90% of time.
In fact I'm probably pretty bad at noticing.
I will edit to communicate that better.
I'd also take stiick's wife's perfect, natural tits all day long.

Some of us will say what we think regardless of upvotes or downvotes—or even regardless of what others will think of us in real life, not just on the Internet.
Just recently I argued why there's reason to think Kavanaugh is guilty.
Yeah, I received on some of these comments a whole lot of downvotes, but I just don't care.
In real life, I used to be a Jehovah's Witness (now atheist), and I used to preach door-to-door.
You bet your arse I got a few rude comments about that.
But I still did it because I believed in it.
I mean, I'm regularly on /r/sex for fuck's sakes, and some people think I have mental problems purely because of that—because, apparently, sex is shameful and everything and you're not supposed to talk about it...
Anyway, my advice?
Stop putting so much weight on your ex's words and opinions (in case you haven't stopped.)
He sounds like an intolerant, unintelligent jerk, though of course I might be wrong about some of this.
She’s still alive though...
Exactly 100%.
Now I didnt put my ex down for having fake boobs or think differently about her (it was the crazy that came out when drunk that did that part lol) but after going there I would prefer real boobs but it really doesnt matter if they are attached to someone you love which is the bottom line!
No, many of us guys share your preference.
My issue is a lot of fake boobs out there *look* fake.
Too round, too high, nipple placement, etc.
Some guys are specifically into that, but I find it a big turn off.
I'd rather have a girl with smaller nicely-shaped boobs, than giant ones that look like the doc tried to shove a couple volleyballs under her skin.
To this I will add though...
There are some skilled docs out there, and when women go for a more "reasonable" enlargement, they can come out looking much more natural, which I find more appealing than the other.
Also procedures where they inject natural fat, or some other substance...
Temporary, but I've seen some *amazingly* natural effects that way.
But yeah, I like a natural look most, and I've talked to a lot of guys who agree.
But there's also no such thing as universal preference, when it comes to sex.
Highly common, perhaps, but definitely not universal...
I can't believe there are men that prefer fake over natural that floors me.
I would tend to say the exact opposite of him and couldn't believe a guy would say they prefer fake.
I just like boobs.
And idk about you, by the person they're attached to makes them a hell of a lot more interesting and sexy than whether they're real or implants.
If I can touch them, they’re real.
They're like bags of sand.
But they're not coarse or irritating...
Although I like natural better than fake, I love ALL boobs when they’re bouncing in my face.
In the opposite.
I love them all when in my face, but I prefer them fake.
Depends on what they are attached to.
If it feels good tastes good it must be mine.
My husband loves natural but I've convinced him I'll get a set we both love.
Get one fake one real.
You can touch the fake, he can touch the real.
Win-win.
There's some really great ones on the market too.
People think of the early 90s bolt-ons, and if that's your thing - cool.
But there are so many other options now that feel incredible.
Do you prefer that they are fake or just big?
What's the difference?
[deleted]
Seriously.
Real, 'augmented', as long as they look nice, what's to complain about?
I love them big, like really big.
Fake is usually the way to get them to how I like.
They have a great shape and feel, whereas natural breasts that size typically don't.
But if you're going to have small boobs and you get implants to fill them out or make them perkier, or you have no boobs and get the bolt-on look, I love that too.
....and they don’t get everywhere.

Again, depends on who they're attached to.
It's amusing that non offensive opinions like this get downvoted here without attacking anyone.
Says a lot about some that come to this sub.
Fat transfer has come a long way and is an option.
See, you're puttin' the pussy on a pedestal.
Its Pussiliah.
My opinion is unpopular and I've shared it before with the same results.
It ***really*** pisses some people off pile I'm attacking them personally.
What's funny is that people like people made things, unless it affects their personal perception.
When you walk through the woods, you would think it cool to see ruins.
When you are lost in the desert, you're excited to see a city.
When you look at satellite images of earth it's neat to see them at night to see all the lights from all the people.
But as soon as it's body modification it makes everyone uncomfortable.
&amp;#x200B;

Needing fake boobs to feel like a person is not healthy, enjoying having gargantuan boobs is totally healthy.
Life is about connections.
It’s not about cocks and ass and tits.
And butthole pleasures.
[removed]
I'll pray for your cock.
Fuck yeah, I would be down for that.
Yes!
I have managed to feel maybe 3 or 4 sets.
They were not all equal.
Even in terms of shape.
Though I do wonder if the womans physiology has anything to do with it.

Summary: 
Fuck yeah, I would be down for that.
I love them all when in my face, but I prefer them fake.
But I still did it because I believed in it.
Fake is usually the way to get them to how I like.
Do you prefer that they are fake or just big?
