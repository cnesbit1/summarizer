&gt;25 teams have been able to scan more than 9,000 locations so far, but have not found any cameras yet.
Less than one in 9000.
Will they eventually find some?
Almost for sure.
Is it an epidemic?
No.
Turns out his ass was well supplied.
Your idea that because it's not an epidemic means it's not a problem disturbs me.
Less than one person per year gets eaten by a shark.
That doesn't mean that being eaten by a shark isn't a big deal.
No that’s actually the entire point.
The cost to enforce a policy like that would far outweigh the benefit it creates.
Your analogy makes no sense either.
“People don’t get eaten by sharks often but it’s still a big deal” no it’s not...... like, what cost effective solution is there to a person per year being eaten by sharks?
Idk enough about this problem to have an opinion one way or the other.
But you can’t have gut reactions to every little thing that happens in life.
If it happens enough to warrant checking the toilets then go for it.
But if it’s like what the other link said and there hasn’t been a single find in over 9000 toilets then...... it’s not that it’s a small problem, there literally is NO problem.
&gt;it’s not that it’s a small problem, there literally is NO problem.
Maybe check your sources next time.

&gt;  
&gt;*"South Korea is in the midst of a battle against sexual harassment.
Over the past year, the country’s #MeToo movement has taken down multiple high-profile men accused of harassment and assault, including Ahn Hee-jung, a rising star in the ruling democratic party.
"*  
&gt;  
&gt;*"Although concerns about spy cameras and illicit filming are far from new in South Korea, the problem appears to be growing.
The number of suspected perpetrators identified by the police rose from 1,354 in 2011 to 5,363 in 2017, and more than 95 per cent were men..."*  
&gt;  
&gt;*"... Police identified more than 26,000 victims of illicit filming between 2012 and 2016 of whom more than 80 per cent were female.
* ***But many never find out they are victims.
The real number “would be 10 times higher than the police figure” if the full extent were known***, *said Oh Yoon-sung, a criminology professor at Soonchunhyang University.

There's a literal term that Koreans used to describe these crimes.
"Molka", based off of a Korean hidden camera reality TV show.
These images are constantly flooding secret chats across social media and file sharing websites, the same way that news breaks of revenge porn Discords and private Facebook chats in the West.

Yeah.
What are you going to do about it?
You can force serves and hosts to take down these posts and increase penalties for these crimes, but you can't actually stop this.
Just like you can't stop shark attacks.
You can prevent them and mitigate their threats, but people shouldn't put on crusader helms, thinking that they can stop a pervasive crimes with reddit comments.
EDIT: Crime.
Ahhhh.
I'm getting hit with multiple responses to my comments on this thread.
I can't concentrate on one now.
26,000....... that’s over 4 years in a country of 51 MILLION.
Like, you site these sources as if they’re a trump card, but don’t even read what it says.
While it’s uncomfortable to know that it happens at all, the odds of it happening to you are so small it’s just a non-problem.
And it’s stupid that the guy reporting this at the end of your quote says “the real number would be 10 times higher if!” Bro there is a real number, and that’s the amount we’ve discovered.
I could believe a statement like “and there’s probably more we haven’t caught” but ten times higher?
Get the duck out of here, that puts into question the entire validity of the article you just linked.
Question.
Your logic is thus: 

&gt;26,000....... that’s over 4 years in a country of 51 MILLION.
Your logic is also thus:

&gt;If there hasn’t been a single find in over 9000 toilets then...... it’s not that it’s a small problem, there literally is NO problem.
How many public toilets do you think there are in South Korea, a nation of 51.25 million (in 2016)?
What percentage of that number do you think 9,000 is?
Just something to chew on.
Who's putting on crusader helms?
This thread has been entirely about whether the problem even *exists.
* We're hardly talking about fixing it, much less with reddit comments.
And no, you can't stop it entirely.
You can't stop anything entirely.
There will always be murders, rapes, child pornography charges, etc.
There will always be homelessness.
There will always be sickness.
That doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about those things, and try our best to lessen them.
Terminal illness is always going to be a thing.
That doesn't mean you would tell someone with terminal illness that they should just buck up, because there's nothing they can do.
And "preventing them and mitigating their effects" is exactly what this article, and the comments, are suggesting we do.
Nobody's considering waving a magic wand and making all the bad people disappear.
P.S.
Take your time.
I'm going to bed soon anyway, so I don't need an answer immediately.
LOL.
Thanks.
Your taking the 9000 statement out of context, I literally prefaced that with “if it’s true” I don’t really care enough to research it thoroughly beyond what people provide here.
So when someone provided a link that implied it was more frequent (26,000/51,000,000) I defaulted to that.
But since you asked I did do the math and found that out of 9000 toilets there would have been about 1/year with a camera in it.
Again.....
I don’t think 1 out of 9000 odds are that big of a deal.
Maybe if your talking about rockets.
But not when your talking about someone taking a shit.
Disturbing that it happens?
Sure.
An issue worth spending thousands of man hours on?
Probably not.
Unless they have a way to cheaply and effectively police it.
But yet again, I’m simply commenting on what I’ve seen in reddit.
I don’t live there so I don’t really have a vested interest in doing deeper research.
Maybe I'm just tired, or maybe you're smarter than I am, but how did you accurately calculate the number of public toilets in South Korea to be able to do those calculations?
And "thousands of man hours" is a bit off.
They're literally suggesting that when a custodian comes in to change the toilet paper, they also do a quick sweep for cameras.
The article tries to make it sound like a huge thing, but it really doesn't sound that labor-intensive.
Well I took 26000/51000000 which gave me the percent odds of a person becoming a victim to this specific thing.
Then I took that percentage and multiplied it by the above mentioned number of toilets searched so far.
It just so happens that if you plug in the number 9000 it rounds down to about 1/9000.
The number of toilets is arbitrary though, I could have said “out of 18000 toilets you would have found about 2-3 cameras depending on which way you round” 

It’s also not a perfect comparison because it’s not a 1-1 ratio between toilets and people but I would argue it’s probably pretty close.
Plus or minus a few cameras/toilet.
As far as having custodians doing it, they already clean the toilets themselves, what about “telling them to check toilets for cameras” is going to change what they were already doing?
This further strengthens my argument because if a public toilet was regularly being cleaned and tended too then there would have been no way for a camera to hide in the first place.
This (to me) indicates the problem itself wasn’t very big to begin with.
I’m not trying to cheapen the #metoo movement in SK.
It’s important.
But this is just a small part of it lumped on top of all the other “big” things that are happening which thus makes it seem bigger than it actually is.
You're pretending as if 26,000 isn't a big deal; as if this is a problem you can quantify based on fractional percentages of population density; as if probability of becoming a victim is based on population density.
You're wrong on all accounts.
First off, 26,000 is a big deal.
Any number you cannot physically count is a big deal - Penn Gillette says it best - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0Z0raWIHXk

There's this tendency when we talk about crime to view things in terms of scale and mathematics.
The problem with this is that magnitude of scales severely downplays the severity of crime the larger the numbers get.
By population percentage, it doesn't seem like a big deal, but by sheer number it is;

* South Korea has gotten more victims from one sex crime in just 4 years, than 45/50 US states individually have had sex offenders from all sex crimes in 11+ years.
* In 2007, all states of the US developed a national registry for the surveillance of sex offenders
    * As of Spring 2018, only 5 states have had more than 26,000 registered sex offenders
      * The ratio of victims-to-offenders is NOT 1:1 (multiple offenders can assault a victim, multiple victims can be assaulted by one offender), so 26,000 registered sex offenders doesn't mean 26,000 victims of sexual assault necessarily, but it does mean 26,000 cases where justice was served so the meat of the idea still stands.
Secondly, this isn't a problem of population percentages.
It's the rate at which this molka problem is growing.
* In 4 years, it went from 1300 to 5300 perpetrators.
It doubled, 3 times in 4 years.
* South Korea's molka problem is only one crime, and at 6000 victims per year, it's about a fifth the yearly number of victims as a crisis center in California assisting rape victims -- and worst of all there are women that don't know they're victims.
* There's still many perpetrators at large, that number is only going to continue to grow.
And at the rate it's growing, it's bound to double again within 18 months.
Thirdly, a bunch of your math doesn't check out because of a bunch of undefined/unknown numbers.
The number of bathrooms being sweeped by public servants in solely city of Seoul is irrelevant in private businesses who don't employ public servants to clean their bathrooms.
* For every train station, airport, or park bathroom in Seoul, there are 25+ separate commercial buildings all of which are required to have bathrooms ***per gender, per floor, for the entire country***
    * One 5 story office complex could have up to 15 bathrooms, 3 per floor (male, female, family/other).
* One restaurant can have up to 6 rooms (3 public bathrooms, 3 private locker/restrooms)
    * Skyscrapers... 3 bathrooms per wing of the building, per floor

They can sweep as many public bathrooms as they want and still never uncover any spy cams if the majority of the crimes committed aren't in public bathrooms.
Also, it goes without saying that these spy cams can be set up **anywhere** and look like anything.
It's not necessarily sexual content being filmed, it could just be voyeuristic.
Creepy candids.
Not necessarily someone using a toilet.
* They can be set in napkin dispensers at a local coffee shop any time a person spills coffee on their shirt, and because it's not a bathroom, it'll never be discovered by a public servant.
* Ditto for any chair or desk or table for an upskirt shot.
* Any heavily trafficked area where an unsuspecting victim readjusts their clothing and accidentally flashes the camera.
The odds of you running into a bathroom camera might be low based on these published figures, but given how easy spy cams are able to be set up -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEnKR1kzoHc -- we can't possibly know the probability.
We only know that it's higher than you might initially think.
What we do know, however, is that probability cannot be measured by raw numbers of populations, but instead has to be measured based on an event.
* Per square mile, you are more likely to run into a molka victim in South Korea than you are to run into a sex offender in SoCal (where 1/5 of California roughly equals South Korea's landmass).
* Per square mile, you are more likely to run into a molka victim in South Korea than you are to run into a sex offender in the entirety of New York state (New York being barely larger in size than Korea).
These probabilities are just based on the number of victims that were uncovered by investigations.
We don't know about the victims that haven't been discovered/unreported/etc.
And your immediate dismissiveness of the potential 10x more victims, is ridiculous considering that this quote comes from a criminology professor whose literal job is to study trends and patterns in criminal activities -- of which, if he's drawing a parallel to another sex crime like assault that he would have also studied the victim count could be within 10x greater.
Lol, I’m working with the numbers people are giving me here dude, your working (mostly) with imaginary numbers and assumptions.
Is there more than what’s caught?
Sure.
Is it “10X greater”?
Fuck no.
It is nowhere’s near that common.
Is SK worse compared to other places?
Idk, haven’t looked it up, maybe they are?
But even if they’re worse,  that doesn’t make it a common occurrence.
26000 over four years simply isn’t a lot in a country of 51,000,000.
They know it’s not a lot too.
That’s why they take a total of four years worth of crime because if they reported it in a yearly amount it would truly seem insignificant.
All right.
I still disagree with you, and I still think this is an important thing to happen.
But it sounds like neither of us have the appropriate context to take this discussion any further.
I just heard of this phenomenon on this one post, and it sounds like you did too.
You've made some good points, but I think the ultimate determination of whether or not this is a big problem has to be made by the women being affected.
So I'm gonna scroll up and join the conversation which includes actual South Korean women.
Thanks for talking.
&gt;your working (mostly) with imaginary numbers and assumptions.
Mostly imaginary numbers?
* The number of victims that crisis centers served in California in 2011-2012 is 31,790 - http://www.calcasa.org/what-we-do/about-sexual-violence/

* The numbers of sex offenders in the US per state are tracked by a registry and public knowledge online - https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/state-by-state-numbers-of-registered-sex-offenders-in-the-us.html

* The number of sex offenders in New York as of Spring 2018 is 32,257 .
* The landmass size of New York is 141,300 square kilometers.
* The landmass size of South Korea is 100,210 square kilometers.
* The landmass size of California is 423,970 square kilometers.
SoCal is roughly 1/5 the size of that, putting the landmass at 84,794 square kilometers, well within the landmass size.
Basic building codes in the US require separately gendered bathrooms, with at least 3 toilets per restroom when a building occupancy is greater than 35 people.
With Korea having a higher population density, their building codes require, without a doubt, more restrooms.
Most buildings with multiple floors require these per floor.
&gt;Is there more than what’s caught?
Sure.
Is it “10X greater”?
Fuck no.
It is nowhere’s near that common.
You have no idea of what you're talking about.
A criminology professor would be studying trends in sexual assault cases and have access to the relevant numbers in Korea.
Using statistics from other sex crimes, a criminologist would be able to determine a rough estimate of more than what is caught.
And we have statistics here in the US that can corroborate that claim.
&gt; http://www.calcasa.org/what-we-do/about-sexual-violence/
&gt; * California’s rape crisis centers served 31,790 survivors of sexual violence in the state during fiscal year 2011-2012 
&gt; * There are an estimated 2 million female victims of rape in California.
&gt; * 5.6 million women in the state have been victims of sexual violence other than rape.
Despite only having served 32,000 women in a year, there's nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher of the confirmed cases of rape and other sexual violence.
&gt; They know it’s not a lot too.
That’s why they take a total of four years worth of crime because if they reported it in a yearly amount it would truly seem insignificant.
You're being cynical and trying to downplay the entirety of this situation when this is a huge problem.
You're trying to apply non-applicable probability, when the probability is much higher given how simple and easy it is.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45040968

They're reporting the total growth from the starting point that they've taken action against these crimes, which they haven't even tried diverting resources to this problem until recently.
You don't understand the hyper-masculine culture in South Korea.
You don't understand the sexist social rules in South Korea that can utterly disgrace a person if you don't follow them, nor the pressure to constantly be on your guard for fear of loss of social standing, reputation, leadership positions.
&gt; They're literally suggesting that when a custodian comes in to change the toilet paper, they also do a quick sweep for cameras.
The article tries to make it sound like a huge thing, but it really doesn't sound that labor-intensive.
Custodians are given a series of tools used to locate cameras, much like these - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7q_lD8C7c8

It actually is kind of labor intensive.
These are huge leaps.
-Why is California a useful data model for SK?
-Same with New York

You’re conflating this issue with ALL of sex crimes, all predators, and all victims.
-most victims suffer from interpersonal violence
-the vast majority of six offenders are also for interpersonal crimes and were not strangers to their victims.
-landmass is irrelevant without respect to population density.
You use landmass data as significant yet recognize population only to further your argument later.
-US building codes are not Korean building codes
-seeing as how this primarily effects women it would be more accurate to subtract at least 1/3 of the total number.
-you’re conflating voyeurism with rape and types of sexual violence that involve contact— many of these types of predators never commit those types of crimes.
A criminology professor would not make such shitty leaps and bounds with data.
Feel free to try to submit this sort of reasoning to any professor and see what they say, but you just posted a bunch of “proof” and yet there is no conclusion for how much you think this happens in raw numbers or by percent of population— does all this amount to 10x the number initially debated?
Do you know?
Do you know how this would even work out mathematically?
You only multiplied land mass and basic populations.
There are so many confounding factors between what you posted and what you’re trying to prove.
&gt;-Why is California a useful data model for SK?
-Same with New York

I'm trying to convey probability, ~~but you seem to dismiss this at every instance.~~ You're marking probability on things by population when probability doesn't use raw population.
It uses events.
The event here is --  walking around in that location, you have a higher probability of running into a molka victim in South Korea than you do running into a New York sex offender walking around in New York.
&gt;You’re conflating this issue with ALL of sex crimes, all predators, and all victims

No, I'm not.
I've given you a number of estimated crimes, of which nonconsensual voyeurism is one of those crimes.
~~That's what you don't seem to realize.~~

&gt; Do you know how this would even work out mathematically?
You only multiplied land mass and basic populations.
You're trying to downplay this without knowing it yourself, and then saying "lol this isn't a big deal" just on the opinion of a criminology professor who may or may not have stats to back it up.
I used California stats as a point of reference because of the similarity in political demographic, and the fact that there's more densely populated areas in California than other states.
Even if nonconsensual voyeurism only constituted 1% of all of those estimated crimes in California, molka is about a fifth of that estimate ***and rising***.
I’m not the person you were arguing against.
I’m a person who came across this thread and thought “wow what a reach”—-so at least quote the right person.
You don’t take into account culture, proportional demographics.
And your probability is deeply flawed because you don’t take into account gender (most of victims are 1/2 the population), you only listed various statistics and yet never isolated what percent of those statistics represented the argument at hand.
I brought up the bullshit criminology professor because you initially applied it to your process as if you had any idea what a criminology professor would really think of this bullshit.
A better representation is .5(51million)=25.5 million

26,000/25.5 million= x/100 approximately 0.00102
Divide by 4 for 4 years = 0.000255
So even if it was TEN TIMES higher
0.00255% of South Korean women are victims of this crime annually and with average life expectancy of Korean women taken into account a woman would have a 0.219% chance of this happening over he course of her life, with variation of +/- 1% based on lifestyle.
California and New York are not accurate representations of external validity in this instance as the way we come forward, define and prosecute crimes in this country are very different from SK, especially when it comes to cyber crimes.
There is no doubt that for the women this happens to it is widespread and humiliating.
After all it’s not a picture or video kept by the perp but one that is shared thousands of times, exposing victims to a degree where I think it would appear more widespread than it actually is.
&gt;I’m not the person you were arguing against.
I’m a person who came across this thread and thought “wow what a reach”—-so at least quote the right person.
Crossed out sections aside, my points still stand.
&gt; you only listed various statistics and yet never isolated what percent of those statistics represented the argument at hand.
It's not a matter of isolating statistics to percentages.
I already said this multiple times, the higher the numbers you're dealing with, the less people seem to care about this on a human level and start downplaying the severity of the crime.
Any number that's above the thousands already is a problem.
Whether or not it's proportional to a crime in the US or not, it's still thousands of people whose lives can be negatively impacted.
Which is where the "you are more likely to run into a molka victim" plays in.
This removes the order of magnitude comparison and just shows you a more comprehensible understanding of the probability.
No dehumanized "odds are X, you're fine, don't worry"... it becomes localized to something you can tangibly comprehend.
Furthermore, the idea is that if there are an estimated 5.6 million women having falling victim to a sexual assault other than rape living in California, nonconsensual voyeurism is a number of that overall figure of 5.6 million.
Even at 1%, that's still a potential of 56,000 women falling victim.
Suddenly that 26,000 number (6,000) per year doesn't seem as small, especially when this number continues to grow as more investigations are conducted.
&gt;So even if it was TEN TIMES higher 0.00255% of South Korean women are victims of this crime annually and with average life expectancy of Korean women taken into account a woman would have a 0.219% chance of this happening over he course of her life

You can't view the "odds" of something happening based on raw percentages of populations.
A person doesn't have a 0.219 percent chance of this happening to them just because they're just 1 out of 51 million population with an average life expectancy.
It's not that rudimentary, we're dealing with an unknown population of victims, compared to something like a shark attack which has confirmed victims and reportings -- the value continually changes as more and more investigations uncover unique victims in these revenge porn websites.
If you believed your last paragraph you wouldn’t have presented an argument filled with descriptive statistics... you can’t argue on a statistical level then come back and say that the odds and statistics don’t matter and it’s about the human level.
If you believe that the larger the number you’re dealing with the less people care, it’s counterintuitive to use an argument based on numbers to try and elicit a response (but I digress) 

I’m not saying it’s not an issue that it’s happening.
It is an issue.
But the prevalence of a crime should be a consideration when thinking about how to tackle the issue.
It is obvious by the study linked that the number of hours expended by police yielded few results, so we should be looking at procedures that tackle it effectively.
You can care about an issue without exaggerating its prevalence.
You flip flop between arguing (poorly) that it is a greater issue than it is and saying that it’s not the prevalence of the issue that matters.
I'm not arguing that it's a greater issue.
I'm telling someone off for saying that it's not issue.
That person called it a non-issue because it doesn't seem proportionally significant to a crime in the west, and routinely used the 51 million population as evidence to definitively say, "it's not a problem, it's barely anything out of 51 million, it's being blown out of proportion".
He's viewing it through a lens of cynicism and mathematics, when the problem is supposed to be viewed through empathy and on a human level.
I used stat and examples to help explain it in a more comprehensible manner, making it comparably more of a problem than he initially realized, and stated that his math doesn't check out because of a bunch of extraneous factors.
Thank you for doing what I would have had to anyway.
This guy just doesn’t get it.
You can point out again and again that his “proof” isn’t proof, but in the end he won’t yield.
If that criminology professor was worth a shit he wouldn’t make vague statements like “it’s likely there’s 10X as much as we’ve found”.
This is classic tabloid bs where thy find an “expert” who drums up the drama into something bigger than it is.
Disturbing that this stuff happens?
Absolutely.
But ultimately I agree with you in that it’s being overblown and the odds of it actually happening to any given person are slim.
The original debate centered around weather it was worth trying to enforce something and was the cost vs benefit worth it.
To that I said probably not.
But it depends on how cheap they can do it.
It’s an issue sure.
It’s just non-issue in the face of literally almost every other problem in the world besides shark attacks and lightening strikes.
I honestly think that if you weren’t so obtuse you’d understand that the person has said many times over and over again that saying there’s NO problem isn’t to suggest that it doesn’t happen or that it isn’t horrible, it was merely a generalization that the problem is so small that the amount of media attention and hysteria over this issue makes it seem far more prevalent than it is and that such an aggressive approach won’t work both to effectively protect women in this situation or fiscally.
That’s why he used shark attacks as an example.
Are shark attacks horrible?
Yes.
Are they such a statistical issue that it would be efficient to have the coast guard try sail every coast every morning to make sure they aren’t there?
NO!
In this instance a far more effective preventative measure would be signal blockers in bathrooms for anything exceeding a certain bandwidth and signs posting such.
But you are so wrapped around proving this is some widespread phenomena and then backpedaling that the numbers aren’t even the issue.
He’s not being cynical— he’s being realistic.
Mathematics aren’t dehumanizing if you remember what you’re talking about.
Your numbers are far more flawed statistically than his.
Again you cannot even narrow yours down— you just state a bunch of descriptive statistics and multiply for area, arguably the least valid of the numbers you presented.
To make yours an accurate representation you’d need the raw numbers of those who engage in this type of crime, you’d need to adjust for cultural differences between the US and SK, and base your percentages on SK population, not US.
His deductive reasoning is far more accurate than your inductive reasoning mathematically.
And his approach is more realistic than yours.
You’re just too caught up in the emotions of it all— which is great as a direct care provider, just don’t try to play it off as if it is a good determinant or policy.
This is why I hate when changing rooms or toilets don't have proper ceilings.
For some reason a fair number are open into the plumbing and wiring - it seems like it would be super easy to hide a camera in a roof space like that.
Especially if it's above the lights where you get glare looking up.
I wonder if any architect has considered this.
I am about a year from being an architect, but I work as one essentially.
It’s all about budget.
ACT (acoustic ceiling tile) are cheaper because they allow more flexibly HVAC and electrical as opposed to gyp board where you have to plan but not that much.
The gyp soffit is more expensive, paint, etc.
I like it more because it just looks clean.
Most architects are putting in gyp board ceilings.
I can’t even think of a code as to why we would pick Gyp over ACT.
The gyp is easier to clean considering the location.
My guess is those bathrooms were where the client wanted to lower the budget.
Edit: geez.
I wrote this when I was half asleep:  ACT.
Acoustic Ceiling TILE is what I was thinking.
(Grid usually 2x4 or 2x2).
Fixed it above.
My apologies.
Both ACP and ACT are both used/said/understood in the industry.
I’ve been hanging out more contractors lately.
They get fluid with their terms, but ACT is the term we use in our specifications.
It is.
I used to install security cameras in bars and restaurants that have open ceilings like this.
It's child's play to install something in a ceiling like that.
Target sucks for change rooms.
Depending which stall you go in, sometimes you can literally see the security cameras in the main floor from the change stall.
They seriously suck, fuck you target.
[deleted]
Plus their mirrors make me look fat, so the cameras don't even get my best angles.
Fuck you, Target!
Good luck with your licensing!
🤗thank you!
It’s a lot of work, but it’ll be worth it.
The mall from my grade school years had a woman's changing room covered above with a bunch of diagonal boards that you could see through if you were above them from the correct angle.
Why would I know this?
Because the escalator rode right past this position for some unfathomable reason and it was pretty exciting for us 9 year olds.
I did exactly that to successfully catch a thief in our office.
Worked like a charm.
&gt;I wonder if any architect has considered this

They did, that's why the ceiling is open, so they can hide cameras easier.
It sucks that this is even a topic.
Like, I know intimacy and all kinds of needs ought to be considered in public space design.
Just gets me sad that we can't live in such a basic harmony that creepy spying wouldn't be a topic.
ELI5: ACP/Gyp ?
Acoustic Ceiling Panel or Acoustic Ceiling  Tile.
Those 2x4 to 2x2 grids.
Depending on the space, but that’s the typical size you’ll see.
Gyp short for Gypsum board or drywall.
Usually 5/8” things come in 8x4 sheets.

I don't think architects studied perv tactics..

Summary: 
Why would I know this?
I like it more because it just looks clean.
Thank you for doing what I would have had to anyway.
To that I said probably not.
It's insane that this is even a problem.
I can't concentrate on one now.
Your numbers are far more flawed statistically than his.
What percentage of that number do you think 9,000 is?
They know it’s not a lot too.
Acoustic Ceiling TILE is what I was thinking.
&gt; They know it’s not a lot too.
I wonder if any architect has considered this.
* ***But many never find out they are victims.
These probabilities are just based on the number of victims that were uncovered by investigations.
Any number that's above the thousands already is a problem.
You have no idea of what you're talking about.
Which is where the "you are more likely to run into a molka victim" plays in.
Do you know how this would even work out mathematically?
I’m not the person you were arguing against.
I am about a year from being an architect, but I work as one essentially.
It's the rate at which this molka problem is growing.
I don’t think 1 out of 9000 odds are that big of a deal.
Secondly, this isn't a problem of population percentages.
Less than one in 9000.
I just heard of this phenomenon on this one post, and it sounds like you did too.
&gt;it’s not that it’s a small problem, there literally is NO problem.
Less than one person per year gets eaten by a shark.
"*

There's a literal term that Koreans used to describe these crimes.
It doubled, 3 times in 4 years.
It sucks that this is even a topic.
&gt; * 5.6 million women in the state have been victims of sexual violence other than rape.
But the prevalence of a crime should be a consideration when thinking about how to tackle the issue.
It just so happens that if you plug in the number 9000 it rounds down to about 1/9000.
I can’t even think of a code as to why we would pick Gyp over ACT.
It’s a lot of work, but it’ll be worth it.
We don't know about the victims that haven't been discovered/unreported/etc.
I'm not arguing that it's a greater issue.
I don't think architects studied perv tactics..
26,000....... that’s over 4 years in a country of 51 MILLION.
First off, 26,000 is a big deal.
Your idea that because it's not an epidemic means it's not a problem disturbs me.
Just like you can't stop shark attacks.
It's not a matter of isolating statistics to percentages.
&gt;You’re conflating this issue with ALL of sex crimes, all predators, and all victims

No, I'm not.
Not necessarily someone using a toilet.
I still disagree with you, and I still think this is an important thing to happen.
I'm telling someone off for saying that it's not issue.
I've given you a number of estimated crimes, of which nonconsensual voyeurism is one of those crimes.
This is why I hate when changing rooms or toilets don't have proper ceilings.
