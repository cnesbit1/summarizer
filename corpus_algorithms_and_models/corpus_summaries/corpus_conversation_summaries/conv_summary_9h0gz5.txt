Original Response: 
Why would Bernie be giving a victory speech when he lost Florida in the Democratic Primary?
You might be on to something.
I think that the FLA at the bottom is a ticker.
I thought it was possible that Bernie could have won another state that same day.
However, I looked at all the primaries on March 15 and they were all won by Hillary.
This may be fake news.
Looks to be legit:

&gt; Why would Bernie be giving a victory speech when he lost Florida in the Democratic Primary?
Nice try.
Oh, theres no question that the MSM dissed Bernie while giving Trump an enormous amount of unwarranted airplay.
But the OP states that on this given night Bernie was being ignored while giving a "victory speech" which is flat out not true.
The worst part about MSM shorting Sanders is that the DNC and Hilary were the ones that made sure he wasn't given a fair shot.
When Dems are putting down other Dems, of course Reps will win.
&gt; Oh, theres no question that the MSM dissed Bernie while giving Trump an enormous amount of unwarranted airplay.
&gt; 
&gt; 

I think there's plenty of question about this.
Every time I watch MSM coverage, it was about how Sanders was creating a movement with young people and Clinton was bogged down by her email scandal.
I swear people who say that Sanders was slighted didn't really pay attention to general coverage during the primaries.
Yeah the leaked DNC Emails proved the primary was rigged in Hillary's favor, which pissed off Sander's supporters, who in turn voted for Trump.
Which is why this sub is heavily brigaded and manipulated.
It's Russia's fault though 🙄.
Not to mention how they wouldn't even let Lessig participate.
Nope.
He was black balled.
Even NPR was guilty of shorting his air time vs Hillary.
This graphic really puts it into perspective as to why Trump ultimately won.

Holy shit... they *really* went for the Trump ratings boost.
I think the picture of the empty podium is just meant as a visual representation of the "pied piper" campaign the corporate media was running for the Clinton camp.
Rather than meaning to mislead people into thinking Bernie won Florida in 2016 (which would be a ridiculous deception toward what end exactly?
), they probably just pulled a random screencap of an empty Trump podium without regard to the full context of the screencap.
There were multiple examples of Bernie doing well in primaries and being ignored while Trump was pushed to the front.
There were even cases of Bernie winning clearly while the corporate media trotted out the superdelegates to make it seem like he lost anyway.
I don't have a problem with the meme using a photo of Trump's empty podium to make the point that Trump was championed while Bernie was ignored, even if that particular instance the empty podium happened to be from a day when Bernie wasn't on top.
https://www.thenation.com/article/the-discourse-suffers-when-trump-gets-23-times-as-much-coverage-as-sanders/

People have tracked and studied how much coverage the different candidates received.
It's not a mystery who got the most attention and who got the least.
To claim that Sanders wasn't artificially ignored by the corporate media who was supporting Clinton is to be a liar.
From an RES tag; you be the judge:

&gt;NYT is still top notch as far as journalism goes.
Ignore editorial stuff if it bothers you, but the investigative side is still excellent.
-OstentatiousDinosaur.
It revolves cnn of course it’s fake news.
Just to be clear: the empty podium isn't just a meme.
CNN literally aired this video shot in real time with verbal commentary over top.
You should just delete the last sentence.
Ad hominem.
He really only spent $10 million?
&gt;(of an argument or reaction) directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining.
Can you explain how quoting their position itself is an ad hominem?
By "meme", I meant the the post with the image and accompanying text that we're all commenting on.
I didn't mean to suggest the "pied piper" campaign was "just a meme" or something, it definitely really happened.
Hillary was literally in bed with the MSM.
you're lying.

1 in 10 Berners voted for Trump.
A nearly identical ratio of Obama voters voted for Trump.
There were far more Obama voters than Bernie primary voters.
The problem isn't simply that Hillary turned off independent progressives, she couldn't even get party loyalists to come out to vote after the shit she pulled.
She was so godawful that she couldn't even beat a barely-literate, racist, misogynistic, game show host trust fund brat con-man with stupid hair, baby-diarrhea-colored skin, and the most punchable face in modern memory.
*THAT's how bad she was.
* 

Edit: More insults.
I wasn't done venting.
Still bitter.
The DNC honestly could have just not let him run at all, considering he's not even part of the Democratic party.
They gave him way more of a fair shot than I would have expected.
It's like if you're at a tennis torunament and some rando from the crowd wants to challenge the semifinalist for their spot even though he wasn't registered, and the semifinalist *agrees* and even gives him a racket to play with, then beats him in 3 straight sets, but at some point the referee called one ball "in" when it was questionably close to the baseline, so you conclude "he wasn't given a fair shot!"
Yeah, maybe he would have won that one point if the referee hadn't been biased, and we can all agree the referee sucked for that, but it clearly didn't make a difference in the match.
Because his or her opinion on the NYT is completely irrelevant to his discussion on the MSM's coverage of Bernie.
You are trying to discredit him because of his past statements rather than trying to discredit his current argument.
Time for my ad hominem: it's weird and unusual that you have an RES tag for someone because he or she believes the NYT has good investigative journalism.
You're biasing yourself for every future comment based on what media they find credible.
I think you should post a screenshot on r/politics.
I wonder if they put so much about trump because the elites wanted him to win or because he’s just an entertaining bafoon.
I don’t know a single Sanders supporter who ended up voting for Trump.
Trump is the antithesis of Sanders.
I was a diehard Bernie supporter during the primaries, even volunteered with his campaign in my state as a precinct captain.
I voted for Trump in the general.
To me he was the lesser of two evils.
In my eyes a vote for her was a vote condoning the actions they took against Bernie and if she had won there would be no consequences for their actions and no reason not to do it again.
That's not how our government is suppose to work.
The parties aren't suppose to pick favorites, the media giants aren't suppose to censor candidates and mislead the public in favor of another.
Honestly the way the primaries played out it's something you'd expect from third world countries.
Neither of them were my choice but my choice was robbed from me by Clinton and her goons in the DNC.
I've guessing both the DNC and media assumed Trump would fold/be decimated (the DNC might have had the Access Hollywood tape all along) and the media thought it would be harmless to milk the ratings boost that Trump-related content gave them (due to Trump fans and hatewatchers).
There is also the theory that the media likes to promote perceived underdog candidates in general in order to boost them to make the race closer (given that a closer race draws more attention from views).
Who are you kidding?
It would get like 0 upvotes and 30 comments, saying to the OP to go back to [TD you dumb idiot](https://i.imgur.com/ER6Eq7r.png)
Some of us voted for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.
I don't think I'll ever vote Democrat again, they are as corrupt as the Republicans.
Oh, and many of us remember watching the tragedy of the North Dakota Access Pipeline, where people were shot w water in freezing weather, and not a peep from the media.
(With the sole exception of Ed Schultz!)
You need to get out more then.
Many Bernie people voted Trump.
Holy shit!
A reasonable Trump voter.
Well I’ll be a sin of a gun.
Ain’t that some shit.
Dang.
Why did it have to be Trump though?
Why couldn’t it have been one of the Paul’s?
Republicans have a lot to answer for just like the Clintonians.
That would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad on so many different levels.
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
Trump is not a Republican...hello.
Can you point me to the part of that article that shows that Clinton received more positive coverage than Sanders?
Because I can't find any sections with this analysis.
I stand by every word.
NYT does good journalism.
Seriously, what the fuck America...

We’re so easily distracted, we can be comfy cozy and forgot how really weird things are becoming..

Or is it just really weird we can see it so easily now as before it was more difficult... 

Fire side chats with the president lol.
Oh I’m sorry the leader of the Republican Party, who espouses Republican opinions, values Republican politicians and only believes Republican media is NOT a Republican?
Dafuq?
No, that has been debunked.
Sanders voters did NOT vote for Trump.
This is one reason Hillary won the popular vote - the actual voters ended up voting for her.
She lost, not because of Sanders voters, but because of super delegates.
The Paul's were running.
Johnson was the libertarian candidate.
Oh, don't act like the Democratic party was all candy canes and rainbows by allowing Sanders to run on their ticket at all.
He has voted with Democrats 99 percent of the time and the only way he is truly different from them is that he is more liberal and never gave up the Democratic parties original roots as an anti-war party.
Him running as a Democrat was strategic of him yes, but he is not "not a Democrat".
Furthermore, his beliefs and voting base are "Democrats".
If you think the DNC was going to tell him " No", you can't run as a Democrat, you're deluded.
They used him as much as he used them.
They were NOT going toet him run as an independent where they couldn't themselves harness his voters, which are largely, *their* voters.
You mean your red tag that you wrote?
Yea, not bias at all and everyone should believe your ad hominem attack, amirite?
&gt; No, that has been debunked.
Sanders voters did NOT vote for Trump.
This

I did.
One reason.......tariffs &amp; negotiating better trade deals.
Bushes, Clinton &amp; Obama sold United States workers down the fucking river when it comes to trade.
Not on tariffs &amp; trade he wasn't.
I like [this one.

What!?
Super delegates **are a DNC primary thing** and Clinton had almost all of them.
You do not know what you are talking about.
wtf are you talking about man...
I voted Sanders primary and Trump in General, get the fuck outta here with your denial.
MILLIONS of Sanders voters ended up voting Trump once they realized how fucking corrupt the DNC and Clintons are.
Secondly... the only reason she WON the primary was because of **super delegates** you dumbass.
She lost the general because of the **electoral college**.
Get your facts straight.
Lol tell that to the soybeans farmers and hot ranchers.
BINGO!
The Pied Piper strategy really backfired LOL.
No, I just used the wrong term.
Implant the correct term in my statement and the point is correct.
Using the wrong term doesn't destroy an argument.
No, I just used the wrong term.
Implant the correct term in my statement and the point is correct.
Using the wrong term doesn't destroy an argument.
Furthermore, your anecdote (and its just that, an anecdote) that YOU voted for Trump doesn't support this made up claim that millions of Bernie supports voted for Trump.
This was disproved when the Clinton camp tried to blame Bernie for trump.
The Clinton camp and DNC had no one to blame but themselves.
Clinton campaign and the DNC is what drove MILLIONS of Sanders voters to vote for Trump in the general election.. just look through the comments of people confirming this you schmuck.
Deny it all you want but millions of people who voted for Obama, voted for Trump.
Likewise, millions of people who voted for Sanders in the primary, voted for Trump.
[removed]
I'm worried this will lead to the media changing tactics to ignore candidates they don't like.
I know they already do it, but will they take it to a new level of just being silent on Trump while running 24/7 stories on the candidate they want.
Also from that article:

&gt;Hillary Clinton last week got similarly dissed by the networks in favor of Trump.
[link](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-networks_us_56df9346e4b0860f99d72720)
You forgot about Amy Goodman.
Why not join us Libertarians?
You think it inconceivable that 2% of Trump voters also voted for Bernie in the primary?
Best of luck to you, it's going to be a loooooong 6n1/2  years of MAGA

LOL.
You said that perfectly.
Wish I could give several upvotes.
If its on TV it aint real.
Is a favour really, just like shills giving away the reason they actually there.
Corporate choir is my crystal ball.
I know, they usually do run but they never get even a slight chance but they’re the most reasonable republicans out there.
I don’t agree with everything they stand for but they’re not likely to throw the other side under the bus just to get what they want.
I was.
I did.
You cant say anything in any sub on reddit minus a few without getting downvoted to hell by an army of insane liberal people.
You're naive if you ever thought Lessig would get anywhere in the primaries, as much as I like Lessig.
And far more butthurt Hillary voters voted for McCain in 2008 than Bernie voters for Trump.
Except most Sanders supporters voted for Clinton.
Russia was involved in the election.
So yes, Russian meddling did impact the election.
So even after Sanders endorsed Clinton and Trump pursued opposite policies then Sanders you still voted for Trump?
How "progressive" of you.
It’s not like Bernie was doing well with minorities tho.
He wasn’t even competitive in the South and his best states were ones designed to have lower turnout (caucus states).
I think we’re all forgetting how much of a battle he had to fight to even compete with Hillary.
Barely no one off of reddit knew about him until he thought about running and becoming a Democrat.
Still not sure what the correct thing you are trying to say is...  are you talking about electoral college votes?
That almost makes sense except the argument is then:  “She only lost because she did not win the US election.”.
[removed]
Jesus.
Simple:

She won the popular vote because Sanders voters did infact, vote for her.
She lost the election because she lost the electoral college.
I had originally used the wrong term "super delegates".

And you a an anecdote.
You don't represent millions of people who did as you did.
We have facts that tell us that Sanders voters overwhelmingly ended up supporting Clinton, hence her large popular vote numbers.

I think you're absolutely right about the meme accidentally using a screen cap with a misleading detail.
And I don't have any evidence that Clinton's campaign colluded with CNN, as incredibly plausible as it is (losers don't need special investigators).
But I do vividly remember being outraged in real time how Sanders was ignored and mocked.
And I remember left-leaning broadcasts like the Daily Show and Democracy Now basically using this meme the day it happened.
I knew all about that pipeline and I supported its construction...
I didn't like the way the protesters were treated but I place the blame solely on the propagandists that whipped them up into a protest movement, during which they sabotaged the pipeline.
That pipeline was a desperate need.
It replaces many many old and dilapidated pipes that actually do leak, constantly.
Sure, we can be upset about the tribalists who were supposedly being displaced, but I'm on Team America and Team Progress and Team Energy-Independence and Team Less-Pollution.
"First Nation" lost the war and we've been very generous for hundreds of years.
Still no proof, eh?
God damn you are an embarrassment to yourself.

I never thought he'd get very far but I would have liked to see him in at least one debate.
The topic at hand was how the DNC screwed Sanders and I wanted to make the point that he wasn't the only one.
Lessig did more to earn a podium spot than Chafee at the very least.
In hindsight he got into the race too late which allowed the DNC to shrug him off, but he had a salient point to make.

Haha.... you deleted your dumbass comment about me not being able to find an RT article to back my claim.
TDS much?

Fair enough.
[removed]
&gt;"facts"

What, a CNN poll?
I don't really know about anyone else since voting is supposed to be private.
All I'm saying is that contrary to your statement.
Some Bernie folks did vote for Trump for those very reasons.
I am one.
No reason to personally attack me and my insignificance.
The Dems lost the elections more then de GOP won it.
For a lot of people, the 2016 election was a rejection of the status quo more than anything, and Clinton was the ultimate representative of the status quo.
A lot of people supported Sanders *in opposition* to Clinton even if they didn't agree completely with the progressive agenda and a lot of people supported Trump *in opposition* to Clinton even if they didn't completely agree with the populist agenda.
whatabout.
Some did some did not.
I personally know several Sanders voters who voted Trump as a “fuck you” to the DNC.
In fact, I am married to one.
The funny part is if you bring that up to people on the left, a loft of them will pretend like the emails were a big conspiracy and in no way proved that they put Bernie at an unfair disadvantage.
Most of my friends were w Gary Johnson (was that his name?
I'm half asleep).
I actually watched the Libertarian debates.
I liked McAffee.
Ultimately though, living in CA who I voted for was irrelevant.
My vote for Bernie during the primaries was thwarted as the media called it for Hillary the day before the polls even opened!, and during the general election of course she took the state and all its electoral votes.
Many of us Greens didn't even see our vote counted on the election poll tallies.
Some counties where the Greens al knew each other had only a handful of votes for Stein.
It's an absolute farce (voting) they don't even his anymore.
I was pissed about the oligarchy in the debates, an attempt to manufacture consent and show only two choices.
The polls were appalling - called "scientific" and in the sense that n&gt;32 yeah they were, except they were "randomly" calling people on *fucking landlines* and who (even in my 40yo age group) even has a *landline* any more?!
Most polls CNN and Fox showed, if you look at the raw data, had no one under 30 participating.
Of course these polls were used to see who should be in debates, they were used to predict a Hillary win and they failed spectacularly, and they are *still* being used to try to manipulate and convince us they aren't anything but *manufactured*!
Such a lying shit show...!
[removed]
&gt;And youre criticizing him for this?
How "progressive" of you, vote for the woman and party that literally colluded to cheat bernie out of winning the primary via super delegates.
What a joke.
What's a joke is him voting for the candidate with his opposite policy preferences.
Sanders and Clinton policy preferences aligned 93%, Trump and Sanders are polar opposites on policy.
Sanders lost because he couldn't appeal to minorities.
It's pretty simple.
&gt;You voted for corruption just cause bernie endorsed her lol.
Bernie was a weak candidate and shoulda stood up and fought back, but we knew that from when his mic got taken from blm supporters.
No.
Corruption is voting for Trump.
I voted for Clinton.
Sanders said from the start he would endorse Clinton if he lost.
He was keeping his word.
&gt;Plenty of bernie bros i know voted for trump though due to what happened.
Its low life loser sheep  like you that voted for hillary even after they cheated bernie out of the primary.
So they voted for the candidate that was opposite their policy beliefs?
Got it.
Just because he lost doesn't mean she cheated, she got more votes, pretty simple.
Are you referencing the handful of Facebook ads some Russians bought?
Was it hard typing that with a straight face?
I did once I saw the corruption of the Democratic party.
I am an independent for reference.
Don’t you think it’s a mistake to label every obama voter a party loyalist?
He had crossover appeal as a candidate after bush, and was able to capture a large chunk of independents.
I’ll keep putting down corporate dems.
Blue no matter who doesn’t work and it needs to stop.
It's reckless and enables anyone with more money than the other guy to win.
Lol.
I never said that some Bernie folks *didn't* vote for Trump.
I take issue with the actual claim made that started this thread though and that remains relevant since it was a lie and made up.
Those lgbt buff Bernie memes though.
Swung the whole election!
Hillary never did nothing wrong lol.
/s

Right after the election it was “Trump is working for Putin” to keep attention off of the primary rigging.
Now that “Trump is working for Putin” has no factual basis.
Trump and his homie business men making probably corrupt business deals in Russia is the new Russia hysteria.
There’s still no good evidence of any Americans working against American interests to favor the Russian state.
CNN and MSNBC were way off and no one wants to hold them accountable.
Blue no matter who... puke.
You’re not fucking Americans.
You’re as immature as you were when you voted for prom queen and the retarded kid won.
Trump is our retarded kid.
I did not mean to say that every Obama voter was a party loyalist.
Obama was, however a "moderate" (pro-wealth lip service left) politician, with identity politics window dressing, much in the same way Clinton was.
So my meaning was that the same ratio of Obama voters crossing party lines demonstrated that it wasn't strictly progressive independents who jumped ship for Trump.
I can see how you'd infer that from how I phrased it though, apologies.
The problems with Clinton, and the Democratic party leadership generally, are far more broad than the "spolier" narrative being peddled by corporate-left apologists about Bernie.
The fact that Obama voters behaved in roughly the same way supports this assertion.
Edit: Clarity.
No, I didn't.
It still right up there.
Oh, one of the moderators removed it for rule 4.
How is it you missed that?
Did you really think I would remove my comment?
For what reason?
Lol.
As I said, you can't even find a crappy news site article to back up your claims and then...lol, and then you jump to another asinine assumption that I removed my comment?
Jeez man.
You gotta stop letting emotion guide your logic because it just leads to you being wrong all over the place.
Being emotional isn't really a problem, but you are like, sloppy and out of control emotional.

"Omg are you a misogynist?
Are you a bigot?

All the comments supporting my claim in this post are enough proof for you.
Stay delusional, what do I care?
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Have a nice day.
Shit man, I like McAffee as well!
I ultimately voted for Rand Paul in the primaries because I faced a lot of the concerns you had, knowing that any party outside of the top two can be seen as a wasted vote.
I mentioned Libertarianism because it's ultimately the only outside party that gathered any amount of steam, not because it's the only party that SHOULD but it does have a semi-conservative appeal to it (and with the nomination of Trump, the Libertarian party was a decent consideration for them).
I completely agree with the polls thing.
The media still wants a two party system and barely gives coverage to any party outside of red and blue.
Us libertarians were lucky to even have a debate, much less can be said about the green party sadly.
But I'd love both of these parties to experience better growth and actually add some sort of diversity to, like you said, this manufactured political field.
Great points man.
It was the most crooked election in history Tbh..
Both sides.. To a point its was obvious to anyone who isn't completely brainwashed by polarizing politics.
Trump and Hillary media coverage constant the entire time like no one else was evening running.
Hillary (a women) debating sanders..
Both democrats.. And every single debate was up against football be it on a Sunday or Thursday night.
Aka not many ppl outside of lifer democrats are gonna go out of their way to watch it.. Any undecided..
Independent voters were isolated many ways from those debates that sanders generally won..
Dnc leaks / whatshername Schultz fiascos made it clear the fix was in for Hillary.. Sanders wasn't given a fair shot at all by his "own" party who he himself knows is so fucked he only loosely associates himself with them..

All trump had to do was hold the media captive and that's what he does best.
He can scream fake news till he's blue in the face but without CNN etc he wouldn't have been elected.
Then you have trump basically tanking the whole time.
I'm sitting watching all this shit like..
This can't be fucking real.
From the pussy grabbing porn star fucking stuff..
To his wife basically reciting Michelle Obamas speech line for line..
I thought for sure that trump didn't want to be president and was trying to fuck up as many ways as he could and it's like anything he done good or bad just increased his popularity..
Honestly I dont see how anyone can look back on all that happened and not see how fucked up it all is..

For the record I am neither left nor right.. Democrat nor republican..
I hate all politicians equally because they are mainly all vampires that live off the backs of the evaporating middle class.
Sanders being one of the few that doesn't and the climate being the way it was he probably would have won had he beat Hillary..
But he was cheated out of a presidency for many reasons.
The benefit of the Middle class being the main one..
When I see democrats bitching about trump I'll often say how the fuck can you complain and still associate yourself with that party..
The DNC is more so responsible for trump winning the election than the Republicans imo.
They cheated for a candidate with a proven track record of being unelectable.
They figured since she would be against trump it might be the only chance she had of actually winning.. Wrong again.
There on fault.
Its all a shit show point blank period..
Still is..
Anyone that has any faith in the government period needs to wake the fuck up..  Trump might appear to be an outsider but he has been close to the Clinton family and others for years..
He is not a even a republican historically and fell into a gap where entertainment personalities appeal to stupid poor folks.
Sorry if it offends but the truth hurts.
All this shit is fake af.
And most of you all are still asleep..
Worse than that you think you know secret truths because you been lead in that direction by the puppet masters so you are comfortable in your blindness.
Thank you.
I couldn’t have put it so eloquently.
I made this meme in early ‘17, and I did exactly what you said.
The Florida election wasn’t the only time they did this, but it was the first pic that came up when I searched “empty Trump podium”, so that’s what I used.
This happened many times.
I’m positive they did this when he won Wisconsin, and was giving that victory speech.
At any rate, even if he was giving a concession speech during this particular screen grab, they still chose to air an empty Trump podium instead.
Dude no need arguing with them.
Anyone who thinks Trump is more corrupt than Hillary has been drinking too much Russia MSM Kool Aid.
What they did to Bernie was disgusting, and the DNC paid the price.
Now they're trying their damnest to twist every possible narrative in reach to do the same to Trump and his administration (not saying they're perfect, but he's doing a lot better than I expected him too)
Did you even read my comment?
My focus was on the fact that she lost because she was an awful politician, so awful that she couldn't beat someone largely considered (at least by the people whose vote she was courting) as a bigot and sexist.
[deleted]
Wow.
Yep.
You are way emotional.
So out of touch that can cant even tell difference between mocking and laughing at you and anger.
Jeez it must be hell for you to be so emotionally out of touch that you cant even identify emotions.
I pity you.
No wonder you are so wildly unhinged.
P.S.
the three people who said they were Bernie supporters who voted for Trump in this thread don't support your made up reality that millions did.
Lol.
I am so embarrassed for you.
Like, you exemplify why people make fun of conspiracy theorist.
You are completely missing the base logical skills to function in the world.
Maybe that's why you are emotionally falling apart and making up stories to soothe away all that deep knowledge and self hate of not being able to think your way out of a paper bag.
[deleted]
LOL

Keep REEEEing at me, very entertaining.
Referring to a meme as 'news' exacerbates the problem.
Makes people think it can be trusted.
That you are actually proud of the ridiculous and childish way your acting is sad.
Like, this is you at your best.
This is the absolute best you can achieve in life and you're actually proud of it.
Wow.
So embarrassed for you.
I voted for stein.
That was who I liked the most out of who was left.
Fuck being strategic.
Her party rigged the primaries against the only other choice of the dem voters.
She valled voters deplorables and literally had  emails saying she wanted open borders and a lot of things different from her platform.
and a laundry list of criminal activity followed her.
Trump saying "you'd be in prison" got the loudest on TV applause.
She lost that night.
No.
I'm referring to the indictments, the intelligence community, and other investigations.
&gt; He wasn’t even competitive in the South

You mean the red states that would have gone Trump anyway in the general election?
&gt; his best states were ones designed to have lower turnout (caucus states)

His best states were the ones that had the least capacity for electoral interference by entrenched power, the states with the least purging of voter polls and other suppression, and the states where people had to actually talk to their neighbors to make a decision.
&gt; we’re all forgetting how much of a battle he had to fight to even compete with Hillary

We endured unprecedented election fraud including a complete mismatch between exit polls and results, and a high correlation between riggable voting and Hillary wins.
We suffered press collusion and a media blackout which gave Clinton a 10x advantage in critical early coverage.
We watched party leadership scheming including debate scheduling shenanigans and stacking the deck for lobbyists, we weathered assaults from a rabid network of surrogates, and witnessed the creation of a state party extortion racket to service her.
We withstood trolls paid by Hillary-coordinated SuperPACs infiltrating our social media, and had child porn posted by our opponents to get our organizing groups shut down.
Yes, I agree, it was a grueling uphill battle.
The implication you're making, by omitting all of the underhanded things she and her lackeys did, is that it was a fair battle.
It was not.
At the time, I was told by people like you that she'd bring that same cutthroat approach to taking down Trump.
How'd that work out for you?
Though there is a lot of data to support this claim, sure, we can't say for certain that Bernie would have won.
You know what we do know for certain?
Clinton couldn't even beat Tangerine Mussolini.
i dont think this is so true.
He wasn’t competitive in the South because he wasn’t popular with black voters.
Also, people “like me” didn’t tell you anything.

Bernie voters most important issue was TPP, at least the well informed ones.
Trump was against TPP.
Many Bernie voters voted for Trump to stop TPP.
And they also felt it would be better to have a real progressive candidate in 2020 than have a wall street hooker like Hillary win.
Look at the last paragraph here http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/11/debunking_myths_about_trump_voters_with_exit_polls.html 23% of voters who wanted the next president to have more liberal policies than Obama did, voted for Trump.
That's a good chunk of the Bernie crowd.
Do you know the time frame that the crimes in the indictments takes place?
Seems like it was before he was even working for Drumph.
&amp;#x200B;

You're not citing the 17 "intellignece' communities that were pushed by John Molesta and Co. around the elction are you?
Lol if so

&amp;#x200B;

Other investigations?
Like Operation Fast and Furious or the Steele dosier?
&amp;#x200B;
[Bernie was actually more popular with Blacks than Clinton](https://resistancereport.com/politics/harvard-poll-bernie-supporters/).
I understand why you would have that perception, it was repeated over and over by the media, but the data does not support your statement.
&gt; She valled voters deplorables 

First of all, half of Trump voters.
Second... was she wrong?
Trump advocated multiple war crimes when he was running for candidate, why wouldn't those supporting him either be deplorable or incredibly ignorant?
because you don't attack any voters are who high electoral college states before the election.
That was stupid.
Those rallies were in heavy swing states.
She should have gone there and said 'don't believe this millionaire con man, I'm here to help you' she didn't even show up.
Pathetic.
Trump on the other hand, pretended to be Christian, and sold himself( a New Yorker born millionaire) as a peoples every day working man.
What a con man.
Americans would believe anything as long you sell them a dream not insults and " it's her turn'
Nobody's contesting that it's a stupid thing to say politically speaking.
You literally responded to a comment saying "she was an awful politician".
I'm just saying that, while stupid to say, it's still accurate.
Trump voters are gullible yes but not deplorable enough to elect the woman making fun of them.
i was trying to do mocking sarcasm.
even if they are more ignorant, or poor, or even mentally challenged, you still treat them with kindness and respect in a political setting.
You dont go out there and insult them during an election.
It made people who wouldnt vote, vote against her.
Your link doesn’t actually say that.
And it doesn’t mention Clinton’s numbers with black voters.
It just says that 73 percent of blacks like Bernie.
It doesn’t give any info for Clinton.
So I’m not sure how you can make the claim that he was more popular than her with black voters.
Butthurt Hillary Voters are the best.
This is fake as hell, and the kicker is, this actually happened to HRC and now slimy wingnuts are trying to appropriate her victimhood for their own causes.
Lol, your ability to project your own inadequacies is rather fascinating

So far you've proven to be a close minded, emotional, illogical child who delights in his own virtue signaling while attacking people on reddit for fun.
Smells like a leftist college student LOL

Kavanaugh will be confirmed

Republicans will retain House and Senate through the midterms

Trump wins 2020

Ginsburg will die/resign

Trump appoints a 3rd SJC.
You sound just like DJT.
Your more like the man you hate, then you can admit.
*you're
*than
*unnecessary comma

Three English mistakes in less than 140 characters, but *I'm* the one like Trump.
Right.
See, you seem to forget that people are individuals and don't fall exactly on the right or left of the spectrum.
Just because I supported Bernie doesn't make me a democrat, just like me voting for trump doesn't make me a republican.
It means that I, as an individual, looked at what I value and made a decision.
How progressive of you to try to shit on me exercising my personal freedoms.
fucking bigots.
They didn't have a chance at winning.
A Clinton win means 4-8 years of a Corrupt politician who said it was "her turn", like she's fucking entitled to it.
A Trump win most likely means 4 years of Trump followed up but a popular progressive candidate like Bernie Sanders if the DNC doesn't pull the same stunt or 8 years of Trump if they pull that stunt again.
So guaranteed 8 years of a shitty president or possible 4 years of a crappy one.
And honestly for as much as Trump has people bitching about his every decision he's done one great thing for the country.
The states are starting to stand for themselves instead of relying on the federal government.
Trump says global warming doesn't exist and suddenly every state legislature is tripping over bills supporting renewable energy in a way and time frame that makes sense for their state.
My own state has had hundreds of small solar farms and probably 100-150 wind turbines put up in the past two years.
Even my little home town of 500 people has a 15 acre solar farm on the edge of town.
The town of 3k just down the road has a hydro plant, 20 acre solar farm, and are putting up 8 wind turbines.
The entire town will be powered by renewable energy with excess power being used by neighboring towns.
That's progress.
States are debating and passing state level net neutrality laws.
More US citizens are politically active than every before in our history.
The talk of the trade wars is debatable but here's a question.
Can US businesses build more factories to make products domestically?
Yup, our economy use to be a manufacturing based economy decades ago.
Can Chinese companies suddenly start growing more crops considering their limited amount of arable land and huge population in response to tariffs.
Not likely.
You know I’ve often thought about all of that whenever there was a reaction to something Trump did.
He’s basically taken the behind the scenes corruption and started doing it in the open so everyone can see it, it would be admirable if so many people suddenly stopped seeing his acts as corrupt.
It’s 50/50 on whether, going forward, he normalises corruption and it gets worse or he makes the people more intent on removing corruption.
The actions of the Republican Party and voters and the previous behaviour of the Democratic Party makes me think it’s going to be the former because they all benefit from that corruption and if the dems no longer have to hide it for fear of Republican hypocrisy destroying their credibility then they’re not going to change a thing.
I'm calling you out because you voted for Sanders whose policy platform involves imposing stricter regulations on Wall Street, saving the ACA and promoting the concept of Medicare for All, and other more progressive things.
Trump is literally the opposite of those platforms.
So yeah, call me suspicious for calling you out for voting your literal opposite policy preferences.
Wanna hear a secret?
I really don't care if you believe me.
Look at my post history.
I was active on sandersforpresident and minnesota4sanders.
Should be obvious that I was a sanders supporter and now I'm telling you that I voted Trump.
Lesser of two evils man.
So you support Sanders proposal but opposed it when he called out Trump You aren't a progressive.
Got it.

Summary: 
I voted for Trump in the general.
Corruption is voting for Trump.
I am so embarrassed for you.
Trump is not a Republican...hello.
Many Bernie people voted Trump.
Trump is the antithesis of Sanders.
Sanders voters did NOT vote for Trump.
That was who I liked the most out of who was left.
Like, this is you at your best.
I am an independent for reference.
Why did it have to be Trump though?
Except most Sanders supporters voted for Clinton.
Trump is our retarded kid.
Some Bernie folks did vote for Trump for those very reasons.
Many Bernie voters voted for Trump to stop TPP.
I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
I never said that some Bernie folks *didn't* vote for Trump.
I did once I saw the corruption of the Democratic party.
Likewise, millions of people who voted for Sanders in the primary, voted for Trump.
No, I just used the wrong term.
I stand by every word.
1 in 10 Berners voted for Trump.
Trump is literally the opposite of those platforms.
I don’t know a single Sanders supporter who ended up voting for Trump.
I really don't care if you believe me.
I actually watched the Libertarian debates.
I couldn’t have put it so eloquently.
I completely agree with the polls thing.
Shit man, I like McAffee as well!
It made people who wouldnt vote, vote against her.
Should be obvious that I was a sanders supporter and now I'm telling you that I voted Trump.
In fact, I am married to one.
I voted Sanders primary and Trump in General, get the fuck outta here with your denial.
Makes people think it can be trusted.
Deny it all you want but millions of people who voted for Obama, voted for Trump.
I did not mean to say that every Obama voter was a party loyalist.
Did you really think I would remove my comment?
You think it inconceivable that 2% of Trump voters also voted for Bernie in the primary?
I was active on sandersforpresident and minnesota4sanders.
Hillary (a women) debating sanders..
Butthurt Hillary Voters are the best.
Stay delusional, what do I care?
I knew all about that pipeline and I supported its construction...
I don't think I'll ever vote Democrat again, they are as corrupt as the Republicans.
I think you should post a screenshot on r/politics.
MILLIONS of Sanders voters ended up voting Trump once they realized how fucking corrupt the DNC and Clintons are.
I personally know several Sanders voters who voted Trump as a “fuck you” to the DNC.
You do not know what you are talking about.
She lost, not because of Sanders voters, but because of super delegates.
You need to get out more then.
It still right up there.
Seems like it was before he was even working for Drumph.
A nearly identical ratio of Obama voters voted for Trump.
Just because I supported Bernie doesn't make me a democrat, just like me voting for trump doesn't make me a republican.
You don't represent millions of people who did as you did.
Simple:

She won the popular vote because Sanders voters did infact, vote for her.
I think that the FLA at the bottom is a ticker.
There were far more Obama voters than Bernie primary voters.
You sound just like DJT.
Ultimately though, living in CA who I voted for was irrelevant.
The Clinton camp and DNC had no one to blame but themselves.
The DNC is more so responsible for trump winning the election than the Republicans imo.
Furthermore, his beliefs and voting base are "Democrats".
Sanders said from the start he would endorse Clinton if he lost.
It's an absolute farce (voting) they don't even his anymore.
So they voted for the candidate that was opposite their policy beliefs?
This was disproved when the Clinton camp tried to blame Bernie for trump.
&gt;You voted for corruption just cause bernie endorsed her lol.
This is one reason Hillary won the popular vote - the actual voters ended up voting for her.
&gt;Plenty of bernie bros i know voted for trump though due to what happened.
It just says that 73 percent of blacks like Bernie.
I thought it was possible that Bernie could have won another state that same day.
You dont go out there and insult them during an election.
i dont think this is so true.
However, I looked at all the primaries on March 15 and they were all won by Hillary.
And far more butthurt Hillary voters voted for McCain in 2008 than Bernie voters for Trump.
So even after Sanders endorsed Clinton and Trump pursued opposite policies then Sanders you still voted for Trump?
