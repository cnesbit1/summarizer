It appears that pre-0.15 version nodes would've caught the attempted inflation and would reject the block.
So I think it's good to have older versions co-exist with newer ones.

Not to mention alternative clients.
Avid fan of btcd!
Btcd slavishly copied bitcoin's code, reimplementing bugs along the way.
I would bet pretty much any amount of money that if it had been built later-- after this issue was introduced-- it simply would have copied the behavior.
Not that this is a bad way to do things: it makes it more likely to be compatible.
For a consensus system being "fixed" creates weakness, not strength, because consistency is almost always more important than correctness.
And they say soft forking is bad :P.

In my mind this is why backwards compatibility is a must.

I wish the alert flag was still around, because upgrade notices could be posted this way.
I suppose other channels to communicate it are effective, but nothing beats a "HEY UPGRADE" right on the client.
There shall be no authoritative voice in Bitcoin!!

Maybe such could be re-introduced, as a warning-filled opt-in feature requiring multiple signatures from Core devs.
On the other hand, information about the urgency of fixing the bug / updating seems to be spreading fine.
