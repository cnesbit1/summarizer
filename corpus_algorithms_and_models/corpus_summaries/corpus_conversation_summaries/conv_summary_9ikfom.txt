As the idea, that's amazing.
But the fees, man.
The fees are not worth paying for it.
We're still 10-20 years back until the ATMs will have decent fees - not more than 2%.
I mean I paid about a 6% fee so that’s still not TOO BAD.
For a Tier 1 country, no.
For a worldwide adoption, yes.
If its 6% in USA/Canada its probably 10% in a East European one and around 15-20% in African countries.
Well I can’t do quick math apparently.
It was 8.75%
That’s if you don’t include the 10% markup on market value.
It doesn't look like there was any additional fee, it's just the market spread.
He put in $20, paid $7286.93/BTC, and got 0.00274464.
That $7286.93 looks like the "out the door price" of his bitcoin.
At at 2pm Eastern (when he did the transaction) price was around $6650 on Coinbase, so that's more like 9.5% markup.

and approximately 12% above market value.
nice.
i am now on coinbase, but we have one of these machines in my town.
you put in 100 dollars usd cash - and get around 40$ in btc.
i'm a total noob to all this, but that seems *too* steep.
It wasn’t a fee on top of the markup.
The markup is the fee.
Either way, that's terrible.
I have a 2% fee from bitcoin ATMs in EE, displayed as markup.
And a 0.40€ transaction fee.
Not bad to be honest, there's an atm on every metro station.
The trick is, the atm's are used for everything form bills to steam, to btc exchanges.
I'd like some other crypto options as well but it seems it's not going to happen soon.
To each his own.
I bought through this route for the novelty of buying through an ATM.

Summary: 
The markup is the fee.
The fees are not worth paying for it.
It wasn’t a fee on top of the markup.
And a 0.40€ transaction fee.
