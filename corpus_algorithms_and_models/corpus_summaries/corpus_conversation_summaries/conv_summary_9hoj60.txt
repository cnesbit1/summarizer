Original Response: 
I'm not an economist, but I don't think it takes a genius or a degree to look at the supply of sigils...that you can't craft and have limited supply, and realize that hey maybe there aren't enough to go around for the entire playerbase.
The same thing happened with [drooburt last year during](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7wjajg/drooburt_can_starve_this_year_for_all_i_care/) wintersday.
Whoever is in charge of the economy at anet really needs to get their shit together.
Sigils of nullification are going for 13g right now.
Edit: I'd just like to clarify why I don't like what happened here.
I don't think anyone here would be upset if you needed say amalgamated gemstones instead of the sigils or even just flat gold.
I don't mind coughing up materials/gold for shinies, especially shinies that look as good as the new armor set.
I mind that there is no way to realistically obtain the items you need outside of the TP.
This has happened twice now and this is an even worse situation since at least there was a somewhat OK supply of the dumplings coming from the event itself.
Even if they don't have an economist right now that's no excuse not to fix this.
Just add a damn recipe for that sigil that keep the price stable and not stupidly inflated, hate having my progress Nullified after farming all that damn mistonium

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: forgot to clarify that I wouldn't actually mind a 100g or more sink for this Requiem collection as long as it were made stable by a sigil recipe with materials that are in steady supply... but requiring 25 of a previously worthless item that is also not exactly "farmable" and thus has a very volatile price point is NOT the way to implement a gold sink.

i see what you did there.
IDK do I downvote or upvote...
Upvoted for kickass pun.
Upvote... but he's on thin ice!

This all reminds me again of HoT and guild halls where we needed large saddlebags which, with HOT were no longer available.
Afaik is it possible to "mystic forge" them.
4 rare sigils should give you one random exotic sigil.

yeah, just roll a chance for it along with almost 100 equally likely sigils.
that's quick.
and 4 rares doesn't always equal an exotic.
True, it is not a very comfortable way to "craft" them.
But if the sigil gets too expensive players will use this way to forge these sigils.
Same as I also don't craft infusions - too much hassle.
If you are lazy and want the item now you always pay a premium.
Or just use icy runestones since those clearly already exist to be a pure gold sink.

Sigil of Nullification recipe leak:

100 Mystic Coi...
To defuse that Mystic Coin bomb, I'd like to take the opportunity to remind everyone that crafting professions are still a thing, so how about this:

Superior Sigil of Nullification (On Critical Hit: 60% chance of Boon removal)  
1 Orichalcum Ingot  
1 Glob of Ectoplasm  
1 Corrupted Lodestone  
1 Evergreen Lodestone

Available for Huntsman, Weaponsmith and Artificer.
The current material price is between 1g - 2g but the real advantage is to have an additional way of obtaining important sigils/runes.
I'd also like it, if we had a way to craft [Soldier's Intricate Gossamer Insignias](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soldier%27s_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia) and [Soldier's Orichalcum Imbued Inscriptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Soldier%27s_Orichalcum_Imbued_Inscription) to be craftable.
I'm not even sure, if the components would be cheaper or more expensive, but at least you have higher security, as the current tiny supply could dry up immediately as a result of speculation.
Fyi, something choosing gold =/= gold sink.
Imho anet actually does a fairly decent job with gold sinks.
Tons of stuff is only available by purchasing it via an npc.
Things like thread, and cooking shit, and exchanging non gold currencies(these are only sometimes gold sinks) are all excellent gold sinks.
Much better than something like armor repair, or a "must use" consumable.
Tldr: irrelevant comment about probably one of the most interesting(imo) aspects of mmos.

Doesn't it require 40?

Summary: 
True, it is not a very comfortable way to "craft" them.
Sigils of nullification are going for 13g right now.
