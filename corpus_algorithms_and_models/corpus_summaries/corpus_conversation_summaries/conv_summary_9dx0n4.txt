Original Response: 
Alright.
I saw the story about the handcuffs so I thought I would tell my story.
So both my girlfriend and I are deaf.
Well, partially deaf.
We both met in a special school and have been dating for about 5 years, in case you were wondering how deaf people met.
What is also special about our relationship is that she is from France and I'm American--so there is also a language barrier added to our dynamic.
Sometimes, she will go visit her family in France.
And when she comes back, there is often a sexfest that occurs.
It was great in college, its great as a young adult.
We usually keep it tame but I have always told my neighbors that if we are loud for any reason, to just ring the doorbell.
I also don't know if people know this but instead of having an audible noise from our doorbell, the light flickers.
Its the day that she is coming home and I'm excited.
Everything is set up, candles, romantic shit.
Events are partaking, everything is going great but then we start incorporating some interesting shit.
We would usually do shower stuff, flexible position shit or food stuff (don't ask).
But this time, we were doing BDSM shit.
There was some yelling, some moaning.
Some answering the door partially naked and hoping the Postmates guy wouldn't be judgemental (even though they always are).
She puts on a facemask and handcuffs me to the bed.
Which in hindsight, is pretty weird shit for people who cannot hear very well.
But I was down.
She lifts the eye mask and says she'll be right back.
So I'm just chilling blindfolded, handcuffed and rocking a boner.
Pretty sure there is a Wedding Crashers scene about my situation.
A couple of minutes goes by and she hasn't come back yet.
*Was she finally going to do the special cosplay we talked about?
Was she on the toilet.
Was she eating?
* A lot of thoughts.
A couple more minutes goes by and now I'm a little bit worried.
Excited, but nervous.
I start calling her name and don't get any response....
I start to try to wiggle my way out of the handcuffs but it doesn't work.
I'm just waiting for some type of reaction and hopefully that everything is alright.
I begin to feel the ground shaking, which sounded like footsteps and I thought, *Another person?
Fuck yeah.
* So now I'm back to a stiffy.
Suddenly, the blindfold lifts and there are four police offers starting at me.
This is the fucked up thing, my fantasy was police officer sex.
I thought she was playing into it because she was still naked.
The officers aren't really saying anything, there are three cute female officers and a young looking male officer.
We had done swinger parties in the past so I wasn't surprised by anything that was going on.
Its not been a solid 30 seconds and nothing has happened.
Just a staring fest.
They begin to speak but I cannot understand.
I now know that shit is going on and ask to be removed from the handcuffs and now put on some pants.
I tell them our story and they slowly begin to understand.
There now writing things down and tell us that they were doing a well-being check for our neighbor and heard us.
They knocked on the door but now they get why they couldn't hear us.
(Normally, they would know if we were hearing impaired through a bio they would have but since they weren't searching for us in the beginning, they wouldn't know what was going on).
I proceed to walk out of the room and see the damage, including a busted down door, four of our neighbors on the floor peaking into our condo and a cake on the floor.
So TL;DR Had rough sex, am deaf, cops heard it, we couldn't.
So instead of ringing the doorbell they instantly kicked the door open?

Protocol for cops is to knock afaik, as not every doorbell works and you certainly can’t always hear it from the outside to be sure.
Downvote me all you want - but there is literally a reason why cops don’t use the doorbell.
that's just plain stupid, they should use the doorbell and knock.
Name one situation other than this that a doorbell is necessary?
i'm often working in the basement for hours so obviously i don't hear if someone's knocking on the front door.
most times i'm in my room on the second level playing video games with a headset on.
i sure as hell won't hear if someone's knocking on the front door.
but in both cases, i heard the loud doorbell.
basically, 80% of the time i won't hear you knocking.
Have you ever seen a cop ring a doorbell?
Everyone I've ever seen working (was a paramedic) is a much bigger fan of the angry side fist punch/knock on the door -pound pound pound- police!
Open up!
Also doorbells are just a electronic switch.
Someone if inclined could wire it to something else other than of the bell.
Which is a fair point, and I suspect, a factor in why it seems they're trained not to use them.
IANAC, but I'd suspect it has less to do with the extremely low likelihood of the doorbell being booby trapped and mostly to do with the fact that doorbells are very ignorable and not urgent (think car alarms).
Thunderous hammering on the door indicates "I am not here to discuss our lord and savior Jesus Christ, but rather because there is some shit that requires your personal attention right effin now."
Oh absolutely.
I should have said a small factor.
If someone really wanted a trip safety their eventual knocking the door in could easily be rigged to set that off as well.
And yeah the power of a knock is a lot harder to ignore.
Have to agree with you here, my room is pretty close to the front door, and evem then I can hear the doorbell much better than knocking.
Are you sitting in front of your door all the time?
Because most people aren't sitting near their door.
Cops are simultaneously too dumb and untrained to be worried about this but also constantly terrified for their lives to the point where they shoot unarmed people when the cops show up to the wrong address on the reg, so I would disagree with your assertion that the cops are rightfully concerned here.
Depressing meta.
I’ve always gotten a gentle knock.
Although, to be fair, I was always either the person who called them, or they were asking me for information about others, I was never the direct target.
Yeah, I live in an interesting neighborhood.
Up front, not condoning the door kick, but I'm assuming they entered under an exigent circumstances exclusion to the 4th amendment, in which case, yes they can kick the door open.
More likely, they got reports of, or heard what sounded like a struggle, knocked, got no response as OP and GF are deaf, deemed the sounds as reasonable suspicion there was criminal activity, and booted the door in.
Otherwise they would need a search/arrest warrant, and are required to knock and announce and wait a short amount of time before the silence can be inferred as a denial to entry (again, need a legal warrant for this)
Thinking the minority is the majority.
You're very smart.
It's a minority that literally murders civilians, but it's the majority that covers for them.
Any cop defending a bad cop is also a bad cop.
If an entire police department defends a bad cop, that entire precinct is nothing but bad cops.
Not a cop but a pizza delivery guy.
Half of people's doorbells don't work but if it does you can't always hear it, so you can't tell from the outside if it worked or not.
To avoid waiting a few minutes for no reason it's much easier to just knock.
Same here, our "front door" is right in front of a two level split.
So when you walk in the front door you immediately go downstairs or upstairs.
Our main computer room, and we're both gamers, is upstairs down the hall, opposite corner from the door.
We play with headphones on when we're playing other games, the door is usually closed so the cats don't chew the cords, we have a huge standing window AC between us to not die in the heat, our puppy is in that room with us bouncing around, our chinese water dragon terrarium is in there with two running (loud) water fountains...

And we have 4 cats and another 50 lb dog.
Our cats know how to open cupboard doors.
Our big dog is clumsy.
We're right next to a busy street (room window over looks yard, fence is against major road).
The amount of times I've either thought someone was breaking in, or ignored tons of thumping and pounding, due to just general house noise from the pets when they play their favorite game (which I have dubbed thundering herd of elephants) is too damn high LOL.

I'm with the other response you got - sometimes you just can't hear someone knocking.

I work delivery.
If I had to guess, I'd say at least 30% of the doorbells I push while on the clock don't work.
Knocking always makes noise.
Especially if they have a dog.
It's the people in charge who defend the very few asshole cops.
It's a part of being in power: they're corrupt.
The little cops don't have a say in what their station does, they're just expected to do their jobs.
"I am the one who knocks."
I see a bunch of replies saying it's because people ignore it, to indicate urgency, or you don't know when the doorbell doesn't work so it's better to just knock first...

Why not knock and ring at the same time?
I cannot hear a knock at my door from the majority of my house.
I honestly can only hear it from the first  room the hall connects too and no further.
It's worse when I have my laundry machine or dish washer running.
However my door bell can be heard from anywhere.
The little cops can absolutely blow the whistle.
The little cops absolutely cover for their partners, for their squads.
The little cops absolutely lie to Internal Affairs.
The little cops absolutely ignore or write off unnecessary violence and abuse as "well the guy deserved it."
It's not a few bad apples and a bunch of great apples.
It's a few bad apples and a bunch of apples that are happy to rot right next to them rather than throwing out the bad ones.
So true.
Every time I hear somebody pound on the door, my stomach drops to my asshole because I think it's the police.
It’s not exactly a friendly knock, it’s more of a closed fist hammer from my experience and typically followed by a police department/sheriffs office/whatever.
This guy lives in cheesey movies.
There's a surprising number of people that completely ignore doorbells and just knock.
I get that you think the doorbell might not be working, but you could try *both*.
Or just do both at the same time.
I can hear my doorbell fine anywhere in the house but if you only knock there's a very good chance I won't hear it.
Someone could also wire a simple vibration sensor to the door and make things go boom when someone knocks on it?
Especially if you know that cops will always smash the door instead of ringing?
Doesn't require that much more effort.
Edit: I am an idiot for not reading comments further down.
Please ignore.
Agree.
It’s odd they wouldn’t do both.
When I’m upstairs I can’t hear knocking, even serious pounding, on the front door - whereas the door bell can be heard anywhere.
I had to call 911 three times in the past several years and all three times they actually *did* ring the bell and knock.
It probably just depends on the officers and situation.
Such things already exist.
Really?
I'd never hear knocking from my room but I'd definitely hear a doorbell.
Youve never seen the doorbell in my apartment.
I always get a heart attack when this thing is pressed.
Probably already lost 10 years of my life through this.
If you dont know where to knock, I wont hear you in my house (mothers house).
Because the door is on another floor and cut off by thick walls.
Ah the good ole door bell booby trap, what a classic.
My grandmas house is very old.
Think 2 inches of shiplock.
She won't hear you knock.
That alarm though, the neighbors hear it.
How fucking big is your house?
I don't have a big house but a townhouse.
If you're knocking on the 1st floor I won't hear it from the 3rd.
And if it's not a police knock, I won't hear it on the 2nd floor either.
You're right on the door opening trap, for sure.
And God help those cops if they're at one of Macauley Culkin's  doors...they won't fare well with any level of training (😁😁)
Lol, it's like the convenience store near me, it has a bell that rings for a full 5 seconds every time someone opens the front door after like, 11 PM.
And I'm talking like, old school high school bell that's uncomfortably loud from across the store.
I pity those people.
😁.
That's why I always booby trap the welcome mat.
I have closed doors and headphones on almost all the time.
Well, in this case nobody would hear the doorbell.
A deaf person's doorbell is a light.
The reason that the cops didn't use the doorbell was probably because they didn't notice it due to the fact that usually, when somebody has hearing impairment and has a special doorbell, they will put up a sign directing you to ring the doorbell instead of knocking.
I don't understand why they wouldn't try both before knocking the door in, but I imagine they were just hurried and didn't notice the doorbell.
They know you're smoking THE POTS!!!!
!
What are you even talking about?
They can force entry if they're on a well-being check and nobody answers.
It's pretty much at that officer's discretion.
Sometimes they will also call EMS as well if any details in the situation make them quite sure that they will need medical assistance.
The reason they were allowed to force entry is because it was a wellness check.
I have been in situations plenty of times where the cops use the doorbell.
I don't know why you seem to think that there's some sort of protocol that requires them to not use a doorbell, but that's ridiculous.
I would imagine the reason that they didn't use the doorbell is that they probably didn't notice it and they were in a hurry because they might have thought somebody was hurt.
Anytime the cops have come to my place they knock and ring the bell at the same time.
It probably just depends on how visible the button for the doorbell is and if they think to look for one.
If they are in a big hurry because they think somebody might really be seriously hurt, they might be less likely to check for the doorbell and just force the door.
There isn't any protocol that they aren't supposed to ring the doorbell or that they never do.
Maybe that's what's happened in your experience, but I don't think that's any kind of rules set in stone.
In pizzas people get pissy if you knock out ring more than once and that affects your tips.
Imagine if Jehovah's Witnesses pounded on your door like a SWAT team.
Hence the afaik.
I am not a cop.
Whether or not there IS protocol, the fact of the matter is that they knock more often than not - and obviously there is a reason for that, where you or I know the reason or not.
A quick google search of the question came up with this account from a retired officer
https://www.quora.com/Why-do-police-often-knock-instead-of-using-the-doorbell

Either way, the fact that we are having a conversation about cops knocking rather than using a door bell goes to show that it is a very common occurrence.
To say that you have a lot of experience with cops ringing the bell rather than knocking tells me one of two things: 1.
You are lying out or ass for the sake of being a contrarian OR 2.
There is a reason why the cops frequent you residence....
Even though this is the internet, fuller of number one-ers, I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it’s number two.
But why are you visited by the cops so much?
I live in an apartment building, you've heard of those?
Means that I have a lot of experience talking to Cops about my neighbors.
I have a couple of neighbors that are heavy Drinkers and the cops have been here multiple times.
I didn't say they had been here every single day or more than 10 times.
Just that I have had multiple experiences with this particular thing.
When the cops want to ask me about a situation that occurred in my apartment complex or anything like that, they usually ring the Bell while knocking.
I assume that they are just trying to convey urgency to me and trying to get as much information as possible and get the hell out of here.
You're making a lot of negative assumptions about me based on the fact that police have been to my residence.
It's quite common for Neighbors to be asked about any noise they might have heard to aid in the investigation if there is a domestic assault reported.
But I must be lying out of my ass or I deserve for the cops to be at my house all the time, right?
I can't control what my neighbors do, I just try not to bother anybody and live my life.
Ok wow, lol get the stick out of your ass friend.
I’ve lived in apartments nearly all of my life but have never once opened my door to a cop.
In any case I made no assumption about you, let alone a negative one.
Though the assumption I did make was that the cops had a reason to show up to your residence... and I was right apparently.
Either way your toxic explosion of rage just makes me believe you even less, so I’m thinking you’re another internet asshole that makes shit up to “prove” himself right about his baseless opinions.
Toxic explosion of rage?
You basically implied that I must be doing something to make the police come to my house all the time and straight-up said that I was probably lying.
My reply was extremely mild.
Just because mention that you make negative assumptions about me doesn't mean that I'm in a rage.
I've had a lot of things in my ass, I've never tried an actual stick though.
You want to have a meet up sometime?
You could bring the stick.
Only if you bring the donuts.
I make lovely donuts, so sure.
Also *herself*
My mistake.
&gt;So both my girlfriend and I are deaf.
&gt;I start calling her name and don't get any response....

Well...uh...*yeah*...  :D.
I think he said one of them is partially deaf, so I'm assuming it's the grill.
Yeah, my grill can’t hear for shit either.
I keep asking it if the coals are hot, and it never responds.
Ya.
That grill hears for both of them.
Sorry, couldn’t resist.
[removed]
I feel for you man, mine is the same.
But at least my grill's hot.
r/nothingeverhappens.
I think my grill is hot all the time, but I'm afraid to open up and tell her how I feel.
He was signing as loud as he could.
beat me to it.
The three cute female officer part makes me question this.
[deleted]
And then there's me, still in the mine.
Mine just screams nonstop.
Ha.
Ha.
Ha.
You're lucky, my grill just roasts everything near it and smokes a lot.
Mine only does that when I light ~~her~~ it on fire.
And the screaming stops after a few minutes.
Do you not have female cops where you live or.
Yeah, of course there are.
But what are the chances that 75% of the officers that came to his room are cute females?
The cherry on top is that he gets his rocks off to that.
Just sounds fishy to me.
[removed]
Sometimes I don't open the top and mine blows up in my face.
You need to enjoy life more.
You need to be less gullible.
Not sure how this relates but I do plenty.
Maybe try not to assess how people live based on a comment?
Hey it's me, ur grill.

For a welfare check they may have sent women specifically depending on the situation.
Have you ever *seen* a female cop or.
I called the police in January for a public safety incident and at least three of the police that turned up were women even though it was a situation that would need forceful removal of a person.
All it takes for three female cops to come is an all female partnership + a male and female partnership, both of which are not necessarily uncommon or unheard of, at least in the UK police.
Also I think quite a few people in the world would consider the majority of female cops cute by nature.
Not saying the story is true though!
My grill has gas and gets hot when I turn the knob.
*coals*

That was your first mistake.
Allow me to tell you about the wonders of clean burning propane.
Taste the meat, not the heat.
Your grill has a knob?
The deafness doesn't have to be *total* (just severe enough the sense is not especially useful).
But deaf people can call for attention in other ways, such as stomping feet or slamming walls, as this can be felt a reasonable distance.
No way.
It adds a delicious smokey flavor.
Hardwood pellets are preferable, but more difficult.
I wanna be in the screenshot.
That was my thinking too.
He was signing IN ALL CAPS, FFS!
Had a hot postwoman for a while, she was amazon prime!
Me too.
Traps are not Gay.
Yeah!
I love seeing some greased up spatula on spatula action!
He said they are both hearing impaired.
That doesn't mean deaf, that means hearing is impaired.
He even clarified in his story that they aren't completely deaf.

"
my girlfriend and I are deaf.
Well, partially deaf."
He literally said it in the next sentence.
Did they say something that implied that they don't enjoy life?
I'm extremely confused at what this comment is about.
I'm sorry to see that you didn't get the joke.
I'm sorry to see that you didn't get the joke.
I'm saying that the joke doesn't work if they aren't completely deaf.
So do the police pay for repairs or what?
No, but they do seize all the cash you have and keep it without charging you for anything.
As America should be /s.
I'm not sure if you're joking...
The police bust down your door without even ringing the doorbell, they take your cash, and don't reimburse the door.
That's literal robbery.

That's pretty much the status quo for America.
At least in the bigger cities, and in the poorer neighborhoods.
[deleted]
[deleted]
no it wouldn’t.
Real answer: yes they usually do if it’s a situation like this.
Based off stories I’ve seen they may “forget” to actually send you the check after you show them the bill for the repair cost and you gotta pester them but they pay eventually.
Also, OP commented and confirmed they paid for the door.
He is either joking or one of those anti-cop people.
The police usually reimburses you for damages if they mess up.
According to OP he already received his check from the police department.
They might not reimburse them for the door, but seizing the money was probably a joke.
However, there *was* a story recently about a couple who had somewhere in the area of 10k seized, but weren't charged with anything.
Welcome to America.
Thanks for giving the underlying reason.
This law gives incentive for police to take money.
Seems like:

1.
The police should be liable for misjudgment

2.
Money should *never* go directly to police.
Police should hand it to the state, who redistributes it.
