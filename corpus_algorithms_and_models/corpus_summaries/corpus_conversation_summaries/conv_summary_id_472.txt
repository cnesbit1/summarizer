Original Response: 
My car makes a little cricket noise whenever I use gasoline that contains ethanol, just thought I'd ask.
Rudy's off Airline and SPID, and the boat docks on the island.
Awesome!
Thanks Beta.
hmm.. cricket noise... You wouldn't happen to have a BRZ or FR-S?
Lol, I sure do!
FRS to be exact!
haha!
I have a BRZ with 14K miles and experience the same thing.
The car literally sounds like crickets and that's how everyone describes it online.
I haven't tried ethanol free fuel but I always fill up with 93 octane.
I think I'll give this a shot as well :)
Nice!
What year?
And yeah, everyone is saying that this only happens when the fuel injectors come in contact with ethanol.
I might start using Rudy's gas, but the regular unleaded right now is at $2.70, so I don't even want to know what the premium is at.
There's also a texaco on Airline off Cimarron that sells ehtanol free.

Summary: 
I have a BRZ with 14K miles and experience the same thing.
I think I'll give this a shot as well :)
