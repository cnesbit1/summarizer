Original Response: 
The majority of churches and Christian women today ignore and continually disobey the command for women to cover their heads in church (praying/worshiping).
When one reads 1 Corinthians 11 honestly and in good faith, it’s difficult to deny the clarity of the text on the issue of head coverings.
In fact, comparatively, the Bible is much clearer regarding this issue than many other issues.
How do Christian women and churches justify this weekly flagrant or ignorant disobedience?
If a main (perhaps *the* main) goal of a Christian’s life is to please God and obey his commands, why aren’t more churches dealing with this text and more women stepping up and covering their heads out of love and obedient devotion to Christ?
Wouldn’t God see it as worship if more churches and Christian women obeyed him despite fully understanding or particularly enjoying this command?
