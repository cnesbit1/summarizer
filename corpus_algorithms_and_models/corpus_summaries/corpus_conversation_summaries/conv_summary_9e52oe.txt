pretty fitting since soros sponsors antifa and was literally a nazi in his youth.
so you are neo nazis then?
the anglo establishment seems to be 100% nazis.
THIS ARGUEMENT IS LIKE FISCHER PRICE'S MY FIRST INTERNET DISCOURSE WITH PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE MY SHITTY POLITICS.
I CAN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE STILL MAKE IT WITH A STRAIGHT FACE LMAO.
ALSO AS FAR AS 100% GOES.
SEEING AS HOW YOUR RECENT COMMENTS ARE 100% IN THE WORLD OF WARCRAFT SUBREDDIT.
I'M GONNA GUESS YOU'RE 100% A FUCKING LOSER.

SO STANDARD THE ENTITLEMENT OF INTERNET EDGELORDS BE THAT THEY EXPECT POINT FOR POINT DEBATE ON KINDERGARTEN READING LEVEL POLITICS FROM STRANGERS.
IT'S NOT MY JOB TO TEACH YOU EMPATHY FOR OTHERS BUD.
WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU THOUGH, IS LET YOU BORROW MY LIBRARY CARD BUT ONLY IF YOU PROMISE TO TAKE OUT A BOOK ON THEORY MORE COMPLEX THAN SNEETCHES AND OTHER STORIES BY DR. SEUSS.
NO YOU‚ÄôRE JUST A FUCKING IDIOT WHO TAKES PEOPLE LIKE ALEX JONES SERIOUSLY.
still no denial on being a nazi and also detest empathy hmmm.
the fact that soros is a former nazi has been covered by the new york times.
genius.
Why can't you address his point?
You're doing your cause a disservice if you resort to ad hominems when asked simple questions.
Part of me wants to believe anti-fa is good, but I have second guesses when I see this.
THIS ISN'T REALLY A "SIMPLE QUESTION".
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY A QUESTION AT ALL.
THIS IS LIKE A PRETTY OLD FAR RIGHT TACTIC WHERE SOMEONE WITH NO INTENTION OF CHANGING THEIR VIEWPOINT BEGINS A SLOPPY EMOTIONALLY LABORIOUS SHITFIGHT IN AN EFFORT TO WEAR DOWN AN OPPONENT WITH SHIFTING GOAL POSTS, PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE RHETORIC, AND INTENTIONALLY FALSE CLAIMS.
AT THE END OF THIS ARGUEMENT, EVEN IF I'VE NAILED DOWN LITERALLY EVERYTHING FALSE ABOUT WHAT WILL END UP BEING A COMPOUNDING PILE OF INCREASINGLY DUMB AND OUTLANDISH CLAIMS THIS GUY WILL STAND UP AND STRUT OFF WHENEVER HIS THIRST FOR NEGATIVE ATTENTION IS SATED.
IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY MATTER WHAT I SAY, AND THE SPECTATORS FALL OFF AFTER FIVE OR SIX COMMENTS.
IT'S EASIER TO JUST LAY IN WITH EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS.
WHICH IS THE NEGATIVE ATTENTION, THAN TO WASTE MY TIME "DEBATING" IF YOU CAN EVEN CALL IT THAT LMAO.
MY HARD LEFT ONLINE DISCOURSE DAYS ARE DONE.
I AM RETIRED FROM DC9.
WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY AFFILIATED WITH THE SOROS FOUNDATION AT ALL.
WE KEEP SAYING THAT AS A JOKE BECAUSE THE FAR RIGHT BELIEVES GEORGE SOROS IS PERSONALLY FUNDING ACTIVISTS VIA LIKE LITERAL PAYCHECKS.
IT'S AS BIG A JOKE AS THE PHRASE "SO MUCH FOR THE TOLERANT LEFT".
I HAVE NO IDEA IF SOROS WAS IN SOME NAZI PROGRAM OR NOT AND I DON'T REALLY CARE.
WE'RE AFFILIATED WITH NO PARTICULAR ANTIFA^TM CHAPTER NOR THE SOROS FOUNDATION.
Okay that makes sense, after being in a ton of debates it would probably get old after awhile I would imagine.
I have another question (for you or any other user), outside of the music realm, such as opposing NSBM, what is Anti-fa's goal?
I know opposing fascism, but does the group seek a political revolution of some kind?
I am unsure of the larger picture, if there is one.
I AM UNSURE OF ANTIFA^TM S GOAL.
I LIKE, HAVE PUNCHED A LOT OF KIDS IN THE HEAD FOR SAYING STUPID SHIT TO ME BUT NEVER LIKE.
AS PART OF THE COLLECTIVE PUNCH.
ONLY FACE TO FACE AT SHOWS WHERE THEY OPEN WITH HOMOPHOBIC GARBAGE.
ANTIFASCIST AND ANTIFA^TM ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE TERMS AND I THINK IT'S WEIRD HOW OFTEN PEOPLE USE THEM SO.
EXCEPT FOR RICHARD SPENCER.
JUST KIDDING.
I PUNCHED THAT GUY EVERY TIME HE HAS EVER BEEN PUNCHED, AND WILL BE PUNCHED IN HIS WHOLE LIFE.
EVERY PUNCH TO THAT MAN IS MY WILL EXTENDED INTO THE UNIVERSE.
MY UNDERSTANDING OF ANTIFA^TM IS THAT THERE IS NO CENTRAL STRUCTURE.
NO JOINING PROCESS.
AND NO LIKE, WIDESPREAD DISCUSSION OF A PLAN.
OTHER THAN TO LIKE.
SHOW UP AND BEAT THE HELL OUT OF SOME DUDES WHO VERY CLEARLY NEED IT.
I THINK IF YOU WANTED TO UNDERSTAND ANTIFA^TM YOU WOULD HAVE TO FIND YOUR LOCAL CHAPTER AND WATCH THEIR TWITTER FEED.
IN FACT, I'D GO AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE NATIONS LIKE.
WEIRD PENCHANT FOR ANTIFA NEWS IS LIKE.
MORE OF A MIDDLE SCHOOL CRUSH THAN ANYTHING.
LIKE THE AMOUNT OF ADULT MEN WHO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ALONE IN THEIR ROOM FANTASIZING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND WRITING HOT AND HEAVY PARAGRAPHS ABOUT THEM IS KINDA BIZARRE.
IT'S GROSS HOW MANY PEOPLE LITERALLY FORM THEIR IDENTITY AROUND BEING "ANTI-ANTIFA" LIKE KIDS IN BLACK BANDANNAS ARE GOING TO SOMEHOW OVERTHROW LIKE THE MOST NUCLEAR ARMED GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD AND INSTITUTE MANDATORY SHARIA LAW AND EXECUTE PEOPLE FOR USING CERTAIN WORDS.
LIKE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT BE A PROUD BOY OPENLY MARCHING FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF WOMEN.
OR LIKE.
MILO YIANNOPOLOUS UP ON A STAGE SPEWING LIKE.
WILLFULLY IRRESPONSIBLE TRASH AND THEY NOTHING HAPPENS BEYOND SOME TOUGH TWEETS ABOUT YOUR SHITTY REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
HELL IF YOU'RE A PARTY REPUBLICAN IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO THREATEN YOU.
LIKE SHIT.
I THINK MITCH MCCONNELL SUCKS WAY HARDER THAN RICHARD SPENCER AND I THINK LIKE, NOT EVEN ANTIFA^TM FOLKS RAN HIM OUT OF A RESTAURANT LIKE ONE WHOLE TIME IN HIS 184 YEAR CAREER IN CONGRESS.
IT HONESTLY FEELS LIKE A DIRTY BAD BOY CRUSH BY A BUNCH OF NORMIES WHO FANTASIZE ABOUT VIOLENCE THEY WILL NEVER PARTICIPATE IN.
Tbf both the right and the left use that tactic equally.
‚òùÔ∏èüòÆ.
I TRY NOT TO ARGUE WITH LEFT LEANING PEOPLE.
SO I'VE NEVER TASTED THAT FROM THE LEFT.
Imagine being such a NEET dumbass that you take the Soros quips seriously.
WAR KAMPAIGN AGAINST YOU NECKBEARDS.
those aren't quips?
that's the story of his life...i mean??
?
He was a child during WW2....
he was basically, but that was also his and his families role.
i think that says a lot about how the establishment tacitly supported nazism as an elite agenda, then "discarded" it (well...the media representation of it).
i mean look how the bush family also banked for the nazis....
Yes IBM also did work for the nazis, the list can go on and on with just a bit of digging.
But 1. the soros doing work for the nazis myth has already been debunked as bullshit and 2. he.
was.
a. child 

Besides he pays well and I don't want you guys fucking with my money.
him working for the nazis wasn't debunked...he admitted to doing it.
and yes bankers and us corporate entities in general supported the nazis...so?
those are all part of the "establishment."
also he pays well?
he destroy countries economies.
thanks for admitting you are a paid shill though.
No problem.
I always do when I come up on someone idiotic enough to buy debunked conspiracies.
You know why?
No one will believe you and will think im just joking.
right no one believe me?
despite the new york times admitting this fact in an interview they did with him???
you are clearly allergic to facts.
