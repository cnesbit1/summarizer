Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is.
The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.
Hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered.
Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all.
Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are.
Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle.
As always please remember to read the FAQ.
Who knows - if your question is deemed to be helpful it may be added to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_good_starter_bike.3F) (which you should read)!

For my 2-year riding anniversary, I want to get some really nice adventure riding boots.
Recommendations?
I now wear Alpinestars Roam 2 WP boots.
These have been great, but I'd like something with more protection.
Specifically, taller.
I have basically zero shin protection.
Revzilla classifies the Roam 2's as "tall," but they are nowhere near as tall as Alpinestars Tech 7, for instance.
I'd like to protect my feet &amp; shins better than the Roam 2 WP can, with both waterproofness and breathability if possible.
Emphasis on the breathability, as I do a lot more riding in hot, dry weather than in the rain.
But if I splash through a puddle or encounter rain, I don't want wet feet.
Bonus points if the boots are reasonably OK for walking around off the bike (realizing that good hiking boots make lousy motorcycle boots and generally vice versa).
My Cycle Gear stocks some of the Alpinestars Tech series (1, 3, and 7), so let's use those as examples.
From what I've seen so far, the 7's are nicer than the 3's.
More protection, metal instead of plastic buckles, etc.
Some of the higher Alpinestars series (Tech 8, 9, 10) have a separate inner bootie.
Not sure I need that.
Does it add protection?
Seems like it might help with comfort, but also costs more.
It's not quite true that price is no object, but I can handle $300-$400 for boots if that's what it takes.
Sidi Adventure 2.
Those look really nice although $$$.
Is that what you wear?
nah.. but treat yourself.
After I shattered my calcaneus and my tibia I purchased a pair of Dainese D1 Torque Out Boots.
Also sweet as hell for street riding.
Your feet are valuable and a pair of good boots are way cheaper than medical bills.
I want to be sure I have the best boots available so even if something happens again, I know I did my part.
As for price, figure out your sizing in store and then check ebay.
I've seen em for under 300.
This is true.
I swallowed the $600+ price tag on my Helite Turtle airbag vest, and felt it was worth every penny after a crash a few weeks ago.
You couldn't pay me enough to have to deal with a broken bone.
I've been annoying the shit out of anyone who will listen to get them to ride with an airbag vest.
Already convinced one acquaintance, working on a co-worker.
:)

The Roam 2 boots have been great, but they just don't go up far enough or have enough protection overall.
nice.
I'm seriously considering one.
Yeah, bbroken bones suck.
And gear like this lasts a long time, so it hurts less down the road.
Indeed.
$25 for a new CO2 cartridge and the vest was back in biz.
The only sign it was ever in a crash was a little dirt.
A lot of people swear by the Forma Adventure boots for on/off road/ADV stuff and while I haven't tried them, they are at the top of my short list of boots to get/try.
Yep, those were the other boots I was looking at.
I'm getting a bit turned off to the Sidi Adventure 2's, the more I read about them.
For one:  $500, &amp; the sole is *glued* on, apparently.
Okay...maybe not a dealbreaker, but...
Per this discussion from about 9 months ago:

https://advrider.com/f/threads/thinking-about-sidi-adventure-2-gor-tex-boots-read-this-1st.1271847/

You can argue that any product will have the occasional defect, and yes glued-on soles is not necessarily a bad design.
There's an outfit called Factory Resole which can replace glued-on soles.
It looks like the Adventure 2's go for around $300 overseas, but we get to pay $500 for them in the US.
Boo!
Won't be buying anything until next month at the earliest anyway, so I have plenty of time to research.
[Daytona Trans Open](https://www.daytona.de/en/index.php?section=mediadir&amp;cmd=detail&amp;lid=1&amp;eid=13)
Sadly it does not seem that anyone imports Daytona's Trans Open GTX boot to the US.
:/

If I can find a vendor, though, maybe.
Damn.. Best of luck, then!
You could contact Daytona directly and ask - they should have a list of importers, I think.
Huh, didn't even know there was an Adventure 2 out.
I was thinking just the regular adventure (there's also a lower cut version too) boots which are \~$300:

We're talking about 2 different boots though.
You linked the Forma Adventure, I was addressing the Sidi Adventure 2.
