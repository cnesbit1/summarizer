Original Response: 
Is this allegedly a current photo?
My eyes gravitated towards that Rick'.
I wonder if my dad and I need to sit down and have a talk.
Saw them last summer, I would still bang her.
Yep.
She's been touring with Matthew Sweet to promote their new album of covers, so lots of recent photos out there.
Aging like fiiine wine.
She is mine, claimed her when I was 10 and willing to die to fulfill my obligation.
That picture is on her Wikipedia page and it says it was taken in 2008 ... making her either 48 or 49 in the picture..
I swear, too few people ever look anything up.Further down on her wikipedia page is a [picture of her from 2010](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/SusannaHoffsLiveinSydney2010.jpg), and she held up pretty good from the 2008 picture.
She's also married to Jay Roach, the producer of the Austin Power's movies and the Meet the Parents movies, and they have two children.She released two albums of covers with Matthew Sweet in the last 5 years, and one album with The Bangles.
That album came out in 2009, and that's when the tour was.
Sweet is releasing his own album this fall, and she is promoting the new Bangles album.

Summary: 
That album came out in 2009, and that's when the tour was.
