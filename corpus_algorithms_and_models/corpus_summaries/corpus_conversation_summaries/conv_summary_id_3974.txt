Photographed by George Holz in 2008, age 19http://nypost.com/2015/09/02/that-time-angelina-jolie-grabbed-a-knife-at-a-photo-shoot/&gt; I think she was 19 when I photographed her.
She was living in Nashville, and she’d come up to New York City.
We were downtown on Broadway just north of Houston.
She was looking out the window, and she looked over her shoulder.
It seemed like a wonderful, innocent time.
She didn’t seem overwhelmed by the city.
I knew she was going to be a force to be reckoned with.
I could just tell.
She had a confidence and comfort level.
You could sense that drive.
She had the body of a supermodel and a work ethic.
People and the camera just loved her.

Summary: 
She was so young back then.
She had a confidence and comfort level.
