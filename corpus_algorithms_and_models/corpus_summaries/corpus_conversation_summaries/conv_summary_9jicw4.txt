[redeem] 

EDIT: MY IGN IS 1 IN US!!!
EDIT AGAIN: My phone broke, and I won't be able to get it fixed until mid-October.
Proofs will now have to be taken with my old 3ds's crappy camera.
Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.
Hello, I have recently bought pokemon US.
I'm going to reedem 1 file worth of codes today and maybe another 2 this weekend.
As for this file I still have


Code | Reserved?
----|---------
Z | Reserved
T/T | Reserved
K/G | Reserved + next 2
L/L | Reserved + next 2
VC Celebi | Open
Poiple | Reserved + next 2
 I am looking for non T/T or Z NA codes, and if you want the full file done I might want a [2018 legend I don't have.]

Happy Trading.
Can you redeem a Zygarde code in exchange for a NA poipole code?
Yeah, I can do that.
Cool!
Could you soft reset for adamant if I offered 2 codes?
Also I would have to trade tomorrow if that’s alright.
Just trying to get it redeemed before it expires.
Yeah sure, but You might want to put your actual FC and IGN in your flair, so I know who you are in-game.
Yeah that's alright.
Also what proof would you like?
Yeah I had it but it screwed up and I can’t fix it until tomorrow.
Also photo proof would be good.
Ok, see you tomorrow then :).
Do you mind if I go ahead and send you the Zygarde code?
It won’t be valid tomorrow.
Yeah.
Even though it "expires" today, most codes so far have lasted like 3 extra weeks after their expiration when they can still be redeemed.
Ah okay, thanks for the info, code should be in your PM now.
Your Danger noodle is ready but we can trade tomorrow.
Ready to trade now if you change your FC.
edit: Also proof sent.

Summary: 
Yeah, I can do that.
Also what proof would you like?
