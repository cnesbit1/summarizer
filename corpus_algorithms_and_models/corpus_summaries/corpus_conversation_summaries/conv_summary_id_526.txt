Original Response: 
Will the mayor step down?
I read that's what some citizens are calling for....
Lots of people are upset, especially [this guy](https://www.facebook.com/yearsgone85th/posts/1238055396206571), but I hope she can step up to what residents want in a leader.
If she is incapable, I hope someone competent will replace her.
stepping down is well and good and all, but I sure would rather someone take some immediate action.
This city government is just terrible.
I agree with you, the time for action was when this first happened, so let's get it done...
I just moved here not long ago.
Got to experience the flooding (had to take my gf to the airport at 3:30am, almost flooded the car) and a week long water boil.
Going well so far :)

Summary: 
Will the mayor step down?
