I'll keep it short.
I'm interning in Corpus.
I like to fish, golf, hike, and be outdoors; however, I need to meet people to do it with!Any tips on places that college kids hang out at?Thanks!
Recess has a pretty good college crowd since it's close to the university.
Though in the summer college stuff is in short supply.
Try Coffee Waves on Alameda.
This is one of the only places in Corpus that doesn't close before 9 PM.
It's right next to the TAMUCC campus.

People who fish around here are generally very friendly.
You can easily meet people by just striking up convo at any of the piers, the beach, etc.
Shoot me a PM if you want.
I'm a student too and I love fishing, camping, etc.
I'd be happy to show you around.
Welcome to Corpus.
You must be under 21 because the bars are open later.
If you guys want a third wheel, I'll be showing up in June.
