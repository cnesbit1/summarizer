Original Response: 
I'm going to be down in your fair city for work in a few weeks.
Any breweries or brewpubs I should check out?
I've already been to Port Aransas Brewing.
I've heard that Railroad seafood restaurant downtown started brewing their own beer but last I heard they only had one in-house brew ready.

BnJs pizza (locally owned) brews their own beer.
For a variety of good beers, BnJs and Surf Club are your best bets.
Surf Club has $2 pints and live music on Tuesdays.
I am in the middle of opening up a nano called Lazy Beach Brewing (lazybeachbrewing.com or facebook.com/LazyBeachBrew).
Sadly we will not be in production by the time you get here.
We are still at the mercy of the government till all of our permits and licenses are approved.
It is a very.. very.. slow process.Till then get your local beer fix at B&amp;Js on Saratoga and Railroad Seafood (downtown).
Also since it is confusing.. BJs is a corporate run chain who does not brew their own beer, B&amp;Js is a local company and they do (at the saratoga location).
There's the Port A brewing company in Port A.
When did they start brewing?
what do they have?
I dont see anything on their website.
Any idea when you might open up?
Hopefully we will get the last of our licenses in about a month.
Then we can finally start to brew the beer which will take another month.
So hopefully around late april.
