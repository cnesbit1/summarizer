I lived through the mega bush days of pre-shaving.
Do not want.
Shaved all day long.
Probly less chance of crabs too.
Being clean shaven makes it unlikely to get crabs since they live on the hair.
However, it also means stds are more likey.
more likely how?

It’s basically creates a bunch of open wounds on the skin.
Razor burn or nicks are an opening for bacteria and viruses.
shit, now I have to be paranoid about this too...had sex with a girl who shaved in the morning.
Could I have gotten anything if we fucked by night..but I didn't have any open wound?
Jesus.
I'll stop having sex soon if I'm not dead by then...
Go get tested in a while for everything.
One encounter is unlikely to give you an std, but keep that risky shit going and you’re bound to catch something.
Risky?
i had protected sex with a normal woman.
What's that risky about this..
If you're monogamous, crabs aren't an issue.
Not sure what's normal about her, but if you are sexually active and don't have a monogamous partner you should get tested once a year or so.
Plenty of STDs are passed through skin to skin contact (which is made more likely with shaving, as hair provides a natural barrier) or oral sex if you don't protect for that.

Summary:
