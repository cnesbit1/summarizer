Original Response: 
Thats what happens when you go against public wishes and change the interface to something stupid and overly complicated that no one wanted then stubbornly refused to change it back

Instagram stories absolutely murdered snapchat...oh and the whole kylie jenner and rihanna thing too.
Just shows how bad pr can tank a company overnight.
Well to be fair Snapchats UX/UI team we’re always smoking hash.
It has always been the least user friendly design.
Exactly right.
The layout of the app has always been horrific.
It's just that people got used to it.
And that was Evan Spiegel's response to the new update "get used to it"

Umm no I'm just going to delete this app now and I haven't used snapchat since.
What was the Kylie / Rihanna thing?
Kylie tweeted ages ago that she rarely snaps but she seems like she's back now

Snapchat allowed a disgusting ad/filter/whatever relating to domestic violence and referencing Rihanna to go up.
Rihanna called them out on it.
Some idiot "accidentally" or carelessly approved a very tone deaf ad saying would you rather slap rihanna or punch chris brown and Rihanna told her fans to delet snapchat.
Their stock tanked 4% immediately after costing them $800 million

Kylie said something like "does anyone else not open snapchat anymore or is it just me" and stocks tanked 7.2% costing them $1.3 billion 

The power of social media influencers man.

Snap is going the way of Yik Yak.
Changes that nobody wanted nor asked for, and filled with clickbait garbage.
Not to mention unintuitive UI.
Most of my friends including myself used to use it daily, but with the huge UI change I’ll be lucky to get a single snap a week from people now.
Yik yak lol I remember that was hot in 2014.
Yik yak was awesome.
It was great up until they forced usernames on people and removed the Herd ability.
I’ve never seen an app go downhill so fast.
They backpedaled way too late.
For some reason companies have a hard time admitting that they messed up and revert unpopular changes.
They always revert a day late and a dollar short.
Remember when they released that blackface filter!?
Zero adults in the room, clearly.
Good times.
I'm glad Yik Yak was big when I was in college.
Shit was so much fun.
Yeah shit was awesome.
It was a great way to get news around campus really quickly too.
Maybe somebody should revive that whole idea.
It was basically like a twitter feed for your school but now students are relegated to individual Facebook groups which aren’t as poppin.
I’m sure that’s the next million dollar social media idea right there.
We were able to find some awesome parties with Yik Yak too lol.
It wouldn't be a bad model to resurrect.
I'm sure most college students nowadays don't even remember it.
Totally forgot about that aspect.
It definitely fostered a sense of community within the college.
But you’re right, for an app that was so widely used, it disappeared so quickly.
It was also cool because it wasn’t just limited to colleges either.
I remember using it to get restaurant suggestions, and some advice from locals when I went on vacation.
I think the model still has some viability, but the team that leads it needs to make sure not to stray away from the core model.
I'm all in on the conspiracy theory for this.
They make it confusing so old people don't get on Snapchat and ruin it, but kids in school who are physically near each other just tell other people about they new Snapchat feature they discovered.
Kids hated the update too.
I’d be interested to know if Jenner’s brokers shorted snap before she tweeted.
The market manipulation some people can cause is mind blowing.
Their position on the android app is endemic to how they treat their business as a whole.
They thought they were Microsoft but they're turning out to be a combination of Nokia and blackberry.
&gt;Well to be fair Snapchats UX/UI team we’re always smoking hash.
It has always been the least user friendly design.
definitely I would agree with you.
with regards to issues.
it is okay to have a open criticism.
Reminds me of a Dominica Phetteplace science fiction story called "Project Empathy."
&gt; Everyone at PCA was on a social network called Luck.
The interface was confusing.
Indeed, this was one of the advantages of Luck; it was difficult for outsiders to navigate.
&gt; I'm all in on the conspiracy theory for this.
Easy to do.
Snapchat is headed for failure, and I'm sure noone thinks otherwise.
Steady decline in users since Instagram stories.
On the inside, there are people pumping and dumping, or something equally shady.
Or they're deliberately running shit into the ground to be able to file for bankruptcy before their own salaries are unpayable.
There's definitely something behind the change of the user interface and the not giving a shit about all of the complaints about it.

They had no choice.
Their business model is based on their “discover” page or whatever it’s called, the one with all the ads on it.
Who tf even needs that page or goes on it at all?
Rhianna: "delet this"
I remember people posting dumb shit.
Including myself.
There was one Yik where a person posted, "Does anyone know if the Australian girl is single?"
and everyone at my college knew who the user was talking about and the best part is that she replied to the message.
The whole reason for the change is that the new UI is designed to be easier to monetize.
No need for a conspiracy theory.
The problem is that it’s not really monetizable.
Someone needs to build a P2P blockchain version of the app so that it’s serverless and doesn’t require any upkeep.

the ceo dude has already been dumping his stocks so he'll turn out fine.
it's the employees who will be screwed over.
[removed]
This makes me incredibly happy.
Let all other current &amp; future social-media companies beware.
End game wise.
It’d be nice if smart-phone centric social media was back in its golden-age.
Yik yak needs to comeback.
&amp;
Snapchat needs to revert to some of their old UI/features.
Facebook needs to be what it was back in 2009 - 2012, mixed with some of its features of today.
Instagram is fine how it is but needs to improve their stories algorithm by order of importance of people to you.
And a chronological feed *option*.
At least in this case social media influencers are influencing social media itself.
Kylie Jenner's opinion of Snapchat or Instagram is one the of the few things she is qualified to have a worthwhile opinion on.
People collectively lost their minds when Facebook introduced major changes to their platform (adding the wall, timeline, etc) but eventually got used to it and it became the new normal.
Spiegel probably thought he could make the same kind of plays.
Jodel, which has the same concept, is really popular in Europe.
Snapchat has always had a stupid overly complicated interface so I can see why they want to change it, they’ve just never improved it.
They still need to balance client satisfaction with the monetisation.
The overwhelming backlash to the change along with the steep decline in user numbers should concern them enough to reconsider some of their changes.
Pepperidge Farm remembers!
Sure, they should reconsider if that is actually what's driving their declining DAUs.
I just don't think that there's a pump-and-dump scheme behind it given that all of the reporting suggests that the founder/ceo was very much the driving force behind the changes.
Pretty sure the interface was stupid from the get go, or at least for me.
I had a difficult time figuring out what should of been the easiest thing, profile settings.
Hey, JohnK212, just a quick heads-up:  
**should of** is actually spelled **should have**.
You can remember it by **should have sounds like should of, but it just isn't right**.
Have a nice day!
