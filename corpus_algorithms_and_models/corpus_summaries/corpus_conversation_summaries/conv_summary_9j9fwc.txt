What was your lie of omission?
Pregnancy hormones are rough but aren’t “you had a quarter pounder for lunch and didn’t tell me so you lied by omission” rough.

$1500 is a lot of money when you have kids to raise.
You're gambling away their college education when you look at compound interest.
No wonder you feel you have to lie about it, because you're making shit decisions and you know better.
If your wife was posting I'd be advocating divorce.

Ah I see.
So that makes it okay to lie to your wife about where thousands of dollars go?

$100-200 a year while at a conference, sure.
Survivor pool?
Did we time jump to 2002?
I’m not really a gambler but $400 charged to a credit card sounds like you’re a pretty frequent gambler and do it on one of those websites the DOJ wants to shut down.
My husband losing $400 betting on sports while I’m risking my life baking his kid would be pretty rankling to me.
You estimate it’s between $1000 and $1500 a year.
This sounds like a pretty equitable solution.
You get your $1500 a year budget and she gets $1500 a year to throw off the roof of a building while you watch.

Your wife doesn’t accept these bullshit excuses and neither do we.

Dude your marriage is hanging by a thread.
Do you care about your wife at ALL?
Accept responsibility and apologize to her.
Save your goddamn marriage.

What you need to realize is that the trust is gone and all of the things you mentioned does not mend that.
The trust could be gone because of your actions or because of her insecurity.
Either way, it doesn't matter.
What matters is you two have to find a way to build that trust back up again.
If you two are in it for the long haul, I would recommend therapy.
Having an objective third party is very refreshing.
You're the one who makes that a concern for her.
Look: you have a fundamental disagreement about how much you should be gambling.
That's the root of this problem.
You need to work that out together and then stick to it.

Summary: 
What was your lie of omission?
You're the one who makes that a concern for her.
