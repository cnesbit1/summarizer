Original Response: 
Hey all, visiting North Padre/Corpus for the next week with my husband and our dog.
Are there any pet-friendly places?
I'd hate to leave him at the rental house all day.
I know some restaurants provide outdoor dining but I was wondering if anyone had a place they'd recommend other than the beach.
TIA !
Vernons is a dog friendly bar.
Black Sheep Bistro.
Padre Island Burger Company.
Seawall food and spirits,  they even have live music some days.
German Bakery on the Island.
Harrison's landing on the t head.
Both will let you have your dog on the back patio.
Also executive surf club down town.
Remember to contact your hotel about your dog.
Nothing will ruin your vacation more than being kicked out of a hotel room and charged an extra $250 for bringing a pet.
Come visit us at Don JorgeWe are an out side food trailer located in 3002 s. Port ave. we welcome your pets.
Best Tacos!
You'll have, we also serve a variety of authentic Mexican street eats.
Not to worry, we specifically looked for a rental house that accepted pets :)
We just arrived and are checking to see which of these is closest, I appreciate y'alls input!
