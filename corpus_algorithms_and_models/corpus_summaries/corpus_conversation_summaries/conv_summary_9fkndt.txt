Original Response: 
Is there any documented case about this exploit?
I don't think this exploit would actually work, as most network nodes would not relay transaction (2) (or 3) as it is a double spend.
There have been cases of people doing actually double spends though.
Peter Todd demonstrated one at one point.
Not some, it's happening all the time [https://doublespend.cash/](https://doublespend.cash/)
XT and BU nodes do relay first double spend, but they also warn you about double spend.
That page lists detected attempts.
How many times double spend won?
Only the sender and the recipient can know.
How many times double spend won, double spend that is detected by XT nodes and listed on that page?

Again impossible to know, how can you know which of the transaction is the legit one?
Ask the recipient.
The first one that the network sees is the 'legit' one.
No.
The one that makes it to a block is the legit one, or what would be the point of having a blockchain?
'legit'
Yes, so look again at the site you linked.

Summary: 
How many times double spend won?
Only the sender and the recipient can know.
