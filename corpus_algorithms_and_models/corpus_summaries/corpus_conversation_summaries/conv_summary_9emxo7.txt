Thanks for that.
This makes me smile :)
#WHY ARE WE YELLING?
“You want me to stay?”

“No, you can just email me the video”

“I’ll stay.”.
I can't stop laughing at the fish bowl sound effect when he says "Are you retarded?"
ARE YOU RETARDED?
!
ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY!
?
It does exist!
I wondered why we were watching pixelated soundless video in 2018.
Thanks.
My favorite part was how dumbfounded the cop was at what happened.
"Did he, uh.. did he just pass you?
On the right?"
He saw it and he still barely believed it.
YOU LIKE THAT, YOU FUCKING RETARD?
Eh, I prefer gifs and avoid video, especially on mobile.
I don't like waiting for the youtube app to load and oftentimes I'm in a public space and don't want sound anyway.
There's a few video formats that can be loaded inside apps.
Streamable, Gfycat, Reddit's own format.
All there without another app, the option to not have sound and often smaller than a gif.
It was great.
I loved how he just needed to confirm yes, he really did see what he thought.
I also loved the expression of resignation "yeah, he's on his phone".
Reddit videos load soooo slow on my phone, it's worse than youtube!
The others are fine though.
I just have no problem with gifs and I think they work fine for telling a short story like this.
