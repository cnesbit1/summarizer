*Crickets*....ha but try this http://www.whatsupcc.org there are other things happening but you may want to check the paper because not everything makes it to whatsupcc.
Dia de Los Muertos Street Festival - that's one of the biggest of its type in the country, and some people go all out getting dressed for it.
Not to be missed, in my opinion.
There are bands and food and art.
http://diadelosmuertoscc.comA couple Halloween-themed 5Ks in CC benefitting good causes, and also Berserkr games at a ranch outside of Kingsville, which is one of the most fun events around here, and it involves jumping from a helicopter into a pond and shooting guns.
Seriously.
Their web site isn't the best but I guarantee this event is the real deal and well worth the drive and entry fee.
http://berserkrgames.comThere are haunted houses at the USS Lexington and downtown, and probably more if you search.The corn maze in Robstown looks fun - I haven't ever done anything like that but have been wanting to try it.
http://rockinkmaze.comThere's always a ton of stuff to do outdoors here, especially now with the weather generally so beautiful this time of year.
But people will probably tell you there's nothing to do here.
Aw man I wanna go to the Day of the Dead Street Festival.
Thanks for letting me know about that one!
If you're a college student, go crash into Aspen.
Don't actually crash but you know... yeah.
hopefully the weather won't be too bad...
