Original Response: 
People probably don't care but worth pointing out that in 2015 Choice conducted a look into the origin of groceries from our supermarkets.
They found that

&gt;  But once you eliminated all those that were simply 'packed in',  'processed in' or 'made in' Australia, you were left with a much smaller  proportion you could be confident were sourced predominantly from local  suppliers based on their country of origin statements – just 41% of  Coles, 39% of Woolworths, 31% of market leaders, and 13% of Aldi  products in our snapshot.
&amp;#x200B;

So Coles and Woolworths clearly provide far greater jobs for Australian suppliers than Aldi.
&amp;#x200B;
Yep and aussie farmers are doing so well.
They screw each and every last one of their suppliers into the dirt and force them to screw over their employees just to stay afloat.
Everyone seems to think that but then if that were the case it would mean they would have the cheapest produce and there would be no need for Aldi to import produce since they could get it here from producers that are able to be so screwed down.
If you are the biggest buyer you can name your price, and um.... You don't have to pass it onto the consumer.
You can just keep that money.
Their profit margins don’t seem great, 45 billion revenue for 1.5 billion profit, not exactly a 100% markup on everything.
Coles and Woolies keep wasting it on Hardware boondoggles.
That keeps them closer to the margins.
I never said they were good at what they do, just that they have a monopoly.
But again that doesn't make sense, you are claiming they rip off all the producers, are more expensive than Aldi can import the goods so they have a larger margin but yet there margins are very small as their EOY results show.
I just don't think the obvious answer is that they run such a poor business model that they lose that money.
I think it's more plausible that they don't rip off producers like you make out.
Coles the supermarket chain had $40 billion revenue and 1.5 billion profit from that, none of this includes the hardware.
Or, possibly, the entire field of supply chain economics is more complicated than can be communicated through reddit.
I think it's a lot more complicated than simply saying Coles and Woolies rip off the producers.
Either way if Aldi can import and sell for cheaper than Australian produce from "exploited producers" then it makes you wonder if the Aldi producers are exploited but just in another country.
I fail to see how one can be this great global citizen selling cheaper goods and the other selling the more expensive goods by exploiting producers.
Price and quality, where it comes from does not matter.
Should American's and Canadian's stop buying billions of dollars of Australia wine because it isn't "local" or supporting their jobs?
Should almost every sheep farmer go out of business because the rest of the world should be buying more expensive and inferior meat from their local farmers?
I shop at Aldi because their prices are low and the quality of what they sell is high.
If their olives come from Greece why do I care?
First off  America and Canada don't purchase billions of dollars in Australian wine, Canada have large tariffs on Australian wine that we are currently fighting the WTO over.
On the sheep example, what market are you talking about here?
I'm not aware of a market we export sheep to that has the capacity to service their market with their own sheep.
&amp;#x200B;

If everyone thought like you then this country would be a disaster, we would have mass unemployment and we wouldn't have the skill set to be able to cater our own population in the event of a world crisis eg war.
I'm not saying don't buy anything from overseas but I'm saying if people don't consider where there products are coming from and aren't willing to pay a little more for Australian products that this country will go backwards.
Have you ever been to a Canadian liquor store?
I'm going to assume no.
Canada imports something like $185 million dollars of Australian wine every year.
Having spent 3 decades there I can assure that saying "Canada have large tariffs on Australian wine that we are currently fighting the WTO over" makes you look like an idiot.
BC, a small part of Canada, has a silly rule where only BC wine can be sold in grocery stores.
That is what is at issue currently.
But every liquor store in BC is going to stock dozens of varieties of Australian wine and that wine is price competitive with every other wine on the shelf.
The US imports nearly 500 million dollars a year of Australian wine.
You want both of those markets to cease importing Australian wine because they should be buying 'local' wine.
That would be a terrible blow to the Australian wine industry and the economy as a whole.
It would also be bad for Canadian and American consumers because that is how trade works.
Best thing, best price.
&gt; On the sheep example, what market are you talking about here?
I'm not aware of a market we export sheep to that has the capacity to service their market with their own sheep.
Every market where Australia exports sheep to could service their own market with sheep they would just cost more.
That's the entire point.
Australia does it better and cheaper those markets should import Australian sheep.
The reverse applies to Australia.
&gt; but I'm saying if people don't consider where there products are coming from and aren't willing to pay a little more for Australian products that this country will go backwards.
That's an ignorant lie.
If the entire world worked that way everyone everywhere would be poorer and worse off.
Australian sheep farmers and wine makers would lose their export markets and the consumers in those export markets would have to restore to more expensive and inferior local equivalents.
And the same applies for all goods.
&gt; Have you ever been to a Canadian liquor store?
I'm going to assume no.
Well you assumed wrong, I have and we had to search high and low to find anything other than bloody yellowtail, we finally found a store with some wynns and paid a premium for it.
$185 million is a lot less than the bull shit billions you stated.
Perhaps you should educate yourself on the current issue Australia has exporting wine to Canada https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/australia-takes-on-canada-over-problem-wine-exports-20180312-p4z3yd.html

First off the wine is such a shitty example because it normally doesn't compare apples with apples, different regions produce differen't types of wines.
&gt;Every market where Australia exports sheep to could service their own market with sheep they would just cost more.
Yeah going to need a citation on that, we export sheep to countries with horrible land for agriculture, it's simply not feasible nor do they have the skill sets to farm sheep on these lands.

No it's really not, when you take minerals out of the equation Australia has a negative export to import ratio.
How does it help Australia to import fresh food instead of producing their own?
What do those workers who people like yourself cost a job do?
I'm not saying everything should be bought Australian but I'm saying if it's not considered and we stop producing things in this country that the country is much worse off, we can't rely on minerals to keep our economy ticking along for ever, not unless people are prepared to take a hit to living standards.
Their supermarket margins are not impacted by other areas of the business.

I can walk into any liquor store in BC and buy something like 200 different Australian wines.
And the trade complaint is 100% about BC introducing its silly grocery store law.
I was born and grew up there I'm pretty sure I've got a more solid grasp on the issue then someone googling random things.
200 million a year is 1 billion in 5 years.
I didn't state a time frame.
The US is a billion every 2 years.
&gt; Yeah going to need a citation on that, we export sheep to countries with horrible land for agriculture, it's simply not feasible nor do they have the skill sets to farm sheep on these lands.
You need a citation for countries with poor land and bad skill sets ability to raise sheep?
Anything is possible with money.
Cut off the Australian supply and when the cost of lamb goes from $10/kg to $80 someone will figure it out.
Or more likely they'll switch to beef.
But that's not actually relevant.
Everywhere can do anything give me enough money and I'll grow oranges in Antarctica it will just be horribly inefficient.
Australia does amazing world class things and it makes a bucket of money from them.
The rest of the world also excels at things and if you recognize that everyone everywhere is better off.
&gt; How does it help Australia to import fresh food instead of producing their own?
That one seems to be the straw man people like to trot out but really, what fresh produce is being imported?
I'm not sure I've ever seen a fresh tomato, carrot, celery, beat, potato, or any other fresh vegetable from "away'.
Then again if someone wanted to get a better and cheaper tomato to South Australia from Mexico I'd buy it in a second.
You are welcome to support inefficient local production.
It won't help anything and it rewards people doing a bad job.
But when I'm home in Canada I buy Australian wine and lamb because they are better and cheaper then the Canadian equivalents and when I'm in SA I follow the same life rules.
Cost and quality.
Reward people doing the best job.
This isn't the government I'm not using my money to reward mediocrity.
Edit:

Have you ever seen the Canadian wine selection at a big Dan Murphies?
Oh, wait no.
Protectionism is only unfair when other people do it...

Wow, what a gotcha moment you have there, do you realise how stupid it sounds to say I meant over years not 1 year, anything worth a monetary figure is is worth billions in exports then, just a matter of time frame.
Didn't look in Vancouver, didn't see any Australian wine other than yellow tail in Banff, didn't see anything but yellow tail in most of the places we went to in Alberta.
After a very long search in Whistler we finally found a niche little store that sold Wynns, this was 5 years ago so maybe things have changed but it was bloody hard to get Australian wine other than yellowtail, sorry but you actually picked the wrong person to try and pull the "you have no real life experience" argument.

How about you provide your citation first, it's pretty common sense that a desert doesn't provide great land for farming, granted it is true you can produce almost anything with unlimited resources but who wants to spend that on farming stock just to prove your point while losing a fortune.

This would be fantastic if it were all on an equal playing field, but it's not.
Some of the countries we import from don't have the same environmental, OHS, labor conditions as we do.
You call it inefficient but we could compete at the expense of these factors if we didn't have that legislative framework in place.
So sure if you want a race to the bottom remove these  regulations and I bet you we could beat all other markets.
&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
You have no life experience if you think that hundreds of millions of dollars is peanuts and Australian wine isn't commonly available in BC.
Sorry mate, not sure what else there is to say.
Trade makes people rich, isolationism and protectionism makes em poor.
Maybe you should venture out of BC because I’m telling u unless u just count yellow tail it’s very difficult to find Australian wine, clearly u should travel more.
The only people who are made rich by trade is multinationals like Aldi.
