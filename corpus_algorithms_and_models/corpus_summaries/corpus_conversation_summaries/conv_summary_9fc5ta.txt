0% chance he will eat his dick no matter what the price is.

You need to watch the documentary *The Dangerous Life Of John McAfee*.
We're all assuming McAfee **doesn't** want to eat his own dick.
We're probably wrong.
It's a Kansas city shuffle.

I saw that Netflix show on him.
Wait, so you are suggesting that he will eat someone else's dick?
I bet he already bought the stem cells needed to clone his dick so he can eat it without cutting it off.

That can't possibly be an email he personality checks.
***mcafee wants to know your location***
He bought a cow named Dick and will have a barbecue with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
He never specified what kind of 'dick' he was going to eat, he only specified it would be 'his' dick.
He might have a few cans of [Heinz Spotted Dick](https://www.amazon.com/HEINZ-PUDDING-SPONGE-SPTD-DICK/dp/B000FP5K0U) in his prepper stash for all we know.
He‚Äôll eat a nice can of spotted dick.
He didn‚Äôt say what kind of dick.
‚ÄúDoes that dick come in cans?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot since college, my friend.‚Äù.
Only one way to find out.
Well it's deleted now, so we will never know.

Sounds good!
Waiting if his prediction is right.
Actually if you can lab clone dick meat and make a burger out of it it really does not sound that bad.
Make a food truck out of it and cash in on the free publicity.

there is a sub I recently discover.... /r/enoughinternet or something like that.
That is the only reason I doubt your 0%.
After visiting that sub once, I am convinced I can no longer know what is possible or not anymore regarding crazy people doing crazy stuff....

bottom line, there is always a chance.

I don‚Äôt think people will be lining up to eat cloned dick meat.
Jesus Christ... l couldn‚Äôt even bare 3 minutes in that sub.
That‚Äôs going to bring my mood downs for a good couple of hours.
The fuck is wrong with people.
Found the guy who secretly loves dick!
Dont be afraid to come out.
Never been to Japan, have you?
Twice.
They do eat some weird things but I‚Äôm standing by my original statement.
Cloned dick meat is just too far gone.
