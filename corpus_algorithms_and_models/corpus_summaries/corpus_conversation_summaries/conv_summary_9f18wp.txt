Original Response: 
In Leviticus 18:22 god tells Moses that lying with a man as with a woman is an abhorrence.
Yet throughout history god has chosen to carry on creating homosexuals who aren't allowed (by god's standards) to enter into complete loving relationships like heterosexuals.
Doesn't this seem cruel and unfair?
Why single out certain people to be cursed like this?
(Again, cursed by god's standards, not mine)

Maybe it's an extra test for homosexuals to grow more as people, but that doesn't seem right since not all homosexuals are born into the same society and some will face harsh persecution while others (hopefully) can lead lives just like everyone else.
To me, something just doesn't add up.
Any ideas why god would do this?
