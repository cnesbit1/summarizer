Hey all, we need to get rid of this big boy ASAP, as we can NOT have him in the apartments we live in.
We found him in our apartment complex on Moore Ave.
He's covered in tics so he probably has been outside for a while.
[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/aAs6H.jpg)[Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/aey9J.jpg)We've nicknamed him Bubbles, and he's adorable.
Looks like some signs of abuse, (maybe a cigar burn on his foerehead, and he's very, very hungry).
His ears are also clipped.Please someone come take this gorgeous guy!
We really don't want to take him to the pound, and even when we called the cops and got them to come down, they wouldn't do anything.

Summary: 
He's covered in tics so he probably has been outside for a while.
