What happened?
They got demoted to As and Williams is now captain.
Jordan staal and who was the other one?
Faulk.
What's your opinion on the situation?
My opinion is that Bill Peters's decision to go with co-captains was a wrong answer to a question where there were multiple correct answers.
Faulk, Staal, Williams, and Skinner.
But no, BP somehow came up with a wrong answer.
The entire debacle didn't make sense and frustrated literally everyone involved.
Look at interviews from the team that occurred yesterday.
Everyone was happy that Williams got it finally, especially Faulk.
Go and watch that interview, he looks leagues happier this year.
The majority of the fanbase agrees that the situation was bad.
-2 swedish captains, +1 (OEL)

Summary: 
What's your opinion on the situation?
Faulk, Staal, Williams, and Skinner.
