That's definitely enough time, I mean all he really did was distribute a string of 1's and 0's.
I've seen people get less time for assault...
But this is a type of sexual assault?
At least it is according to the DOJ / National Institute of Justice:

Sexual assault covers a wide range of unwanted behaviorsâ€”up to but not including penetrationâ€”that are attempted or completed against a victim's will or when a victim cannot consent because of age, disability, or the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Sexual assault may involve actual or threatened physical force, use of weapons, coercion, intimidation, or pressure and may includeâ€”
Intentional touching of the victim's genitals, anus, groin, or breasts.
Voyeurism.
Exposure to exhibitionism.
Undesired exposure to pornography.
**Public display of images that were taken in a private context or when the victim was unaware.

No wonder no one takes rape seriously anymore, it's in the same category as spreading a list of 0's and 1's on the internet lol.
just curious - what amount of time would have been appropriate in your opinion?
I think any degree of assault should be at minimum 5 - 10 years.
Love how you minimize the hacking of about 240 people to steal their personal, private, intimate pictures and videos... and then distributed them over the internet, where the whole world now has access to these private things.
Itâ€™s a complete and total violation.
i personally believe that mandatory minimums do much more harm than good (just look at the african american community with drugs).
But i'll agree that I think this case probably warranted a harsher sentence.
I guess child pornographers are just spreading data too.
Your statement is bullshit.
Are you insane?
That would stand in no relation to sentences for other crimes.

So what I was dealing heroin.
All I did was sell a bunch of molecules.
Theyre just atoms guys.

Summary: 
But this is a type of sexual assault?
