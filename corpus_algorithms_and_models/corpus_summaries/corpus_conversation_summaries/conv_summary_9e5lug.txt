Original Response: 
Furthermore, how can scientist tell anything about the dinosaurs beyond the bones?
Like skin texture and sounds.
I love this album of modern animals drawn like dinosaurs.
Gives you an idea of the challenges faced when considering fat distribution, skin texture and other surface features.

My only complaint is they ignored any type of ear on the baboon and cat, while the rhino and horse retain them.
And a swan should have a secondary wing "digit".
[removed]
Thanks for sharing!
That’s really interesting.
I wish there was one for a human.
This mainly goes to show how big a problem shrink-wrapping is in paleoart.
Dinosaurs are frequently drawn to look as lean and muscular as possible, almost to the point of having zero fat reserves.
Like [this delightful illustration here.
](https://wi-images.condecdn.net/image/p0wm8oY6jJw/crop/1620/f/ju_paleoart_p264-265.jpg)

The album is from a book called All Yesterdays, which also presents speculative reconstructions of dinosaurs as different from the picture I linked as real animals are from those in the album above.
Right?
I was just thinking that fatty features like breasts and waists and butts or cartilage like noses and ears wouldn't survive as well and might be more guesswork.
maybe the tailbone would be more pronounced as a nub rather than totally buried.
the nose would be pushed up like a chimp nose.
the ears might be pointed, or missing, or the wrong size.
the hands might have less webbing and be more bony like the grasping hands of bush babies or other small primates.
the feet might have the toes fused more.
and the lips and eyes might be all wrong!
giant marble eyes with thin little lids, sticking out too far.
and big wide lips that go all the way back to where the molars are.
it would look terrifying.

skeletal remains are never perfect, maybe the specimen they had drawn off of was missing them?
Artists can't make up everything!
I'm sure you can find pictures of totally emaciated humans that aren't far off...

This is awesome.
Thank you.
In all fairness.
The baboon one may not be aesthetically correct, but it is an excellent representation of their disposition.
This is not even close to accurate.
This would just be fodder for creationists and those they wish to deliberately deceive.
We have a very rich fossil record now and knowledge of anatomy that enable us to piece together what dinosaurs actually looked like and how they functioned.
The information we have now would preclude us of drawing non-reptilian animals "like dinosaurs" in the first place.
[removed]
I mean it does make some sense.
The majority of reptiles have a bit of a shrimper wrapped body as well.
When people assumed dinosaurs would look similar to the reptiles we have today, it makes sense.
The prehistoric mammals don't have as much of the problem as we add fat reserves and fur onto them.
Yeah, the baboon one is actually not too far off.
It's just a skinny, shaved one.
[removed]
It's what I would draw if someone asked me what a baboon should look like.
I have a feeling you are not at all familiar with Science, let alone paleontology.
You can do quite a bit with "just three or 4 bones," if you have [the right bones, and/or teeth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qW256pUdYg), as the case may be.
No one takes "3 or 4 bones" and makes a model of a dinosaur or other animal de novo.
Those few bones will have to be strongly linked to some other known creature before they can be used to try to flesh out a model of the individual those bones came from.
I'm a research scientist so I know how rigorous is the process to get something published, let alone develop a model that requires very many publications of reproducible data reviewed by skeptical peers before it is seriously considered in your field.
I don't expect laypersons to appreciate this process, so I understand the layperson's strongly held skepticism of something they really do not fully understand.

Yes, it should be noted that every shrink-wrapped animal in that album is a mammal.
I'd mostly agree with what you said, but I want to point out some exceptions that in my opinion are significant.
I'd argue that there are numerous examples of reptiles that are not at all shrink-wrapped, like the [Argentine tegu](https://bugwoodcloud.org/mura/ECISMA/assets/Image/dirtydozen/tegu/red_tegu.jpg) and the [American alligator](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Cy2akN2bTX4/maxresdefault.jpg).
We do see extreme shrink-wrapping in birds, but this effect is offset by their feathery coverings, so this should be reflected in paleoart as well.
I'm using the term shrink-wrapping to describe an actual phenomenon in living organisms, but really the term only applies to how artists depict an animal.
I'm not exactly sure what term you'd use to describe a lack of non-boney accoutrements or excessive fat reserves.
Also, the prehistoric mammals we depict in paleoart tend to be from the glacial Pleistocene, so naturally they're drawn with lots of fur.
Popular depictions of older Cenozoic mammals like this [Hyaenodon](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/cooldinofacts/images/4/45/H._gigas.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120115130555) and this [Chalicotherium](https://dinosaurworld.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Chalicotherium-2.png) are pretty badly shrink-wrapped.
I have the link for that one.
Ping me in ten hours for it, when I'm at my home PC.
Yeah, totally agree.
I was just saying it makes sense why early artists who tried to depict these animals did so the way they did.
If they are going from just the skeleton, it's very hard to figure out what something actually looks like.
Ears, noses, boobs, dicks, anything not from the skeleton is just conjecture.
But with more and more info and these better preserved fossils, we can get closer to filling in that gap.
I believe it's less that 'we don't have evidence for how dinosaurs looked' and more 'drawings of dinosaurs are often not drawn in accordance with evidence from modern animals'.
These are all, very intentionally, the equivalents of things such as brachiosaurs with nostrils on the tops of their heads or 'feathered' raptors with nothing but a plume on their head and arms.
[removed]
This book was written and illustrated to show how we revolutionized out thinking of dinosaurs in the last 30 years.
It is essentially pointing out how drawing dinosaurs in the Jurassic park or earlier popular styles were terrible in their shrinkwrapping.
It is pointing out how wrong our previous media representations have been and demonstration why the whole "But they looked COOLER when I was a kid, I am going to stick to that" mentality can detrimentally effect paleontology as a whole.

Skin texture?
How about COLOR?
Examination of fossils has uncovered cells responsible for pigmentation!
https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dinosaur-was-iridescent-crow-180967841/

Fossils aren’t just bones.
Fossils are preserved parts of all kinds, including preservation of the impression that the skin has made against whatever material fossilized.
https://m.ebrary.net/3944/history/dinosaur_skin

This article has a picture of some fossilized dinosaur skin impression, and also notes the different parts of creatures that have been found fossilized.

[removed]
So you're telling me we know close to nothing about how dinosaurs looked?
[removed]
That's maybe accurate how it was 100 years ago, but these days we have fossils detailed enough to see the ear bones, feathers, skin... We can read a lot into bite marks, footprints, and so many more things, compare them to modern animals.
We can look at bones and determine how much it's carrying, figuring out how large of a muscle connected to it.
We can look at the teeth and deduce their diet and thus their body plan.
And all of this can be reviewed together and compared to really understand it.
So this is a cool idea, but these days, it's just not true.
[removed]
[removed]
A lot of what has been popularised in the media is incorrect, but scientific understanding really has progressed a lot.
It's just the image of dinosaurs as smooth, often spiny lizards caught on in the cultural imagination.
[removed]
Is the book called All Yesterdays?
I feel like in general with the anti scientific sentiment over the last several decades people’s understanding of what we know and understand is unbelievably out dated.
I mean we’re living through a golden age of astronomy but people dismiss then foundations of the science as little better than guesses even though they continued to prove themselves out.
I love that we have proof of blackholes.
How cool is that!
Scientists predict this seemingly nonsensical thing, but that’s what the math shows.
And now here we are , able to see their impact on astronomical bodies.
One cool example is the black hole at the center of our galaxy who’s gravity is so immense that it’s causing the nearby stars to zip around it at unbelievable speeds.
That looks like the type of childishly naive nonsense creationists use to confuse laypersons.
Yes, thank you!
It’s really not, it shows how what we think changes the more evidence we get!

So everything we have but more metal?
I'd like to think future scientists would do a better job than *this.

As long as we have reproducibility crises like social psychology has right now, and as long as nutrition science keeps doing whatever nutrition science does, the general public will still be skeptical of science.
Science as a vehicle of social learning still needs a lot of improvement; I read yesterday that there's an entire journal edited and funded by supported of Myers Brigg and by sales of the indicator.
(Journal of psychological type).
I'm not somehow shitting on science as a whole, I'm just playing a bit of devil's advocate here.
I don't think these people have the scientific literacy to figure that out.
There's plenty of rigid science that is beyond doubt, and there will always be science that isn't all that pure.
The issue is that people have been taught to distrust their government and corporations, I think.
When he government is spying, listening to lobbyists, giving contracts to friends, testing diseases on its own people... What reason do people have to believe them that they should get a flu shot?
Are you sure it's totally dead now?
It's declined for sure, but I still pretty frequently see contemporary reconstructions of semi emaciated dinosaur bodies and limbs supporting skulls wrapped in a thin layer of skin.
Skulls have less attachment points, and a lot of dinosaurs appear to of also had fat layers.
But that usually gets forgotten about.

It's not that wrong depictions are gone, but scientists aren't making these mistakes.
The Flintstones is still a depiction, but no one thinks that's realistic.
[deleted]
It could still easily be true to an extent.
If there is a completely deteriorated component of external appearance, how would they know about it?
Sure.
It's just not as different as that.
It's like the statement that the world is a sphere - it's not.
It's not even a flattened sphere.
We're close at that point, but there are always refinements.
[removed]
&gt;	Flipflopping between “this is good for you” to “this kills you” to “this is good for you” again makes anyone mistrust.
But that’s typically the fault of science reporting, from the university press release to the mainstream media, feeling the need to sensationalize and define some absolute result.
The actual scientific papers are usually cautious about their conclusions, and wouldn’t really conclude something like “X is good for you”.
EDIT: [Relevant PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1174)
I think peoples problem with the scientific community actually has more to do with how bizarrely and smugly entrenched scientific dogma can become, and how any scientists introducing radical new concepts are deemed "outsider scientists" are usually mocked out of hand.
No matter how valid or invalid their point or theory may or may not be.
Which I imagine strikes a lot of average people as pretty unobjective, odd, hypocritical, and confidence shaking.
What considering how many times in human history outsider thinkers have introduced concepts that were initially almost instantly dismissed by mainstream science because it didn't fit into whatever model of reality was in vogue at the time.
Only to eventually have the current model be proven wrong and the old way of thinking fall into archaic or pseudo-science.
Sometimes after 100's of years of barking up the wrong tree because of it.
I think scientists need to emphasize far, far more that there are things that are nonsense to them in science as well.
But that it just means we don't know how something works yet, or that some of our general assumptions may be mistaken or not accurate enough.
Otherwise to most people I think a lot of science just comes across as self assured, smug elitism based on a lot of opinion, and a handful of facts.
Instead of the process that it is.
Oh and maybe it's also time to finally admit just how personally and emotionally invested scientists can become in developing a theory.
I think it’s *All Yesterdays: Unique and Speculative Views of Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals*.
Looked really interesting to me but I was never able to find a paper copy.

I still see "wrong" (aka outdated) depictions of dinosaurs by scientists getting made.
Less for sure.
But I still see them.
Them fat reserves often get forgotten about even by them.
Since we only recently discovered just how much fat a lot of dinosaurs were carrying around.
And don't even get me started on feathers and feather like structures, and how inconsistently professionals get what species had those right.
From what I've seen dinosaur reconstruction is currently in the middle of an update.
Not done with it.

Remember there is a difference between scientific reporting and scientists them selves.
Most scientific papers are incredibly careful with their claims.
Those theories that are outliers may prove themselves to be correct and in fact that’s exactly how science works.
How science safely informs society is through consensus.
The reason it’s so critical is because lay people aren’t actually qualified to determine which argument is right.
Because no matter how many analogies are used, the underlying science and research are complex.
That means these ideas (particularly those that make big claims) need to pass through the review process, attempts to reproduce the findings and looking to other fields that would corroborate the new ideas.
Eventually when an idea is correct and stands up under rigorous inspection, that moves to the new consensus point.
Honestly I used to see science the way you’re describing but the more time I spent studying science on my own, the more a realized that it’s often scientific reporters trying to bring in ad revenue than the scientists themselves who bring the big claims.
The reason scientists who side with the consensus are so confident is they know how much evidence and study it took to make that understanding the consensus.
Yes, scientists are people too and it can become personal.
But the *vast* majority of scientists stick to their own field and just try to follow where the evidence leads.

All of these drawings is basically a skeleton with skin/pelt around it.
Do we depict every dinosaur the same way; they kinda seem more "meaty" then the illustration you linked here.
I went to a private Christian high school in the late 80’s so I’m more than passingly familiar with it.
I agree obviously about the alliance, but these are sincerely held beliefs by the majority of conservative Christians.
I remember evolution being mocked well before the Reagan era.
This was already part of the Christian world view, I think a push was made in the public schools as a part of it, giving us things like “teach the controversy “.
Yes, it existed long before Reagan.
But it was with the Reagan Revolution where it went from an extremist fringe to having a seat at the table with the people running the government.
We used to, up until maybe Jurassic Park (the film) in the public perception (if not in the contemporary scientific records) the idea of dinosaurs as kinda baggy sacks of meat and skeleton was pretty popular.

No, not at all.
50+ years ago "Dinosaurs."
as a trope for ancient creatures, were basically depicted the same as they are now, with some refinement driven by modern discoveries.
Source;  [Image](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4vu44T_p3XA/TtpI4e1dEaI/AAAAAAAAAeY/HfYHzrpkybM/s1600/Tyrannosaurus.jpg) from a 1966 publication.
[A painting](http://www.billymeieruforesearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Pteranodon-Comparison.jpg) from 1960.
Even on those the arms and heads are cut super close to the bones and there’s no idea of frills or feathers or anything like elephant noses or rhino horns that may possibly have existed.
Imagine T Rex with a prehensile nose that took the place of arms.
(Chances are the skull would not support that but the fossil record wouldn’t keep a trunk we haven’t thought about intact either)

So they were reconstructed saggy bags of meat and skeletons, but mostly browns, greys, and greens.
Which makes sense if you look at modern lizards but not if you look at whales or kiwis.
Don’t get me wrong, I love dinosaurs and now I want to ask what your favorite one is because in baggy meatspace I never get to talk about this, there are so many possibilities that are being proved/disproved everyday and without imagination and very specific science to investigate it we would be at serious loss.
(So, what is your favorite dinosaur?)

Speaking as somebody who moved from true science with a degree in chemistry to social science with a degree in sociology.
The issue isnxt that social science has false conclusions.
The problem is that there are far too many variables to account for.
In social science we look at a person with every second of their life being a variable.
True psychologists or sociologists would never present something as absolute truth but merely as a widespread pattern that may apply to others.
The real issue is people taking that idea out of context and saying that this pattern applies to all regardless of background.

Not to mention, our idea of what dinosaurs looked like is -constantly- changing.
There are dinosaurs I know of from when I was a kid that aren't dinosaurs anymore, because we were wrong about the very fact that they existed.
Also, not long ago, they found a chunk of a dinosaur that was fossilized in amber.
It's covered in feathers.

We can alsi tell what an animal probably looked like with phylogenetics in the absence of direct fossil evidence.
For instance while we have no fossil feathers from Utahraptor or Terror birds, we can conclude that they most likely had feathers since a lot of their closest relatives had feathers.

&gt;The issue is that people have been taught to distrust their government and corporations, I think.
&gt;

Taught in the sense that they made the connection themselves, I'd say.
Another example is in the media, where a person presenting an argument has their argument refuted by discrediting the person with whatever dirt they can find.
This is a staple of politics.

I don't think people have the stomach for (pardon the pun) thorough nutritional science.
There are just too many variables at work and until we can account for all the variables in a system, it will be easy to dismiss as "bad science".
My personal opinion is that this area could revolutionize the world in the areas if sustainability, health, and medicine.
Designing the sensors that could analyze the chemicals and their reactions in real-time is a bit of science fiction at the moment.
There us considerable work and money that would have to be applied.
There isn't an apparent need right now so the status quo will continue.
