Original Response: 
Good.
Lord please forgive me for even reading this crap.
Would you be so pleased with blasphemy laws for Mormons, which quite a few Christians mock?
Or for Muslims, which the majority of you mock?
No, obviously.
I barely even think these religions should be legal.

Uh, what century is this, again?
As an American I find any assertion against complete freedom of religion to be absolutely shocking and disgusting.
Freedom of belief and conscience is something I consider absolutely sacrosanct.
&gt;which the majority of you mock?
Mmmmm I love the smell of blanket generalizations in the morning.
Search Muslims in r/Catholicism or r/TrueChristian.
Hell, search it here and a fair few threads will be hate.
“But Muslims are the evil ones!
They’re trying to force their religion on others and have blasphemy laws!”.
That’s not what I criticise Muslims for.
I’m not an American, in fact I live in a country with a state religion.
It may sound rude but I just don’t really care what you consider ‘as an American’.
Our religion is not Americanism nor Presentism.

Why?
Oh I thought you were referring to Christianity as a whole.
And yeah you're right, they have a hate boner against Muslims.
&gt; Uh, what century is this, again?

No one cares what you Yankees think anymore.
Keep bombing brown people just because they have religion as the law of their land.
You Yankees are so arrogant in thinking every one wants democracy and your political system.
Look at what happened in Iraq.
You wanted them to vote so badly but in the end they just reverted into the Islamic State.
I reject your faulty Enlightenment democracy and "muh freedoms!"
and one day the Independent Republic of Texas will be free from this evil Union once again!

Year 201718?
We didn't go to Iraq to 'free' them or promote democracy.
As an aside, what government do you plan on the IRT having?
&gt; and one day the Independent Republic of Texas will be free from this evil Union once again!
Holy shit are you real?
😂😂.
LOL, k.
Forced belief imposed by the state is an oxymoron.
Genuine faith is only between the individual and God.
People's religious belief is between the individual and their maker.
It is no business of the state to tell people what to believe.

Summary: 
That’s not what I criticise Muslims for.
