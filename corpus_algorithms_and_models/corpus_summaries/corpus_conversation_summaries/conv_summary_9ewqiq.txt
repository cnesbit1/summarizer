Original Response: 
After almost 3 months of hard work, I present you my Heart of Thorns TacO Mega Pack:-) 
I've basically covered everything that has some static point to relate marker to.
Chest Farming Routes for all zones, Mastery Points, Hero Points, Adventures, Achievements you name it.
I've especially focused on **Tangled Depths** since it's a very complicated map.
Every Hero and Mastery Point has a separate route from nearby waypoints as well as most of the achievements.
**Preview:** https://ctrlv.cz/shots/2018/09/11/YRsv.png

**WARNING** When you turn on TacO for the first time all markers and trails will be active and it will look really messy.
Don't panic, just navigate in TacO Menu -&gt; Tekkit's Guides -&gt; Heart of Thorns -&gt; and disable everything you don't wanna see.

Had my first full-day sit down and play session yesterday since coming back after 5 years.
Spent most of it in Verdant Brink confused as all hell.
Downloading these tonight for great success tomorrow :p.
Verdant was hell of the ride only airship cargo has over 1000 spots:-P.
Yeah I actually ended up turning TaCo off a few hours later as i was doing something and was too overwhelmed by all the cargo spam.
I'll sit down and learn it all some more in coming days.
Right now I'm at a brick wall of deciding what to do from LS2, HoT, PoF in circles.
Unlock this, do that, get this mastery to do that!
Oh whoops you can't do this HP yet!
Insert head explosion here.
I think ultimately I need to find a HP train and then go at my own pace when I have specs unlocked fully.
That's why I made trails what you can mindlessly follow and loot them all :-) (don't forget to turn off default taco markers for cargos tho)
Much appreciated :D.
Exploring through Verdant Brink blind when HoT first came out is one of my top five favorite memories in gaming ever.
It's one of the only experiences that's been able to capture that childlike sense of excitement about gaming since becoming an adult.
Enemies were in an entire different class of difficulty than vanilla which made everything dangerous and exciting, the vertical space to explore was full of secrets and cool things to find, shit hits the fan during the night phase opening even more areas to explore, and the general fantasy of the meta events is awesome as you barely struggle to hang onto a foothold deep in unknown enemy territory.
None of the other zones in GW2 that have been released since have been nearly as cool as VB in my opinion.
It can suck a little bit that certain areas are locked behind mastery grinding, I definitely complained about that back when I was going through it, but I would recommend not using any guides for the first week or two and just enjoying the experience.
At the very least go join HP trains in other maps and save the exploration of VB to do on your own :P.
It has been pretty fun I will admit.
I haven't really used any guides and only just got TaCo yesterday (and don't even know how to use paths yet).
I'm missing like 2 PoI (chopper based I think) and like 2 HP that require people (golem and guano?).
I only have updraft thus far so mushrooms all over zone are useless to me.
The rest was from good old trial and error.
I'm pretty good at jumping off cliffs trying to find stuff with glider bombing haha.
Just all a lot to take in at once.
I had done part of LS2 but jumped in to HoT to unlock glider and kind of stuck with it.
Just a word of warning - taco is obviously a great helper for some stuff, but it really breaks the games feel for me (and a lot of others).
It turns into "follow this, go here, do that, where is the next thing", removing all the exploration &amp; discovery, making you look more at the route than the world.
I mentioned before but I had turned it off halfway through.
I'm sure I'll use it here and there but right now with so much content to reabsorb I'll just go organically as much as I can while not hamstringing myself on time gated stuff (got Tailor and Artificer to 500 so doing my 4 ascended crafts daily now).
I had seen it mentioned on some post or another and downloaded it yesterday trying to make sense of some of the meta chains etc.
Didn't help much at the time so I'll just relearn the game.
Somehow I managed to do just fine at launch to first ascended items with only build calc sites for experimenting heh.
I should probably get the dps parser to practice rotations though.
Otherwise I have no frame of reference to my awesomeness.
I wholeheartedly agree, I loved it.
Was on the fence about staying, but after that map I was convinced Anet stepped up their game!

Summary: 
I mentioned before but I had turned it off halfway through.
