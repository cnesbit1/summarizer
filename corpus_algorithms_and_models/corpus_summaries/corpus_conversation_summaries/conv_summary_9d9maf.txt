Do you have a comment to make on the inclusion of a rape sac in your children’s book?
I already asked- crickets.
What the hell is a rape sack?
Way to play dumb there Eddie- you know exactly the reference.
There is no rape sack in our book.
Keep trying to attack our book.
It's rather enjoyable to watch.
It’s right here https://twitter.com/thetomzone/status/1024350219289485312?s=21.
If your sick mind wants to imply this is a rape sack, then more power to you.
Looks like this Ed https://twitter.com/thetomzone/status/1024350219289485312?s=21.
I got me a book it's as dumb as can be

And were writing to kids 'bout the rape sack

We got some scam sites, at least about twenty

So hurry up and bring your nest egg money.
Oh thin skin Brian, way to deflect and BTW I am not the person who originally pointed it out.
Your virtuous mind believes this specific page it is great for kids.
I suggest buying a mirror before you write to anyone regarding their "sick mind".
An anti-Trump children's propaganda book.
You two should be very proud.

Summary: 
There is no rape sack in our book.
What the hell is a rape sack?
Keep trying to attack our book.
