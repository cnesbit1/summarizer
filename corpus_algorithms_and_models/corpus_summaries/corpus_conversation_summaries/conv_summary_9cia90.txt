Happy trading  (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧.
Hello again!
It has been a long time.
I saw you offer a Vivillon pattern in another thread and went to check your spreadsheet once more :)

I want my own Vivillon collection in Gen6 and am interested in your Elegant pattern.
You are looking for Shop HA Fossils, right?
Hi Kodes!
How are you?
Sure, it'll be JPN tagged and I need a parent for breeding :) Yup, I'm after Shop HA fossils!
Sure, I can provide the parents, female and male if needed.
I've been slowly building part of my collection in Gen6.
I have most Shop HA Fossils there.
My Gen6 [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0jn8fmsGxyJWSioHateLYlEOENctKPm7FczgTZE708/edit#gid=1083617329).
Do you want to receive them in Gen6 or Gen7?
About my request, I'm looking for 5IV perfect Timid Scatterbug eggs in regular pokéball, one with HA and another with Compound Eyes as well as some extras, all in Gen6.
I can provide parents in such conditions.
I have a 6IV Ditto in X, so I only need a HA parent :) Gen 6 is perfectly fine!
What is your rate for the trade?
Also, I have a question with regards to your spreadsheet template.
Apparently some of the ball sprites are not showing up in my spreadsheet.
Do you know how to troubleshoot that?
I can still give you a Compound Eyes one to facilitate with that ability.
Ratio would depend on which Gen you want to receive the fossils, because gender matters in Gen6 and female fossils with HA are harder to come by.
Can do 1:1 if you want female HA fossils in Gen6 or 3:1 (me:you) if you don't care about receiving them in Gen6.
About the sprites not showing, yeah, there was an info post about it [here](https://redd.it/9ercd6).
You will have to change the link addresses manually through your spreadsheet, including links in 'Resource' tab, mostly related to ball icons and some pokémon.
Some shop balls weren't affected because most of them are edits I made to make them look better.
Okay!
I'll hop online in a minute.
I don't mind males because I'll be transferring them up to Gen 7 anyways :)  
I'm interested in Heal Ball HA Omanyte, Kabuto, Lileep, Anorith, Cranidos and Shieldon.
And thanks for the link!
&lt;3.
Wait a bit.
I didn't breed your 5IV parents yet, right now I only have my own for that purpose.
And you can choose more fossils.
I will go for 2 Scatterbug with HA and 3 with Compound Eyes if this is not a problem to breed.
I don't have easy access to Elegant pattern so I'm interested in more than just 2 eggs.
Okay, hmu when you're ready :D Since you didn't mention gender, I assume you're okay with either as long as they have HA/Compound Eyes with perfect 5 IV?
So, another 9 more HA Fossils I'm interested in are: 
  
* Heal Aerodactyl
* Nest Kabuto
* Premier Kabuto, Cranidos
* Dive Kabuto, Aerodactyl, Lileep, Cranidos, Shieldon.
So, I was having bad luck breeding your Scatterbug parents Saturday and now I have limited time, but didn't want to leave you hanging, sorry.
Will you have some time later today or tomorrow?
Yeah, I'm actually pretty free until this Thursday.
But I won't be able to do any breeding starting from Friday and the weekends because I'll be going for a 3 days 2 night retreat with my friends.
Are you still around to trade now?
I am now :D.
I'm back again.
I'll grab my DS and hop online soon :)
Ok, I'm waiting online.
Take your time getting the 5IV eggs.
I will try to have the fossils ready by weekend.
Okay :D The earliest I'll be available to trade would be this Sunday night.
Will let you know when I'm ready with the Eggs!
Do take your time with the breeding :)
Update!
: I have 3 HA Male 5IV Eggs ready~!
Please don't feel pressured to rush your breeding :)  
2nd Update!
: 3 HA 5IV, 2 CompoundEyes 5IV and 1 CompoundEyes 6IV ready~!
I'm interested in that 6IV egg!
I'm almost done with the current request, but I'm willing to breed 5 more fossils to get all 6 eggs!
Nah, it's fine :D The current amount of fossils is sufficient!
This is so kind of you :)

I finished breeding the fossils and have some time to trade for the next 4 hours.
Wonderful!
I'll hop online soon :D.
Thanks for the trade :)
Thank you very much for this trade!

I have most Shop HA Fossils there.

I can provide parents in such conditions.
I will try to have the fossils ready by weekend.
