Original Response: 
The accuser has taken a polygraph, which detected no deception, and folks on the right still refuse to believe her.
Why aren't they calling for Kavanaugh to pass a polygraph?
Oh, right... because privileged white men are rarely held accountable for their actions.
Especially actions involving abusing women.

Can I just point out that part of your basis for your belief appears to be based on a prejudice towards his race gender and socioeconomic status and that this sub didn’t always stand for that?
“Didn’t always..” is the main point here.
Eventually everything turns into an echo chamber full of hate for everything.

Relevant username.
No that isn't true.
People here don't hate everything.
They love abortion.

It's the subreddit life cycle.
Be great, attract too much attention, quickly become popular with people who don't get it, the spirit dies.
Monumentally ignorant post...
I'm unsubbing.
I mean dude, you said it.
You offer a varied perspective on abortion here and you’re cast down quick.
I mean I didnt actually criticize or support abortion.
I just pointed out that this subreddit is extremely pro abortion.
Which is unquestionable.
That “you” was a general reference to anyone.
Ah I see.
Fair enough.
If anyone interested, the polygraph report has been released....

2 questions were asked:

1.
Is any part of your statement false.
2.
Did you make up any part of your statement.
That seems like a poor way to establish credibility with a polygraph.
:/
I don’t think it establishes credibility at all.
Wow, I need to read on this to verify but if that's true it really puts a damper on the "she took a polygraph so he's guilty" narrative.
Yup, that’s out now IMO.
The thing is, the results don't matter.
Well they do, the results matter that she was found to be not lying on the polygraph.
The validity of the test doesn't matter.
The headline "accuser voluntarily takes polygraph and passes" matters because its clickbait and is easily used to push a narrative.
It matters because titles like the one to this post can easily leverage the average person's ignorance and prey upon their predisposed notions of rampant institutionalized sexism as well as their pre-existing biases against any one connected with the president.
It never should have been relevant, polygraphs are useless.

It doesn’t.
It’s just to gain public support like OP’s post.
Smh.
Yeah, but that's like.....extra useless.
Two questions??????
Comeon man!!!
That is EXTREME VETTING!!!!
has to be credible LMAO.
Wow, those are GREAT questions that really make it seem like the test would be a solid piece of testimony /S.
@jmtyndall - you hit the nail on the head.
What you're referring to is officially known in the profession of psychology as "implicit bias" and every human has it.
Your own personal implicit bias is based on all of your lifelong experiences, observations, and it changes constantly based on what you continue to observe.
It's deep rooted and a great majority of time you have no idea it's there affecting your thoughts and trends, EVEN WHEN you're ACTIVELY TRYING to be "unbiased."
There's some credibility that we may be able to change and control it somewhat, but that's not entirely substantiated.
The thing is the media companies all KNOW this truth about implicit bias and play to it purposely; it sells headlines and rents eyeballs better for advertising!!
My credibility?
My wife is an executive for a very large statistical analysis company that feeds the advertising industry and she sees first hand the push that "clients" want to force data to match a preconceived notion they have or want to sell.
It's a shit show and you're in the center of it.
Let me tell you this... no matter what "side" you view this from, STOP USING ALL SOCIAL MEDIA (including Reddit - see those ads???).
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, tinder, blah, blah, etc, etc... they're all fucking evil and only care about one thing - monetization of the u$er.
$$$
