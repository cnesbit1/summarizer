Original Response: 
This is not a question regarding the existence of god, but rather the utility of his belief.
Proponents of religion often claim without god there is no possibility of free will.

 To be frank, I don't find "free will"'s existence or lack thereof relevant, but I'm curious why people feel a higher power grants free will.
&amp;#x200B;

Why is a higher power necessary for the possibility of free will.
Why would his existence grant free will?
Why do we assume that his existence wouldn't render free will impossible?
Why is "is there a higher power?"
relevant to "is there free will"?
&amp;#x200B;

My view?
&amp;#x200B;

The Existence of a Higher Power isn't relevant to Free Will as A higher Power is equally capable of providing circumstances that define our decisions as say, genetics.
If there happens to be a factor which is not the result of known circumstances, we have no reason to think the cause would be a higher power as opposed to other unexplained phenomenon.

Feel free to disagree.

Summary: 
relevant to "is there free will"?
