Original Response: 
Only if you care about the price this year.
Me, I don't care.
Not this year, and not next year either.
crypto must be very engaging to you.
Hah everything I buy turns to crap.
I've been buying all through the 8000s, down to the 7000s, and now through the 6000s.
I don't care about this year's prices because they're irrelevant.
When it's breaking new all time highs, it won't matter that I couldn't time the bottom to save my life this year.
I hear you bro I had buy orders set at $6500 and $6200 and cancelled them on Thursday and bought at $7025... lone behold later that night I look at the price is at $6345 then fast forward to yesterday at $6150 I was HEATED!
Then I realized I am HODLing for years and those hundreds of dollars will mean Fuck All in the end!
I think it will turn out that way.
Perspective from the top will be alright.
Across this year, seeing every filled order just diving...well, that's just the price we gotta pay.
ðŸ’¯.
Lmk what you gonna buy next so I dont.
not relevant to you because you don't know how to trade lol.
Lo* and behold.
Yeah thanks Miss Frizzle it was an autocorrect I didnâ€™t care to change.
Lol loved that book series and tv show, sorry I canâ€™t help my grammar Touretteâ€™s.
Lol youâ€™re all good I was just giving you shit!
Haha I have a grammar nazi cousin who will be right on your ass for any tiny mistake so Iâ€™m used to it ðŸ˜‚.

Give every decision you make 2 weeks before pulling the trigger.
