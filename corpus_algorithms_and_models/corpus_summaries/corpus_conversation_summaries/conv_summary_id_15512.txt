Love the hover hand....ha!
Where from?
Project X and Pitch Perfect I guess.
i don't know what it's from but I've seen both of those and it's not them.
I believe this is from a movie called "Vamp U"
You are correct.
At first I thought the other girl was Maggie Lawson from Psych, but after stalking around IMDB Lawson and Knapp have never been in a project together and a co-star in Vamp U named Julie Gonzalo looks a lot like Lawson and is the other girl in the gif.
Any good?
Never seen it, netflix doesn't have it available.
Oops, misread is at what's she from.
The clip is from Vamp U.
