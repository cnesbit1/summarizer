Original Response: 
We have not had capitulation yet.
why do we have to have capitulation.
Isn't it possible for a series of good news to start a new bull run without capitulation?
I think it will go lower again.
But i start to get doubts that it will go much lower than the lows of 2018..
what is capitulation for you?
You will always find believers in here and these are those who build the bottom.
But looking at the general market, selling off that alts drop 80-90% and btc 68% would mean complete destruction in the stock market.
Its called antifragility.
Bitcoin investors are used to  wild price swings so they are better equipped to resist big ones.
If you are only used to have very little fluctuation and one day you get a massive one, you will get rekted.
It just seems unlikely, given how parabolic it went in december.
Will "this time be different"?
There was no capitulation in 2015, and there will be none now.
This time will be exacty the same except instead of a $200 bottom and $20000 top, we're starting from $6000 and will probaly top out around $100000 sometime next year before the next "crash" (to $30k).
No, this time is not different.
It's a very predictable cycle.
You probably weren't around in 2014 during the bear market after the Mt Gox crash.
There very much was a capitulation.
Remember Peter Todd sold his bitcoins.
There won't be a bottom until at least a few bitcoin maximalists publicly sell.
you are probably right, but what do you want more than a 80-90% drop?
and if bullrun starts this year people will think "oh shit.
Bitcoin is real!
I won't miss out this time/I will sell the top this time/100x?
fuck yeah it can go 1000x"  

don't worry lol.

Summary: 
why do we have to have capitulation.
what is capitulation for you?
There very much was a capitulation.
