Geez!
Those readers do *not* like republicans.
"These people have the gubmint they voted for."
what.
Take it with a grain of salt, just about every online story on news sites have highly cancerous comments.
YouTube comments have got *nothing* on news-site comments.
It could be a story that has nothing to do with politics, yet down in the comments will be nothing but flame wars between liberals/conservatives and democrats/republicans.
Like, did you see that one comment calling us "toothless moonshiners"?
Talk about an inaccurate shot in the dark.
I'm convinced that it's mostly bigoted old people who make those sorts of extreme and/or ignorant comments.

Summary: 
YouTube comments have got *nothing* on news-site comments.
