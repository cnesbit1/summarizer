I'm originally from CC, but have been living in Houston for almost the last 20 years.........
well nice to meet ya.
how is Houston compared to cc for everyday living?
Houston is SO freaking big, it can easily take way over an hour to get to the other side of town WITHOUT traffic.
There's a lot more culture, diversity and jobs here.
Of course, it's still strange to me that the people up here don't really know the difference between Tex-Mex and real Mexican food.I think the things that I miss the most about Corpus Christi:Beautiful bayfrontBeachesCotton fieldsBayfest &amp; Buccaneer DaysSitting outside at Snoopy's, having a great greasy burgerWater St.
Oyster Bar.
well they canceled bayfest and c-sculputres ( few yrs back).
never been to snoopys.
always enjoyed pier 99 though.
looking to move outta cc in the next 1-2 yrs.
maybe outside SA or outside Austin...some place i can transfer too...
