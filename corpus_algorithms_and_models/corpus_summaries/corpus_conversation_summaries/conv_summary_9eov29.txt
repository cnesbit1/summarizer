Original Response: 
I work for a company called Colorlight, and we make controllers for big LED screens.
I have been a sales manager/tech support for exactly a year now, and would love to answer any questions you might have regarding the LED industry, how these giant screens work, or anything else you might be interested in.
I have noticed a big insurgence in LED related posts recently, from the jumbotron at a soccer stadium getting used for FIFA, or those little spinning LED fans type things.

I'm having a slow day, so lets do this!
&amp;#x200B;
What's the toughest part about the job?
Lack on knowledge in our customer base.
The LED industry is  exploding, and new tech is coming out every 6 months.
4K was big last year, and now we build a controller that does 8K (4 x 4k screens).
This explosion of tech, bundled with the still high cost of said systems, makes for a lot of people trying to get in on the new tech without knowing anything about it.
Makes for a difficult tech support call when they don't even know the resolution of their screens.
I figured it'd be some kind of consumer error :P

In that case what's the strangest or stupidest tech support call you've gotten?
I often get requests for impossible things.
But the dumbest so far was a guy who purchased hundreds of thousands of dollars of screen to resell.
He didnâ€™t know ANYTHING.
I had to teach him how to figure out the resolution of the screen, how to use it, how to plug it in, everything.
Like dude, you shouldnâ€™t be reselling something you have no clue about.
Itâ€™s going to come back on the screen company and the controller company (us).
Who would you say is the most rapidly rising player in the LED industry?
If the advancement is that rapid, then now is the time to invest.
This is an impressive level of dumb..
Either way, thanks for the answers and have a great day!
:)
Def.
It's only going to get bigger and bigger.
As far as rapidly growing, I would check out Leyard for screens and Colorlight (not publicly traded in the US yet).
Big players are Absen and Novastar.
Not sure if they are publicly traded in the US though.
99% of everything LED is all Chinese.
US options are Watchfire and.... That's about it hah.
Thank you.
Damn.
None of those are currently available on Robinhood.
ðŸ˜•.
Damn that sucks.
Oh, check out PRG too.
They are already massive, but the market is still growing.
Edit: [https://www.prg.com/](https://www.prg.com/) this prg.
Also not available.
Thanks anyways.
Ah, bummer.
Sorry.
