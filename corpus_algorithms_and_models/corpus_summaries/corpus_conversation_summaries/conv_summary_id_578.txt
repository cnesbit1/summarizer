It depends on your career field.
There are a lot of energy sector jobs there and some defense industry jobs.
Not sure what else, been a while since I was there.
I would do some job searches in the area and see what there is for your industry.
Texas in general is a good place though.
There are some cities I like more than others but man I'll take the worst Texas city over most other cities in the country.
Getting a job isn't the problem - I'd be moving there for a job offer.
More worried about social life and living situations!
