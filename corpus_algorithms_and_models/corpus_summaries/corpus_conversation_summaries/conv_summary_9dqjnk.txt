Yep...
This is almost certainly unintentional, and definitely racist.
It's a really good example of how racism can occupy our brains, and use us to teach racism to others, all while we genuinely believe ourselves immune.
i find it hard to believe someone could subconsciously make the change of skin colour, of the exact same characters, from black when they have disobeyed, to white, and then earnestly claim to not be racist.
when people are racist, they know they're racist.
and it looks pretty intentional to me.
if the situation was that a comic book of a bunch of bible stories had been made, and the white illustrator had made all the characters white, then one could argue they have a subconscious bias (though i wouldn't say it was a case of racism occupying their brains or anything like that).
but when you make the bad/sinful/negative characters black, and then take the exact same characters, one image later, and make them white, it's undeniably intentional.
&gt; when people are racist, they know they're racist.
I wish.
Lordy, do I wish.
Yes, some do.
But so, so many people manage to delude themselves into thinking they are not.
That's how the "I'm not a racist, but..." trope came into existence.
And there are **so** many Christians who are really, really racist, but (because they know racism is bad/sinful) are somehow convinced that they are not.
do you think we could all fall foul and end up doing what the person who made that display did, through unconscious racial bias?
i can imagine i could hypothetically make a comic book of multiple bible stories and make all the characters white, through subconscious bias, but to colour bad Adam black, and good Adam white; i can only speak for myself, but that's not something i could conceivably do, even subconscously.
it's an intentional choice, you're hunting for the brown colouring pencil.
you're thinking, "bad Adam needs to have black skin; now that's done with, i'll make a skin colour change and make him white".
no non-racist person would do that.
I think that people make subtle versions of this all the time.
Like, all over, everywhere.
Unconscious bias affects **everyone**, and the only way to stop it is diligent awareness.
but not something on this level?
because no normal non-racist person would do what this person has done.
it's overtly racist.
&gt;  no normal non-racist person

Doesn't exist.
Everyone has unconscious bis.
**Everyone.
** Some more than others, some quite fine with it (or encouraging it), and only those who practice diligent awareness can be free from it (and only while diligent.)
Which is to say that it's just another sin, in many ways.
&gt; because no normal non-racist person would do what this person has done.

You would be surprised what levels of "I'm not a racist" people can come up with.
so if you don't constantly check yourself for racist bias, you personally could imagine yourself making this display?
i don't believe anyone could subconsciously make this display, and be unaware of the racism they have to go so far as to select a brown skinned Adam and Eve to show negativity, and then switch the races of the same characters in the next breath.
i picked up on it within 0.1 seconds of seeing the display.
i'm not Superman.
i won't be the only one.
don't talk about the generic concept of unconscious bias, i'm talking specifically about this example of this display.
do you think anyone could end up making this display if they don't continuously remind themselves that black people aren't synonymous with sin and disobeying?
I can't see myself losing so much awareness that I could make this.
But I grew up in a church, and going to a Christian school, where there were a whole lot of "not racists" who would easily create this, think nothing of it, and vigorously defend it as "not racist" if called out on it.
These people didn't think of themselves as racist, but their racism was constantly on display.
I still know plenty of them; they have not changed much in the past 30 years either.
&gt; I can't see myself losing so much awareness that I could make this.
neither can i, therefore we're two examples of people who don't have a subconscious bias to the level that would lead us to make this display.
the people you're describing who would easily create this, are probably racist, and aren't the norm for all white people.

Summary: 
no non-racist person would do that.
when people are racist, they know they're racist.
