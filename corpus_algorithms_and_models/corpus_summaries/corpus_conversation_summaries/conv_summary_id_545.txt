Original Response: 
We already have two kitties and a dog, and with a baby on the way we just can't afford to keep him!
He wandered up one day and hasn't left.
He gets along well with the other animals and is super cuddly- would love to find a good home because I'd hate to send him to a shelter!I'll post some pictures in the morning, let me know if anyone's interested!

sorry, with 2 cats and a dog in a 1 bedroom apartment i already feel like ace ventura.
good luck!
Thanks anyway.
If you know anyone looking, or someone who might be interested, feel free to contact me.
How old is he?
I really probably shouldn't get a kitty cause I have a baby at home too, but I've been missing having a kitty around.
I've been thinking about maybe getting an older kitty that will be calmer around the baby.
Well, he's full grown but he's very sweet.
He can be a little food-greedy but I think that's due to him being a outdoor kitty.
You're welcome to come meet him and see if you want to give him a day or two trial!
If you end up thinking he won't work out, ill take him back no problem.
:)As far as his manners, he was well behaved the few times we had him inside.
He loves attention, snuggling, petting and is a very loving little guy.
I am sure he was someone's indoor kitty before he showed up.
Let me know!
