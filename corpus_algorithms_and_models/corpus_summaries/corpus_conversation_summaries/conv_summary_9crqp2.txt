[repost of same comment from that other thread]

i don't care for PJ Thum, and wish Kirsten Han would fuck right off to Malaysia forever.
If I were a Singaporean politician or member of the SAF I would never trust Thum or Han.
As an ordinary Singaporean I do not believe Thum and Han to be fighting for the interests of Singapore or Singaporeans.
However, this kind of 'Malayan' sentiment is not new.
LKY accepted that our separation is not cast in stone.

Former foreign minister [George Yeo considers himself a Malayan](https://www.amazon.com/Floating-Malayan-Breeze-Malaysia-Singapore/dp/9888139312).
That's not to say George and Harry are traitorous scum like Thum or Han, but that for all these people, especially Thum and Han, their past conduct, and the context surrounding their statements and beliefs provide important perspective.

I disagree with your first para, but I see your point for the rest of what you wrote.
People need to realise identity is fluid and constructed.
Just as a person can claim to be both Singaporean and Christian, they can also be Singaporean and Malayan.
I honestly don't know see what's the big deal, and why FB comments are rife with siege mentality.
It's like Singaporeans can't wait to start a losing war against Malaysia.
Rabid nationalism is a disease that needs to be addressed.

Bad analogy, you are conflating nationality with religion.

What religion does "Malayan" belong to?
No, my point is that identity is not exclusive.
Doesn't matter whether it's religion or nationality.

Then use an actual comparison?
It doesn't even work in context.
What about french and european?
Mexican and american?
Danish and skandinavian?
See, was that so hard?
?
Are you talking to the right person.
