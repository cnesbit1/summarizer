#THANK YOU!
Hey all!!!!
This giveaway is for some shinies and a few events!
It's got 2 parts, so be sure to read it carefully!
It's going to run until 10/3 at 12:00PM GMT+8 (midnight EST).
I've recently gotten some really cool stuff from people and have been helped out a lot, and I wanted to give the community a chance to say Thank You to anyone that has helped them out as well :) Here's where the 2 parts come in!
###Part 1 - shiny entries!
To be entered to win one of the shinies available, **tag someone** that has helped you out with something or that you've seen help someone out (free code, free tradebacks, advice, things of that nature) **with a short summary/thank you note**.
*Example: u/trollolly - you have some of the coolest giveaways and thank you so much for offering people events they can't normally get!
*

If you can link the thread, you'll get two entries!
**Please keep tags limited to members of r/PokemonTrades and only link threads to giveaways that have happened here**  

There's no limit to how many times you can tag, but only tag the same person once (so even if a person has helped you out multiple times, you may only submit their name once).
I'll list the shinies at the end because it's a bit long.
I also have some more to add [from here](https://pokemon-trading-spreadsheet.tumblr.com/?1P2GfP-WjGFcT3KjVCdevajmuclGEHIqU-aHrzc6vfb0#4) to it, but I have to organize those first - so check back later for more :)

____________________

###Part 2: Event Entries!
