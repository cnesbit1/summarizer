You boyfriend is allowed to want sex.
He is NOT allowed to hold your relationship hostage and make it a cold, chilly, miserable place because he's not currently getting banged.
He is acting immature, juvenile, and childish about it.
I've never wanted to have sex with someone who is moping about not having sex - have you?
I would recommend you tell him that the way he shows his displeasure is really unattractive and that he maybe bring up a conversation with you if he feels his needs aren't being met, instead of acting like a petulant child.
My friend's husband did this for 10 years.
They're divorced now.
That poor woman.
10 yrs of that feels like 1000 yrs, glad she escaped.
