Everyone except Dana.
He's too busy bangin out the anger at his boxercise class.
Anger's codename for someone's wife?

Gota pop the tomato somehow.
I'd lawyer if I were you haha.
He just fired the Social Media guy.
Word around the watercooler is that Dana paid Travis big bucks (that he needed) to watch him and Ronda get it on.
The man is all about power.
Would be nice if there existed, or someone with more talent than I could create, a version of this as a meme we could feed into Dana.

I haven't kept up with most of the drama in UFC, can someone give the cliffnotes on why Dana hates Tyron so much?

And also bangin fighters and ring girls that are not his wife.
Lol where does the "boxercise" meme come from?
I've seen it a bunch in relation to Dana.
I know he used to box, but is there a specific instance or is it just something made up to clown him?
he feels the ufc isint promoting him much he put on a very boring performance at 209 and 214.
He was a boxercise instructor in Vegas before he got involved with the UFC.
You got the whatsapp screenshots to prove it?
I thought it was Boston.
It was both but directly preceding his involvement with the UFC it was Vegas.
The mob ran him out of Boston according to him.

Summary:
