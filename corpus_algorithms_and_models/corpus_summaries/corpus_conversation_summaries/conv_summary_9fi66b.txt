[item] Looking for as many as possible.
Here's my Pokémon collection [List](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1TMyuVzBj6xSgPMRVs6DrXohk805vpDiQkaTEwde3LNc), I have all breedable combos.
I can also breed for stuff like 0 attack IV, 0 speed, hidden powers.
Trade ratios are dependant on what you want.
More complex stuff like perfect IV breeds will cost more/get you less.
I will reply as soon as I can.
Not breeding in USUM at the moment so no exclusive EMs available.
Could you do 

* Ulra [](/ultraball) Shieldon 
* Great [](/greatball) Anorith
* Net [](/netball) Tirtouga 
* Nest [](/nestball) Lileep

for 2 of each ball?
Edit!
: Sorry meant **Nest** Lileep.
Yep can do.
Any IV spreads, Natures or Moves you want?
IVs I'm not too fussed, and if it's no stress maybe Adamant on the turt and Anorith and whatevs on the other 2.
If they already have EMs just go with the ones they have :) 

Cheers!
Oh yeah, I'm guessing these are HA fossils too?
Yeah they are HA, I can do non-HA if you want though.
Nah HA is good for me.
Thanks!
I have to go out now but should have them done by tomorrow if that's OK?
Yeah no prob.
I should go to bed anyway :P

Talk to ya tomoz.
Hey, something came up and I'm going to need another day or 2 to do them, is that OK?
Yeah no stress!
:)
I have finished your Pokémon, please let me know when you can trade.
Free now boss!
OK, give me around 15 minutes and I should be ready.
K.
Coming online now.

Thank you for the trade :) Let me know if all is right and if you want anything else.
All good on my end.
You're a legend bro.
Thanks!
