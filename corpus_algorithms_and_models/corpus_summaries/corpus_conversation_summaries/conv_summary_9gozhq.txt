Original Response: 
Its close between: Joe Colborne, Eric Gelinas, Cody Golobouff, Patrick Wiercoch, Fedor Tyutin, Andreas Martinsen... 

Actually, just pick a depth player on the 2016-2017 Avs and chances are you are right.
&gt;Andreas Martinsen

That's the fourth name I see  that MTL has traded for goddamnit.
Remember when Colborne scored a hat trick in his first game with you guys and hype was real?
Good times.
Nate Guenin was worse then all of them.
Tbh I dont think he would be able to de-throne Gelinas.
That guy was brutal.
Remember when he left and people started crying that it would turn out to be a repeat of Byron?
I do and while I didn’t think it was a Byron repeat I also didn’t think he was so terrible he’d be out of the league already.
Was pretty surprised just how bad he was with the Avs.
Martinsen wasn’t that bad, that being said I’d take Sven andrigetto over him every day.
Lol you could make the argument for matt duchene, just considering how we played before and after the trade.
I’m not tho cuz I still like matt.
3 goals in his first game.
And then 1 goal for the rest of the season.
2.5 million well spent.
Greg Zanon?
Except Peter Worrell is the real answer.

Bad Stuart?
His only upside was this goal: https://youtu.be/BfhlkeNpAj4.
His Beard was fucking awesome though.
Fast fact: He used to send dick pics to girls in Quebec City.
I remember someone had called him "the general" and had a compilation of him pointing at guys during the game.
Don't forget Marc-Andre Cliche.
Fedor had a solid career as a reliable NHLer.
He was just on his last legs when Colorado chose to acquire him.
This made me laugh harder than any other comment in the thread except the one about the Aki Berg fanclub guy.

Summary: 
3 goals in his first game.
