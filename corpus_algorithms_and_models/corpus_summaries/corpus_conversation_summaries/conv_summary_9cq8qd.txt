Buys and sells on exchanges are not the same as real life transactions like PayPal though.
I know.. i wonder how much was actually used for a real transaction, not exchange volume.
Nope, still good  publicity though, could definitely help draw the attention of the general public.
Buying and selling wouldn't be an on-chain transaction, but withdrawals and deposits would be.
Yeah a better comparison would be to the value transfer rate on a stock/commodity exchange.
Good luck trying to figure out how much of that is actually used for real transactions for goods and services.
Likely a small fraction of it, but still some publicity nonetheless.
The general public still cares about PayPal?
Please.
&gt;Buys and sells on exchanges

Not on the blockchain, except for deposits and withdraws.
Yeah, PayPal is used more for commerce than Bitcoin is.
Bitcoin is more of an investment or vehicle for transferring money from one point to another, especially in large amounts and under the table.
Whereas PayPal serves just as a transaction service for small businesses (and charges criminal rates).
I don't know why people bother with PayPal anymore, it's becoming worse than Western Union.
Although I guess some don't even check the hidden fees.
They just assume that they're getting a good price when they transfer.
3 of them.
Buys and sells on the same exchange aren't on-chain transactions and won't be counted in this..... derp.

this is on chain data, not exchanges.
"Why not just add up the block transactions at the value when they occurred?"
Maybe people aren't smart enough to calculate the true value of throughput.
