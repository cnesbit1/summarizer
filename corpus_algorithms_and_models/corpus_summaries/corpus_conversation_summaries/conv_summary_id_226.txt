Original Response: 
His name is Cooper and he's a year old and about 20lbs.
He has a black collar with silver studs.
I'd appreciate any info if you see him running around.
He must have got out of the gate while I was at work, I just want to make sure he's safe.
Thanks reddit.
I live at Staples and Doddridge, will take a walk and look around for him.
Does he respond to his name?
That feels like a dumb question but I've met dogs that don't.
Yes he does.
He'll probably be a little frightened if you see him, he doesn't know people too well.
But if you see him give me a call and I'll be right over (361) 232-3230.
Thank you so so much.
I'll be driving/walking  around the area as well.
We found him!
