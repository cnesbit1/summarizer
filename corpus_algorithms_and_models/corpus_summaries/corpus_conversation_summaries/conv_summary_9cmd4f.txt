Original Response: 
My family was in the parking lot of the theme park, about to go in, and as we started walking away from our car, I noticed what was going on.
My husband knows that I'm the type of person who, if I see a woman struggling, I will help.
So he didn't even bother to stop me, and watched, as I called out to you.
"Hey!
Oh my god!
It's been SUCH a long time since I've seen you!
How are you doing these days!?"
I saw your confusion for a split second, then realize "this rando is trying to help me," and you played along.
We hugged, chatted a bit about life, and I pointed out where an employee was, just an aisle over.
I didn't want to cause too much of a scene.
As my family walked away, my husband turned and asked me who you were.
I said "No idea."
He replied that we acted like we knew each other for ages.
I explained what I saw.
How the guy you were with had grabbed your shirt and backpack straps, how he aggressively demanded the keys to the car, and how you were just trying to get away.
If you're a redditor, I hope you're okay.
I hope everything's worked out, and while I hope you don't have to one day, if you see someone else in that situation, that you pay it forward.
And if you're the asshole I got her away from, may your crotch be infested with the fleas of 1000 camels, and nary a person in sight to help you.
