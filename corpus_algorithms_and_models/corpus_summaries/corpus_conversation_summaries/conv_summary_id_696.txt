Figured Iâ€™d go ahead and post here, looking for a roommate thatâ€™s gonna be staying in corpus for the next year.
Rent is 470 a month, itâ€™s a 4 bedroom 3 bath, 3 roommates already and we just need a 4th.
Weâ€™re all guys, early 20s, itâ€™s a bit of a party house and we smoke.We live right next to TAMUCC and near where college housing is at.
If youâ€™re trying to find cheap housing and still have the college kid experience this is your bet.
Feel free to message me if interested!
470 is a lot of money for having 3 other roommates.
Not really compared to how much other apartments in the area cost and itâ€™s a home ðŸ¤”.
