Considering that the trailer itself showed us that I don't really think so.
It is also 3 months since that release.

There, in case you've never played the game.
I'm not talking for me, I'm always up to date, but my friends who don't have much time to play got spoiled hard.
You got me excited with that description!
Would people that haven't had time to play for 3 months actually spend time reading the patch notes though?
Especially since they tend to give us some information about the content of the story at the start of them.
They browse reddit and read patch notes since it isn't same as playing during work, don't know for everyone tho.
If you care about story spoilers you should probably skip the section titled "Living World" as it is only for story stuff since forever.
If someone haven't figured that out yet, I'm not sorry for them.
Path of Fire spoiled Season 3's finale.
Heart of Thorns spoiled Season 2.
Anet's not big on keeping spoilers for content 2 months+ old a secret.
If someone is rabidly concerned about spoilers for the living world patch they spent 3 months not playing, then at some point it becomes their responsibility to avoid info about the next patch.
No one has ever been forced to read patch notes on patch day, nor watch trailers.
You have to go out of your way to engage with that media, and it's a wise assumption that it could contain at least minor hints at spoilers.
Even if it didn't say anything so specific about Palawa Joko, those patch notes *always* have a basic story synopsis.
Yes I agree, but this subreddit always gave me shit if I mentioned Mordremoth's death 2 years after HoT and when I mention it for LS4 Ep3 I get downvoted, I just don't get it anymore.
Come on now, you're supposed to tell us if we put in a noun, verb, or something else when making mad-libs.
2/10.

OMG what Mordremoth died?
Why the fuck did you spoil that, my dude?

Summary: 
Heart of Thorns spoiled Season 2.
It is also 3 months since that release.
Why the fuck did you spoil that, my dude?
