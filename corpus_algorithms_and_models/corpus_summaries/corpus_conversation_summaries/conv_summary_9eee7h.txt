He got knacked plain and simple but I find it hard to take pleasure in someone's agony unless they're a cunt.
I'm not really seeing that, besides Snoopy Noodle Man.
He was literally being a cunt post fight claiming he was better just that Woodley was better for one night.
How can you be a fan of Rockhold and take umbrage with post fight comments like that haha?
I haven't heard too much disrespect towards Till, it was just a great performance by Woodley and a really one-sided fight statistically.
That was gross I mean if it was Colby Iâ€™d understand but Till has been a gentleman the entire time around Woodley.
A. Rockhold was given the opportunity to claim he wasn't trying, but didn't take the bait.
He gave Bisping credit.
B. Rockhold had beaten Bisping once, so, if he wanted to say, "I'm better, it can be argued."
Till has had one fight against Woodley and he landed not a single significant strike.
This is the most English comment I've ever seen.

I think people are seeing this more as a sign of Woodley's dominance than Tills shortcomings.

Maybe I'm dumb but who the hell is that?
AKA Snoop Lion.
Ah, ok. Well I'm calling him that from now on.
