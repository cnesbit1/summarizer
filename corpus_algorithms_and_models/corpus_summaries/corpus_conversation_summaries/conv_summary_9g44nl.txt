Original Response: 
So I guess Iâ€™ll start from the beginning.
My mom left me and my dad when I was 3 years old to go live with another guy.
My dad turned to alcohol and from like 11 I practically brought myself up.
I know my dad loves me but heâ€™s bad at showing emotion and he never told me he loved me or showed any kind of affection towards me.
Then at age 14 I hit puberty and suddenly I was known as the â€˜hottest girl in my gradeâ€™ and I was suddenly getting attention from guys everywhere I went, even guys much older than me.
I was young and stupid and craving love and I lost my virginity to a 17 year old guy when I was 14.
I enjoyed the feeling of guys wanting me and showering me with love and praise because Iâ€™d never had it before.
I began having sex with different guys and I would just do anything guys would want me too.
I couldnâ€™t say no.
I had no parental guidance to tell me what was right or wrong and I was just happy feeling loved even if it didnâ€™t last very long.
As I turned 17 Iâ€™d done it all, even threesomes and let multiple guys fuck me at once.
My friend and her mom intervined and told me this was no way for me to live and she let me live with them.
Her mom is my gaurdian angel honestly.
She paid for me to go to therapy and Iâ€™m currently dealing with the issues I have at therapy and itâ€™s helping me alot.
I still love sex but Iâ€™ll do it if I want too, not just because I want to feel love from a guy or whatever my messed up reasons are.
I want to put my past behind me and I donâ€™t act like that anymore.
But my biggest worry is no decent guy with ever want to be with a girl like me.
Iâ€™m always going to be open and honest with my partner and I want him to know about my sexual past, but I feel like if I do they will just think of me as a slut and who would want to wife a girl like me?
Is it possible for a guy to ever love me?
Would a guy date a girl like me not just for sex?
Itâ€™s getting me down thinking about it.
It annoys me because on paper Iâ€™m a catch, Iâ€™m in my first year of college studying law, Iâ€™m a good looking girl, Iâ€™m kind and friendly but I feel like none of that matters when Iâ€™ve done what Iâ€™ve done in the past ðŸ˜”.

Did you read?
I didn't say any church.
She needs a male mentor not therapy.
A father figure, boys need a father figure too.
A therapist can't give you that.

Read the rules.
This is a sex positive sub and slut shaming isnt welcome.
This is not the sub for you.
