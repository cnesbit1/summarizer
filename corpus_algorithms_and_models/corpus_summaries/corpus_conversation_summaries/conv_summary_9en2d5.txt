Original Response: 
I think #2, maybe Hughes is above him but I'd place him at #2.
I think people will let the couple of boring fights he had make a big difference on where they place him as a WW GOAT, but GSP had many many boring fights, and it has made no difference to his legacy.
It's close between him and hughes.

I don't think it's close at the moment, IMO Hughes is pretty clearly the #2.
Hughes had twice as many title defenses and all but 1 were finishes.
He also beat GSP and Penn during that time.
Woodley can definitely pass him with a few more performances like Saturday, but I don't think he has much of an argument at being above Hughes right now.
Hughes defended the title 7 freaking times man.
How is it close?
He held the title for 1577 days, over twice what Tyron has.
This is recency bias to its extreme.
Woodley has 3 + a draw.
One of which was a perfect style matchup.
The other as close as a fight can get.
Not to mention:
Decisionbot Woodley Thompson 2

He's not close to Hughes yet, let alone GSP.
There's probably nothing realistically he can do to overtake GSP's legacy at this point.
And he'd have to have a hell of a run to overtake Hughes, considering Hughes has wins over two real p4p all time greats and Woodley has zero.

He also lost to them.
Not close to Hughes is a bit of a stretch.
Woodley is beating people that the rest of the division doesn't even have an answer for.
Hughes defended for longer, sure, but he fought in an objectively less competitive era.
Fewer people fought, and those who did were visibly worse, especially at striking.
Also if you can think of a LW who would stop Tyron please let me know who that is.
edit: KO to stop because BJ choked out Hughes.
I don’t see how people don’t have an answer for Wonderboy, Maia or Till.
They’ve all been shown to be quite beatable.
After Tyron beat them sure.

It's close between him and hughes.
Woodley has 3 + a draw.
