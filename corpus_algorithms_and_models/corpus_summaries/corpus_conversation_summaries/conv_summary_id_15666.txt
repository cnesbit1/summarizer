Do you know where i can find the photoshoot for the rest of the girls in this quality?
Jesus lawnmowing Christ!
That resolution is insane.
I've been searching for UHQ photos lately, and from what I've seen, that photoshoot is the highest resolution set of actress pics on the entire internet.
go to google image search, crank up the resolution filter to 40Mpixels, and search on "Spring Breakers" - you should find more.
Are you serious with that res?
That's nuts, also looking at that high res is actually somewhat bad cause you see everything, LITERALLY.
Not bad at all.
I enjoy the non-photoshopped high resolution pictures.
Every skin imperfection or blemish just makes her look more human.

Are you serious with that res?
