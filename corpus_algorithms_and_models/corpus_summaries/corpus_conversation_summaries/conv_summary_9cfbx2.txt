Own up to it.
Can't I just pretend that it never happened??
?
Just walk out and laugh, go talk with your dad first, but don’t necessarily mention it.
Nah you'll probably look dumb.
Only way out is through brother.
Why would I talk with my dad??
?
Would it be better to talk with your grandma or a female relative?
Edit: maybe mention you’re a fucking girl.
Yeah, I guess you're right, I just think it's funny that most people assumed I was male in this thread.
Yes the stereotypical porn addict is definitely male, so no surprise there.
Or you could just not assume that she’s a guy.
There was literally nothing in the post to indicate otherwise.
Right.
My (and literally everyone else’s) mistake.
I guess guys just aren’t used to hearing something like this from a girl.
Say aloud: “Hey dad!!
You’re way too old to be jacking off to porn!!
Hahahhahahah right?
Right?”.
Happened to me the other day during a pre shower fap.
Wife yelled in- turn down the music!
I closed my phone utterly horrified.
Never spoke of it.
There is no way she thought it was music.
And also reddit dominatet by male.
Stereotypical doesn't necessarily mean reality.
Quite true.
I know many female masturbators, but even myself, when confronted with a genderless chronic masturbator online will default to a male.
Biases are weird like that.
