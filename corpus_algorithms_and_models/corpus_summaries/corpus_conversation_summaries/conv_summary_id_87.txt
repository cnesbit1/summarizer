Original Response: 
I just moved back down to Corpus from the Austin area.
I've been wanting to play some disc golf, and was curious if anyone around here knows of any good courses and may want to play sometime.
I'm not particularly good, just enjoy getting out and throwing a disc.
So far the only course i have played is waldron and its not bad but it is in desperate need of upkeep.
Tee boxes were unmarked, there was no map, and someone stole basket 7.
Is this the norm for most the courses in the area or is that just a few.
Any info would be appreciated.
