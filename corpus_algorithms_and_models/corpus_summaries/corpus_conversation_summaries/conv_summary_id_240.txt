&gt;we were hoping to see some of the perseid meteor show, unfortunately we weren't able to see any in the sky and only captured a few with long exposures.Now I don't feel like I missed anything by not making the trip out to PINS!
Beautiful morning sunrise shot, too!!
Totally jealous ;P.
Corpus can have some good moments.

Thanks!
We were really hoping to see some of the meteor shower but I think there was still too much light pollution from the surrounding cities :(
Oh hey I was totally there that weekend!
Glad to have some fellow redditors around.
