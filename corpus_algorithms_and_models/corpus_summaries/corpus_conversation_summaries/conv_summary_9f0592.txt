Original Response: 
This may be a bit of a rant and I apologize, but I want to get this off my chest.
I recently started trying out some dating sites and quickly found out how some men feel entitled to certain things.
The first example of this was when I matched with a guy who's profile said he was only a year younger than me, but in fact wasn't even old enough to drink.
I quickly told him that I wasn't interested in dating someone his age.
He then saw that as a challenge to make me change my mind.
He tried again a couple days later after no contact and I reminded him that we had already discussed this and I had given my answer.
After about two weeks of no contact, he messages me out of the blue trying for the third time to make me change my mind.
I had had enough.
I asked him if he actually knew the meaning of the word no.
That seemed to make him mad and instead of apologizing, his only answer was "whatever."
I quickly deleted him.
The second time was after I had finally made some connections with people.
We would schedule a time to either meet for a drink or coffee at some point.
It would quickly change from them being friendly to expecting me to send them nudes.
They would often ask while I was at work, and I would jokingly say "I'm at work.
I couldn't do that."
They would then think that badgering me about it would make me change my mind.
I can't tell you how many times I would hear, "Just go to the bathroom and lock the door" as if that would make me say "Oh of course!
Let me get right on that!"
The third time I had met someone who was only in town for a couple of days.
We made plans to get a drink and then see where it goes.
To make a long short, I quickly decided he was a catfish and really didn't want anything to do with him.
He would message me 4 or 5 times a day just asking to hookup RIGHT NOW or he was just off work and wanted to see me, or wanted me to send him nudes.
I ignored every single message.
I thought after the second day he would get the message.
Finally after not hearing from him for a week, I get the dreaded message "I'm free.
Let's hookup."
I finally had it.
I told him that I'm sorry but it wasn't going to work.
Instead of accepting it and moving on, his response was "Well at least blow me once" as if I owed him for giving my number out in the first place.
So ladies, or even men, does anyone have any similar situations or know why some men just don't hear the word no?
It definitely makes the dating life difficult.

Why didn't you unmatch him right away?
(Not accusing anyone of anything or what not.
Just asking the one question.)

Again.
If they're looking for that, good on them.
But you said "I'm at work.
I couldn't do that."
instead of a solid, "No."
If it's internet dating random strangers with no connection to you people are going to say/do things without repercussion.
Usually, those people are scum and you should just unmatch.

Why are you not deleting/blocking/unmatching these guys?
These are good questions.
1) After the first time he asked I figured that would be the end of it.
The second time he asked, I said no and did not get another response from him.
I quickly made more matches and it buried him.
I completely forgot he existed until the third time were I called him out on it and then deleted him.
2) I would joke first that I was at work and wouldn't do it.
If they asked again, I would tell them no.
This would usually make them try to make me change my answer.
I would then block them.
3) I had given him my number before he started acting like this so there was no way for me to block him since we were no longer on the app.
The only thing I could do was delete his contact info and delete the message thread.
It did not stop him from messaging me however.
I figured after not replying to any of his messages after the first time he would get the hint.
I only replied to him twice.
Once was to set up a time to meet in public before sex (which was before he started acting like a creep) and the second time was when I told him it wouldn't work out.
I only ask because I delete/unmatch my online dating matches as soon as I'm not interested, them being offensive makes me lose interest fast.
It doesn't take much.
But I'll talk to people who get harassed or lose interest and don't unmatch.
I can't wrap my head around it.
&gt;After the first time he asked I figured that would be the end of it.
The second time he asked, I said no and did not get another response from him.

Humblebrag.
:p 

But seriously, at this point he's got "nothing to lose" may as well throw a Hail Mary and hope for the best.
All it has to do is work once and it'll always seem like an option.
&gt;2) I would joke first that I was at work and wouldn't do it.
If they asked again, I would tell them no.
This would usually make them try to make me change my answer.
I would then block them.
Again, there is no repercussion for them to stop.
They probably had exes who were into the "chase" and liked "feeling desired" in that way.
I know I have.
It's probably worked in the past for them so it's a learned behaviour.
&gt;3) I had given him my number before he started acting like this so there was no way for me to block him since we were no longer on the app.

Most messaging apps, be it online or SMS, have block functions now.
I know the default Android one does but I don't know what setup you have.
I have an android, but I've searched everywhere and can't find a block option.
I have "people and options, archive and delete" which just deletes the messaging thread.
People and options &gt; Block &amp; Report Spam.
Thank you!
I've been searching forever!
Yeah.
It's come in hand a bunch.
I think I attract a certain type of narcissist.
I was going to say that I don't know what I attract but we all know.
It's creeps.
Do you realize they are narcissists right away?
I don't know how old you are, but once you hit your late 20s you realise that our generation is either really boring people, narcissists, or really single-focused people.
At this point I kinda expect them to be narcissists and then aim to be pleasantly surprised.
Dating is fun and I enjoying meeting new people, making good stories, and exploring places I usually wouldn't go, but I've kinda given up on finding something long term.
I'm in my mid twenties.
It's sad, but I've fully accepted that I'll probably be single if not forever, then quite a while.
You got time.
First all my friends had steady girlfriends.
I didn't care because I liked being single.
Then all my friends got engaged.
I laughed because I didn't envy any of their relationships.
Then my friends got married.
Little freaked because they were getting all domestic and forgot about me.
Now they're all having kids and I'm starting to sweat.
I feel like that now!
Whelp.
Be more proactive about it.
Find someone you like and chase him down instead of just "being available" for him like a lot of women do.
Oh I try to.
I try to let them know exactly what I'm expecting.
It's not ambiguous.
You ask guys out a lot?
&gt;that our generation is either really boring people, narcissists, or really single-focused people.
Nice generalisation I see why you attract those people now.
Why is that?
Shit sticks to shit.
Eeeek.

Summary: 
I would then block them.
