Go back to living your life on your own schedule.
Don't let her problems be your problems.
And: if and when she ever knocks on your door again, get your gear off quick as fuck and answer the door buck naked.
That will be the end of that.
Better to leave the gear on?
Nah, you're going for shock and awe.
Wait, what gear are you talking about?
I was thinking dog collar ... ball gag ... whip in hand.
Maybe we have different definitions of ‚Äúgear.‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

That's gold!
I was using "gear" in the Australian vernacular -- meaning "clothing".
But I like your interpretation much better, seeing as how we're after shock and awe.
What a hilarious image!
üòò.

If OP is in a house, not an apartment, then tell these nosy fuckers to go fuck themselves louder if they are jealous.

is it a townhouse, with a shared wall of another house?
if so, be kind of respectful of the share wall, except that should have plenty of sound insulation, and if its not a townhouse, then again, tell these nosy fucks to get bent.

I would call the company that made the place and tell them that you need better sound insulation between the units.
It might be sold as a "house" but to me, who has an actual house, it would be considered an apartment because it has a shared wall.
You might also consider putting up sound insulation yourself.
Hopefully you don't have any shared vents...
Drywall with resilient channeling to lower sound transmission helps.
Did this at my family home where one bedroom wall was shared with the bathroom.

&gt; Haha well it's a full house that shares the furthest wall

a shared wall to me means an apartment, not a house.
I own a house.
It has its own lot, and does not share any walls with anyone else.
In fact, in most places, if it has a shared wall, it has to be listed as an (x)plex, or a "townhouse" which is a technical way of saying "apartment".
Either way, I would just request the builder come back and put in more sound insulation between the units, or you could put up your own.
You should not have to re-arrange how you live because you have prudes for neighbors.

&gt; I think for now we're just trying to avoid her telling my mum any more about my sex life because i'm sure she's tired of hearing about it lmao.
I would tell your mom, the next time it comes up, to tell this prude to keep that shit to herself, because it only bothers her, and no one else.
Townhouse is not a technical way of sayin apartment.
Apartment is the technical way of saying apartment.
Townhomes are generally adjoined homes with shared walls but no one above, so either multi story or single story but still no one above.
A ‚Äúapartment‚Äù that you own would be referred to as a condo.

Summary: 
is it a townhouse, with a shared wall of another house?
Townhouse is not a technical way of sayin apartment.
Better to leave the gear on?
Apartment is the technical way of saying apartment.
Hopefully you don't have any shared vents...
It has its own lot, and does not share any walls with anyone else.
