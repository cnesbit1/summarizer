You can set an alert on TradingView to SMS/Email you when it happens.
Which moving average are you using?
Exponential or Simple?

Are you simply drinking it?
Or exponentially drinking it?
He is having it intravenously.
Let me know when you hit your 200 day moving average.

Drinking in parabolic waves.
But I'd argue that if it does, it needs to stay there for a while for there to be a confirmation.
&gt;We need to set a higher high and break the 200 day EMA.
&gt;  
&gt;A higher high would be above $7,400  
&gt;  
&gt;Breaking the 200 Day EMA right now would be; $7430.
&gt;  
&gt;Both are in the same price zone, so we shall see, if Bitcoin breaks both then it shall be looking good.
he is drinking it exponentially:

First 1/2 bottle in 1/2 minute

then 1/4 bottle in 15 seconds

then 1/8 bottle in 0.125 minutes

etc.
That MA doesn't cross super often unless there is massive volatility.
Go look at it over the history of Bitcoin and other assets.
He is drinking it asymptotically 

Just saying.
So what‚Äôs stopping the price from dropping after we hit $7.4k?
Nothing.
Why the 200 day?
Well it crossed above 200-day Exponential during the rally around 14-24 July, so I assume Simple.
I also really don‚Äôt see how crossing the 200-day anything is the standard.
If it crosses and stays above a range of long term averages, then I‚Äôd consider it a good sign.
No good reason for it vs a 190 day or 210 day other than 200 is a Schelling Point and many ppl watch the 200 day.

But he never truly finishes it.
A-sip-totically 

Just saying.
&gt; Why the 200 day?
Human psychology, to put it simply.
Well he does.
After exactly 1 minute of constant flow rate  the bottle will be empty!
TA is simply based on historical chart moves and what came next.
The 200 DMA is a good indicator especially in bear market breakouts.
Obviously many other factors are involved however it‚Äôs a strong indicator that the bottom has already been touched and a trend reversal is beginning.
Only after 6 confirmations, will I reinvest.
Your mother.
Good number.
Clean, trustworthy.
Good vibes.

Bitcoin was at 8200 last month.
Whose to say it won't go back up to 8200 and fall down again?
This EMA doesn't mean jack.
Technical analysis is a self-defeating bullshit.
When you know everybody is waiting for 200 cross it becomes profitable to wait for 199 cross.
That makes it profitable to wait for 198 and so on.
In the end it comes down to randomness and risk tolerances.
&gt;Your mother.
Let me tell you about my mother.
I'm expecting OP to announce it with a post.
‚òùÔ∏èü§ó.
That is not true.
Most reason use the 200 day because they use the 200 day in traditional markets.
Now the reason they use the 200 day in traditional markets is because this is how many days the markets are open on average per year...crypto is 365 days.
Simple.
Cool idea but 365 \* 5 / 7 = 261 week days a year.
Glass half empty kind of guy eh.
&gt; st month.
Whose to say it won't go back up to 8200 and fall down again?
This EMA doesn't mean jack.
It has crossed the 200 DAY EMA, and yes it does, during the last bull market it stayed above it the entire time.

Summary:
