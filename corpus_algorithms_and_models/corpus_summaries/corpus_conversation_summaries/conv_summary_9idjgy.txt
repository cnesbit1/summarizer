Original Response: 
It's a reality check for all those rushing to scale to infinity.
55% of nodes remain vulnerable.
(https://coin.dance/nodes)

And only 2% have upgraded in the past 24 hours.
At this rate, it will take weeks for chain split risk to diminish.
I've upgraded mine in less then 12 hr after the patch was released.
But is this making a case for PPAs and automatic updates?
no, it's not.
&gt; 55% of nodes remain vulnerable.
Maybe they are the people following the ideology of allowing, or even embracing chainsplit vulnerabilities, summarized by Gregory Maxwell's classic defence of UASF 149: "assume it happens?
So?
If malicious people do malicious things there will be some disruption-- same thing always holds."

Conspiracy nonsense  

Those who haven't upgraded are simply unaware of the urgency.
True, but is the cost for exploiting this bug really the cost of a single block's rewards?
A miner can't spend his rewards until they're at least 100 blocks old.
Exploiting the bug successfully would significantly lower Bitcoin's value.
So there goes 100 blocks worth of rewards.
Seems to me the true cost of exploiting this bug would be 100 \* 12.5 = 1250 BTC.
some people just want to watch the world burn.
Then why is the bug not exploited yet?
It's too late to exploit.
Most economic users have upgraded.
Define 'economic users' please?
Everyone receiving payments.
Automatic updates would remove consensus.
That you could actually make this comment makes me feel ill.
Because nobody wants to spend the amount of money required to attack bitcoin in this way.
how do i feel comfortable upgrading when it seems easy to deploy a client that could contain malware or bad code?
if u just say it's an emergency and bam everyone listens and upgrades?
how do u prove it, how do i make sure myself, i can't read code, how do i know if they are trying to sabotage the system?
Bingo.
&gt; Conspiracy nonsense

Which one are you calling a conspiracy?
My whole joke about the stupidity of UASF people, or the quote from Gregory Maxwell?

Summary: 
It's too late to exploit.
