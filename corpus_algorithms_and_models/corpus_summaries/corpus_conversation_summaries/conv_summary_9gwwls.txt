Original Response: 
What’s up today folks?
Today I’ve got a little pod system to discuss, from a vendor that has been polarizing this sub for quite a while.
It’s the [Smok Novo](https://www.smoktech.com/kit/novo).
The kit was sent to me by smok for the purpose of this review.
It’s a draw to fire, ultra pocket friendly pod system.
How well does it stack up to other pods though?
Let’s discuss.

#Pod Aesthetics
---------------------------------------

I really dig the color options.
I received the Red Cobra colorway, and I do think that it’s a bit bright, perhaps a bit flashier than I personally would care for, but the size of it allows it to remain covert despite the rather bright red exterior.
I think the dark blue color would have probably been my favorite option as a bit more understated in the presentation, but there’s something to be said for standing out from the crowd.
The body of the device appears to be a pair of plastic plates mounted to the metal frame which is exposed all around the edge of the device.
This lends a bit of extra weight, but more importantly lends itself to feeling rather sturdy.
I do enjoy the look and feel of the kit being as small as it is it makes for a very easy to use device.
It is, obviously, heavier than the analog cigarettes the draw is meant to emulate but can be comfortably tucked between two fingers just as one and despite the additional weight, it is distributed well enough to make it feel relatively organic to do so.
The pods are held in place with a simple gasket, no magnets, and manages to hold the pods well enough that the device can be lifted or held by the pod without fear of them falling out.
I have experienced the gasket sealing too well, and it will push the pod back up away from the pins.
Softly pushing it down again typically resolves the issue.The filling mechanism is also quite simple.using a small rubber plug that can be pulled free on one end to allow for very easy filling.
The pods are small, but as they are quite efficient the small capacity isn’t actively a hinderance.
The pods also are perfectly clear, without any tinting it is very easy to see your eliquid level which is a welcome change from some others I’ve tried which tend to be a dark grey color and make seeing the actual liquid level quite difficult.
The tip is, while relatively wide, remains very comfortable to use.
#Pod Performance
-----------------------------------

The draw is very clearly mouth to lung, not exactly the tightest draw I’ve experienced, but not near loose enough to inhale directly to the lungs.
The draw to fire mechanism also works well.
A soft draw, similarly akin to a cigarette’s is all that takes to activate the firing mechanism and the power provided to the coils appears quite adequate for firing with a slight ramp up but without an extremely long draw it doesn’t appear to reach an untenable amount of heat.
Given the small, 450mah battery, I expected the battery life to be a bit shorter than it is, but carrying it around and using it while driving as well as in between lengthier vape sessions with larger kits, I have as of yet not once managed to hit the low battery cut off despite foregoing charging between days relatively frequently.
The battery cut off occurs, according to the manufacturer, at 3.3v on the cell and is indicated by the draw indicator light flashing 15 times after drawing.
The pods also manage to last a fair amount of time in my usage.
After about 5-6  refills they are likely to begin losing flavor, though the juice I’ve been using is rather clean and I was able to eek out more usage than that before seeing any drop off.
As there are only a few factors in pod kit performance being satisfactory, it is worth noting that this device packs a surprisingly solid amount of flavor for a pod kit.
It compares favorably relative to other pod systems I’ve tried to date, and certainly can hold its own with relatively straightforward flavor profiles.
As with many other pods, the flavor does tend to wash out some more complex mixes, so sticking to a largely straightforward flavor profile.
In my testing I have been using a DIY blueberry and mint flavor that I’ve used in several MTL atomizers before.
The more complex a flavor profile is, the more of the nuance you’re likely to miss out on, and that has held true when trying flavors that bear a bit more complexity in my testing as well.
**Pros:**   
* Extremely small  
* Impressive flavor   
* Fair coil life   
* Fair battery life   
* Balanced weight   

**Cons:**  
* Could use a more subdued design option  
* Needs better battery life indication.
#Final Thoughts
-------------------------------------

I am actually more than a little impressed with this kit.
I have some reservations about Smok’s general product quality given many things we’ve seen in the past.
I cannot however say anything truly negative about this device’s performance.
For what I’ve used in the pod market, I can’t really condemn this for anything.
I do wish that I could find a more consistent pricing for the pods, seeing them vary from about $6 for a pack of three up to well more than double that depending on the shop you’re looking at.
If you’re comfortable taking a flyer on a device from Smok, particularly one that needs to be charged through its USB port, this could be a great refillable alternative to something like the Juul.
#Thanks for reading!
Nice review buddy.
Never had a smok pod myself but another buddy of mine said they make a good pod system.
Can't speak to any of their other ones but this one was solid.
nice to hear.
I've had so many bad pods lol nice to see more good ones.
Absolutely.
Pods really come down to a very small number of things and if flavor is bad, so is the whole thing.
yeah most of them are good devices it's really just the pod performance that sets them apart.
I've had a Smok Fit for about 4 months now.
I actually like it quite a bit.
I go through about 2.5 pods a day, despite not using it too much.
Besides getting juice in my mouth about 5x a day I really think it has a good feel and fits my vaping needs pretty good.
However, today it wouldn't charge and, after reading some, I took it out if the frame to find that the negative wire had detached from the charging USB.
As I was looking at it the positive wire popped off as well.
After some reading I found people saying that their products are not durable, and that malfunction is pretty standard for Smok products.
Then read that their customer service is total junk.
Maybe some folks here have had different experiences.
Please let me know if so.
I don't see myself buying another one of their products after this.
That's my 2 cents anyway.

honestly that sounds horrible lol plenty of pods that don't do that

it's hit and miss.
all vape companies have bad service save for a couple of exceptions.
smok is the best selling right now so we hear of the most issues with them.
It's kind of par for the course sadly.
Their products in general are just middle of the pack form my experiance.
not bad overall but not great either.

Yeah it's too bad because it's only my 3rd vape, and my first compact one.
I was using the Apsire stick type/beginner kits before.
They were great minus the size.
I just wish I could get a decent priced vape that is quality.
I quit smoking cigs and vaping seemed cheaper for a while, but it's not if I keep needing to buy new devices.
tons of decent priced kits cheap.
on an overall basis aspire, vaporesso, vpoopoo, smoant, innokin all do a great job at that.
providing good products at affordable prices.
Doens't mean all their stuff is good.
I'd recommend checking out reviews and asking questions to find what suits you that works well.
i'm always here so feel free to AMA.
Thanks, I appreciate the offer.
I actually just stopped and checked a bunch out.
I ended up buying the Aspire Spryte.
Seems good enough for $23.50.
I like that it uses the traditional coils, rather than the pods.
I don’t think those pods lasted more than about 5-8 refills, and their more expensive than regular coils.
I just trust Aspire based on my previous experience.
We’ll see in 3 months!
!
that's a good choice indeed :) and yeah it is a pod system but you can replace the coils in the pod so it's cheaper to replace but you can still buy spare pods to carry a 2nd flavor or extra juice :)
I had a Fit.
I got more juice in my mouth than I blew in vapor, the pods all leaked like crazy, and when I turned it upside down, it would auto fire.
Got a Smoant S8 instead, seems great so far.
I hear ya on the juice in my mouth.
I bought my new one today from the guy that recommended thenfit.
He was saying his didn’t last long either, but when he recommended it his was about 2 months old.
I asked when I bought mine and he told me.
It had a 3 month warranty.
It does at 3 months 2 weeks.
Go figure!
Mine came like that, sent Fasttech a video and got a partial refund, I didn't want to waste my time trying another one of them.
Even though I really liked the size and weight of the thing, the S8 is much heavier.

Summary: 
I actually like it quite a bit.
