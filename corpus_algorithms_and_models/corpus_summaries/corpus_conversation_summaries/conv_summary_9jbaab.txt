In 2006, Cheney shot a lawyer in the face on a "quail hunt" on Armstrong Ranch, Texas:

Back in 2014, a mass grave was found in Falfurrias, Texas:

(edit: Note, this is Washington Post -- propaganda media in itself, so they're soft-peddling this.)
They're about a 40 minute drive from each other:

Could just be a coincidence.
Maybe.
Probably related, in her book, *Tranceformation of America*, Cathy O'Brien explains how high level politicians play a hunting game called “A Most Dangerous Game” where they either hunt men or hunt little kids in a military enclosed wilderness.
When they catch the kids, they rape them in the office.
** Note that she was 12 years old at the time:

&gt; Dick Cheney had an apparent addiction to the "thrill of the sport."
He appeared obsessed with playing A Most Dangerous Game as a means of traumatizing mind control victims, as well as to satisfy his own perverse sexual kinks.
My introduction to the game occurred upon arrival at the hunting lodge near Greybull, Wyoming, and it physically and psychologically devastated me.
I was sufficiently traumatized for Cheney's programming as I stood naked in his hunting lodge office after being hunted down and caught.
Cheney was talking as he paced around me, "I could stuff you and mount you like a jackalope and call you a two legged dear.
Or I could stuff you with this (he unzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis) right down your throat, and then mount you.
Which do you prefer?
&gt; Blood and sweat became mixed with the dirt on my body and slid like mud down my legs and shoulder.
I throbbed with exhaustion and pain as I stood unable to think to answer such a question.
"Make up your mind," Cheney coaxed.
Unable to speak, I remained silent.
"You don't get a choice, anyway.
I make up your mind for you.
That's why you're here.
For me to make you a mind, and make you mine/ mind.
You lost your mind a long time ago.
Now I'm going to give you one.
Just like the Wizard (of Oz) gave Scarecrow a brain, the Yellow Brick Road led you here to me.
You've 'come such a long, long way' for your brain, and I will give you one."
&gt; The blood reached my shoes and caught my attention.
Had I been further along in my programming, I perhaps would never have noticed such a thing or had the capability to think to wipe it away.
But so far, I had only been to MacDill and Disney World for government/ military programming.
At last, when I could speak, I begged, "If you don't mind, can I please use your bathroom?"
&gt; Cheney's face turned red with rage.
He was on me in an instant, slamming my back into the wall with one arm across my chest and his hand on my throat, choking me while applying pressure to the cartorid artery in my neck with his thumb.
His eyes bulged and he spit as he growled, "If you don't mind me, I will kill you.
I could kill you --Kill you --with my bare hands.
You're not the first and you won't be the last.
I'll kill you any time I goddamn well please."
He flung me on the cot-type bed that as behind me.
There he finished taking his rage out on me sexually.

37 miles is quite a distance..
If it was 37 yards then I think we'd have something.

Waaaay too far for a Black Suburban to drive.
/s

Come on, man, you're just making this look worse.
Well I mean, you could drive a Black Suburban over a hundred miles.
What exactly is the approximate distance two points would have to be to each other to rationally assume that coinciding events are connected?
There is no exact distance, dufus, but within 50 miles is certainly suspect.
You're hilarious.
I hate Cheney as much as the next guy, but what exactly is suspicious about it?
The entire state of Delaware is roughly 50 miles wide.
Even the article you linked mentioned that a funeral home was just burying the bodies of illegal immigrants that were found dead from trekking across the countryside.
Cheney is undoubtedly a war criminal, but spouting this dime novel or rejected screenplay garbage only makes the rest of us look even less credible when we have serious conspiracies to discuss.
Hey maybe they were illegal immigrants.
Undocumented, nobody'll miss em.
But acting like 50 miles is just way, way too far to transport a body is just dumb.
You think they dragged them there?
Pretty sure the people here are saying that two unrelated things happening 50 miles apart doesn’t really seem to fit the parameters of a coincidence.
Hunting parties.
Graves.
Unrelated?
Maybe.
But I'd love to ~~see~~ perform those autopsies.
Rich old White guys going hunting?
Immigrants dying less than an hour North from the border.
STOP THE PRESSES!!!
You may be on to something!
The graves are explained in your own link.
&gt; within 50 miles is certainly suspect

Okay, great - so we'll assume you are guilty of anything that happens within a 50 mile radius of anyplace you've been.
A 50 mile radius encompasses 7800 square miles.
If I engage in human hunting parties and a mass grave turns up 40 minutes' drive from the ranch, feel free to knock on my door.
You really have no idea how guilty you're making him look right now.
Amazing.
Uh, how am I making him look guilty again?
By offering up a contrived, disingenuous defense.
And I thank you for it.
Wile E, bro c'mon.
i'm a huge fan of your posts, but name-calling?
don't stoop to an ad hominem attack.
you're better than that.
"Dufus"?
Hows about "Sillybuns"?
How does my “contrived, disingenuous defense” make Cheney look guilty?
I feel like I'm training AI here.
You could reason that separation between the grave and the "hunting ground" would be wise from a not-getting-caught standpoint.
However, Dick Cheney DID shoot a guy in the face and that wasn't enough, so who knows.
Maybe if the grave was on site that would have turned out differently.
&gt; You could reason that separation between the grave and the "hunting ground" would be wise from a not-getting-caught standpoint

You know what I'm always thinking when trying to hide my crimes?
Why not increase the number and size of the crime scenes so they will be impossible to completely control.
Logic would lead us to think they'd try to keep these things as small as possible to avoid detection.
&gt; but within 50 miles is certainly suspect.
No it isn't, case closed.
You think they'd bury the bodies in their backyard?
30-50 miles is perfect -- not too close to arouse suspicion when found, not too far to transport the body.
The problem is that the association is very specious at best.
Essentially the only thing you've got connecting these two disparate things is the distance.
It's far more likely that they're unrelated.
7854 miles squared.
That's how much area you get if you go from one point to 50 miles away in any direction.
To be assumed to be accountable for anything that happens in there is just absurd.
Sorry.
Hah we fucking nailed this.
Time to dig deeper.
TIL the only logical place to dump bodies is in your backyard.
Do you even know how big Texas is?
37 miles in Texas is like 37 yards to the rest of the country.
Really, come on now.
Also reasonable haha.
That's what I was thinking.
There is a lot of Texas- and 37 miles is nothing is parts of it.
TIL if you murder somebody you should bury them in your own backyard.
They'll never suspect that!
Far enough to not be connected to a crime scene, yet close enough that you're not driving for over an hour with a dead body.
I just am wondering how anything I say could possibly make Cheney look guilty.
The whole idea is absurd.
I lived in Texas for 6 years until March of this year, yeah I know how big it is.
37 miles is a lot bud.
Let me rephrase, if you travel at the speed limit of 75 mph it only takes 29.6 minutes to travel the 37 miles.
The nearest hospital to me is over an hour and a half.
Texas!

Summary: 
I make up your mind for you.
That's what I was thinking.
And I thank you for it.
