When: Every Tuesday @ 6pm - 9pmWhere: Gamer's Den, 6410 Weber Rd Suite 7, Corpus Christi, TX 78413What: We're a group of nerds that favor the more narrative side of RPGs, and we're looking to add a few new members to the roster.
Our primary staple is the F.A.T.E.
gaming system, but we also play Powered By The Apocolypse, Dungeon World, D20, and other gaming systems.
Sometimes we even do play-testing for new up and coming games.
If you're tired of micro-managing character statistics for math heavy games, or maybe you're new to gaming and want to ease in to the genre, then we'd love to have you stop by and try us out.
If you want to get a feel for the types of games we run, check out this podcast from the parent chapter: [The Gauntlet Podcast](http://gauntletpodcast.libsyn.com/)
As much as Id enjoy coming out, I work until 6pm down on the other side of town, but best of luck!
This still the same group that's been playing there the past couple of years?
Yes.
Si Felipe.
I have been interested in Pathfinder for quite some time.
April and I live in Austin now so they're down a bunch of people.
