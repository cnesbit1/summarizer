Original Response: 
This is a thread I see pop up, time and time again, and I'd like to take some time to clarify some misconceptions, as well as show you why you **should** be raiding, even once or twice a week!
Misconceptions
---

1.
**"I need a ton of time allocated in advance to raid"**.
Have you ever done a few world bosses in a row?
How about a map meta such as Vinewrath, Verdant Brink, Auric Basin, or any of the new LWS4 map metas?
If you've answered yes to any of these, then you **do** have the time to learn to raid, or complete a few if you're already experienced!
***"But what if I want to leave early?
"*** 

  Just tell them you have to go!
Easy as that.
No rating lost, no hard feelings.
People have to leave games all the time.
Remember, this isn't like ranked PvP.
***"What if I just want to hop in and out for 5 minutes?
"*** 

  Well maybe you're just not able to raid at that moment.
Do something much less demanding, like perhaps your dailies.
2.
**"I'll need to dedicate a ton of time and resources into gearing a new class and learning rotations"**

  Nobody in any training run worth their salt will ever expect perfect gear or perfect rotations.
Most people however, will recommend that you do try to get all exotic gear in whichever stat combination you will use.
Please note that sometimes it is far easier to get certain non-core stats in ascended than it is for exotic.
You can get at least one ascended armor piece per week if you max out your magnetite shards; but more on that later.
In addition, while you don't need to worry about rotations as a beginner, it is something you should absolutely **not** be afraid of, and for many classes it's **a lot** easier than you think.
Some classes with very easy rotations include: Deadeye, Revenant, Holosmith, Scourge, and to some extent, Guardian.
3.
**"I'll get yelled at if I make mistakes"**

  First off, everyone makes mistakes.
[Take Snowcrows for example](https://youtu.be/SMdIEx3NBt4?t=7m55s) :) Now, memes aside, **most** training and semi-exp groups are very friendly and welcoming.
You don't have to feel bad for messing something up, because chances are, someone else is messing another thing up as well.
That's totally fine.
It's a learning experience for all.
If you're in a training group, and you get yelled at, you're well within your right to leave them immediately or report them to the higher ranked members in that training group.
4.
**"I need very low ping"**

  This one is somewhat situational.
If your ping is so bad that you frequently disconnect from the game, then by all means, play whatever your internet will allow.
However, if you simply have some skill delay, then raiding is still possible to a certain limit at least.
5.
**"Raiders are generally toxic"**

  While it is true that people in challenging, high-end content tend to be more *on-edge* than the average person, I've met some of the friendliest people I know through raiding.
I highly advise looking away from PUGs if the toxicity is something that you can't handle.

* Q: [***"How about - i don't have fun playing classes/builds that are in raid meta?
"***](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9eu3mf/nonraiders_heres_why_you_should_raid/e5ro3q9/) (/u/SynthFei)

  A: This is totally fine and normal especially among players who enjoy the freedom and flexibility that GW2 offers.
In terms of DPS, many classes have a fairly wide range of alternative builds and playstyles which you may find more appealing, and which can get the job done just fine.
__However__ do keep in mind that if you plan to join a PUG, they usually expect certain types of builds, and if you carry your "dps condi scrapper" and expect them to be totally fine, you may be pushing your luck.
Again, this has an exception.
If your alternate build is actually doing well at its role despite the negativity, you can play whatever you want.
Also /u/shinitakunai had a [great response](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9eu3mf/nonraiders_heres_why_you_should_raid/e5ro9s7/) as well.

Thank you for reading.
I hope you found this information helpful.
Well, see... those rewards?
They're not very meaningful to me.
And the required investment of time?
Not worth those rewards.
But thanks anyway.
Well OP didn't mention everything: fastest way to get Legendary armor, at least for the first set (just 9 weeks of full clears, and it has unique skins contrary to PvP/WvW), dozens of weapon skins and some armor parts, and a pretty good gold/hour rate when you're reasonable successful.
I'm the same, the rewards don't seem at all worth it, and that's only if you succeed.
Anyone wanna elaborate on the loot rewards if you're someone who thinks Legendary armor looks garbage?
Experienced pugs do a full clear in around 3 hours.
Pure gold rewards, rares and exotics should be around 50 gold.
Add to that Bags of Gear (60-70?
not sure) and Champion Bags (around 20?
), opened on a bag opener with optimal level this is another 10 gold maybe.
If you want to optimize your gold gain further you can buy Ghostly Infusions/Benches with Magnetite Shards/Gaeting Crystals and sell on the trading post, another 25 gold per week.
Not sure if there's still a market for Guild Hall decorations.
Yap, the only reason i would ever do raids in gw2 is for the challenge of it i guess and gw2 has never really been my go to game for "challenge"...
But hey, im happy that there are people who enjoy that type of content and devs keep making it : ) I'll see ya all when the next living world episode pops up!
I think legendary looks garbage.
I started raiding a few weeks ago for the stat swap and rune swap abilities.
I play mesmer which has a variety of builds from full givers (so easy to learn and tank raids on this), Commanders+Zerker for T4s, minstrels for WvW, condi for cDPS in raids.
I don't want to carry all that gear all the time and I want to keep the same fashion wars when I change my gear.
Ditto.
It's like a 1% power difference or some shit isn't it?
Since I'm totally not into Fashion Wars 2 the rewards from raiding mean jackshit to me considering the time/effort involved.
That's a really helpful reply, much appreciated :)
Once I start actively raiding again and finish my Legendary armor I plan to transmute over it anyway.
I love my current outfit.
I just really want the flexibility of the armor set, especially as a Ranger player who has several wildly different play options available.
Yeah that makes sense, I tend to opt for multiple sets but I have no inventory or bank space most of the time so there you go...
How much do you think stat swapping is costing you per week in gold/mats, and how long do you think till your full legendary is done?
So you‚Äôre getting great Gold, unique cosmetics, a few special back pieces and trinkets, lots of raw loot and mats, exotic and ascended drops plus a currency you can turn into rewards including ascended, and the ability to work towards the Legendary set which can stat swap which is an awesome advantage.
About 2k gold and either some ez mode pve + some openworld bullshit, a decent amount of pvp or grinding WvW like a madman for a full set, but then you can buildtemplate everything.
That same FB can go minstrel, trailblazer, harrier, harrier/magi/minstrel mixed however I please, power, viper, grieving, ...
&gt;  and devs keep making it : )  

Tell me more...
If you want gear with any stats, raid rewards are great.
If you want gold, raid rewards are great.
If you want the skins, well those are just bonus which nobody uses anyways.
If you want legendary armor functionality, you get those too.
The biggest reward from raids isn't skins or fashion, nobody even wears those.
The biggest reward is getting a full ascended armor set every 3-4 full raidclears in magnetite shards, which takes maybe 12 hours over 4 weeks.
Frankly I find that very good loot.
Stat difference between ascended and exotics isn't worth my time/effort especially since after the first time through I was bored out of my mind come my second go.
Cosmetics, meh.
I only change my build when I get nerfed or an expansion comes out so legendaries simply aren't worth it for me.
I can make far more gold/hr just clocking into work for a couple of hours and then buying gems and selling those.
&gt; How much do you think stat swapping is costing you per week in gold/mats

Currently I have a fractal set of gear that's a mix of commanders and zerker as well as a set of givers for tanking.
I don't spend much to stat swap now as I can dial my tank/dps up and down as needed for the gamemode or team comp (i'm mostly just T4/raid now).
My goal is to get legendary to get back into WvW support and branch out into mirage as I tried it a bit in WvW roaming it was pretty fun.
&gt; how long do you think till your full legendary is done?
Well the first collection requires trophies/fetches for each boss in wings 1-4.
I just finished the Gorseval timegate (his trophy requires 5 kills, so 5 weeks).
The only thing stopping me from finishing the first collection is learning W2 and Xera from W3.
After that I think it's a bunch of ez fetches and gold, for which I probably have enough.
TBH I'm not sure how much longer but after 5 weeks of jumping right in on tank chrono, I'm just happy to be mastering the game and raiding with fun people.
In fact, I'm pretty much been volunteering into every open tank spot I can on the training discords even if I already have the weekly credit.
So Time to legendary &lt;&lt; time I'll keep raiding.
If you don't enjoy it that's fair.
Frankly the gameplay is more exciting than any other PvE by virtue of not being as braindead (aka slightly less "press 1 and auto-win because gw2") for me.
Converting gems to gold is nice but not particularly gameplay.
Also if you actually wanted things like legendary armor or ascended armor from there, you'd still be doing a lot of stuff i personally don't enjoy (leveling crafting, daily crafting bs, stat swap bs, ...)
Should also mention that you have a chance for an infusion on gorse (around 100g) and that chair in wing 5 (around 1000g)

If you dont value ascended gear, you can still salvage them, sometimes you can get these essences or what ever they are called (worth 10-1000g)
A general problem of GW2: rewards are trash.
if only we could stat swap trinkets fully ... so much more inv space, esp.
for mesmer.
I went from having 2-3 armor sets + trinkets in 160 inventory slots to 2-3 sets of trinkets and \~5 armor runes in 200 inventory slots on guard / ele (+ holo now).
Frankly it leaves me much more space, and templates make swapping pretty quick too.
Now if only we'd received any kind of new exciting gameplay at a reasonable pace, it'd be also worth to play.
Not playing fashionwars has its perks; like being able to pump all rewards into convenience.
Personally I do raids for the social aspect first and foremost.
It is fun, pretty challenging content, that you can do with a friendly static group of your liking.
:) The loot is secondary.
I really enjoy the Xera fight, for example.
It has an epic feel, and some interesting mechanics.
Same for me.
Thank you for trying tho.
Also as long as the raiding content is released so far apart I so no reason to get excited over raiding in general.
Legendary can be also acquired from WvW.
Well, let's look at them:

* **Magnetite Shards** - another currency, useless outside raids
* **Ascended Gear** - you can get it from many other sources, like fractals that are faster and easier
* **Minis** - if you are a mini collector, this is huge.
If not - kill-proofs are tool for the toxic part of raiding, friendly post mentioning them is already a problem
* **Fun and Excitement** - I can assure it, if your group is friendly, you will get a lot of it.
Taking down those big bad boys is really something
* **Heartache and Heartbreak** - Heartbreak should be the first position on this list, nothing hurts like failing on last 10% of boss health when it was your last attempt (even more if your guildies succeeded later without you)
If you think legy armor looks garbage you can just reskin it.
The ability to swap runes and infusions, as well as stats, is amazing.
and PvP.
I raid in GW2 but can't argue with that.
Rewards are...lacking.
I don't know how to fix.
&gt;Nobody in any training run worth their salt will ever expect perfect gear or perfect rotations.
Most people however, will recommend that you do try to get all exotic gear in whichever stat combination you will use.
Humm, the chair is a really low drop rate and you need to be able to finish dhumm.... and that s not something a beginer/intermediate player can achieve...

&amp;#x200B;

/u/BackIsBachus yeah you can have infusion :D.
You could always get it once from a non-intermediate group player in exchange for some currency and use your crystals to get it from Glenna :p.
&gt;The rewards don‚Äôt seem at all worth it

But how else are you gonna get that Knuckles mini?
Raids arent meant to be played for rewards.
Not everything is about the rewards.
Or shouldn't be.
I think the legendary armors look atrocious.
However the magnetite shards, specific boss skins and the liquid gold make up for that.
Guaranteed exo, rare, champ bags and masterwork bags and either 2 or 4g per boss depending on the wing.
That is guaranteed.
You also have a chance at a mini and ascended armor/weapon(some with unique skins).
If you're going for gold per hour, there are much more efficient ways, but if you like challenging yourself and getting rewarded for it, raids are the best.
Initially, it seems like no loot for lots of time, but once you get better at it, its significantly better.
Nike_DnT is the only person in the game who likes the look of leggy armour, bless him.
I re-skinned all 3 sets LUL.
Then what are they meant for?
RPG players play for rewards, they play for the progress and the time reward vs time invested ratio.
Raids are not gonna be fun when you're doing them for 200th time, skipping all the mechanics because they're vastly outdated now.
Reward structure is Guildwars 2's greatest problem, and why it struggles to keep players interested.
Raiding has always been traditionally associated with exclusivity in rewards and that's their appeal.
Don't you have to play wvw for like 3 dozen centuries to get the legendary armor there?
Or was that for the legendary backpack?
What rewards do you like?
Precision : that will take 40 weeks maximum assuming you cap your tokens every weeks (50/week)

less if you drop minis or a weapon (you need to salvage this one)

Glenna price : 2000 tokens +100g.
Why did you feel the need to comment then?
Not it will take you a century to get legendary armor via WvW and it looks even worse.
yeah but even then you can buy it yourself once you have the crystals, so a run would be on average worth around 20 g.
armor is rank 2000, backpack is lower.
Rank 2000 is only for the sublime skin, not legendary armor.
WvW grind is immense though even for a full time wvw player.
It's like 20 hours a week for months.
I actually have a relevant conversation that I took part in on /r/MMORPG just the other day about this exact topic.
I'll copy/paste my response from there into the thread for my opinion on the matter.
&gt;Genuine question, but why?
&gt;I'm sort of a "do a bit of everything" type player, but you should be doing an activity because you enjoy the activity, not because of the shiny thing it gives you at the end.
If you only enjoy getting the shiny at the end but not the activity itself, it seems odd that you'd bother doing it.
It's also a very MMO-exclusive type of mentality, since no one ever complains about "lack of rewards" in an FPS or Moba or even in most ARPGs.
&gt;My irl buddy is super crazy into mythic progression raiding in WoW, and is one of only like 500 guilds who downed Argus on mythic in the last expansion.
We've had this exact discussion before and he, more or less, agrees.
&gt;You do challenging content for the fun of the content, that being the challenge of t he content itself.
Gear is just to add a time gate to the content so you don't burn through it as fast.
It isn't really a "reward" you get, it's what allows you to, stat-wise, have enough dps/healing/EHP to do the fun/challenging content.
&gt;The gear isn't the goal, it's just something that comes with the content to make sure you're ready to do the next tier of content.
&gt;Anyway, to actually answer your question: T4/CM fractals and raids are probably the most efficient gold earning methods in the game.
If you're good and get a competent group you can finish your daily T4 and CM in maybe an hour(ish).
&gt;This will net you 30g or so, most of which is from vendor trash items that are immune to market fluctuations.
It also doesn't require a bunch of "processing" time like most farms do.
So, especially since the market is down at the moment due to over-farming of Istan, that one hour probably gets you as much as two hours of straight farming somewhere else.
Rather than repost the whole thing, I'll just [permalink](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9eu3mf/nonraiders_heres_why_you_should_raid/e5t47vl/) to my reply to the original comment.
[deleted]
Exactly.
To respond to the statement.
Serious question, not sarcastic: Then why should they be played?
Yes but for what purpose, in the OPs case it is quite obvious why they posted what they did.
In your case, what did you add to the discussion?
Easier to do Istan for gold plus I can drop in and out as I please, sorry.
Because of the content being fun and challenging; it's group content that should require high coordination and killing a boss should feel rewarding in itself.
That's why people do stuff like all gambit Turai Ossa and so on, there's no rewards for doing that.
Well, see, that was kind of my point.
Fun is a reward.
But I don't find it fun.
At least, not enough so to compensate for the work.
At least as much as you have.
And given the *amount* of discussion my comment has generated, apparently a good bit more.
This is completely true.
I simply said those rewards OP listed were not very meaningful to me.
Is that OK?

Your post would have been fine in the "why don't you raid" thread.
Putting it here just makes it seem like you have an axe to grind and want to complain in what is otherwise an informative thread for those who might want to.
It contributed nothing of value.
And I don't have fun when I do story or ls maps or open world, not everyone has to like everything.
This is absolutely true.
Never said they did.
And really, that's kind of the entire point of this thread.
I think the discussions prove otherwise.
Yeah thats absolutely fine but as i see it, and treat it only as a personal opinion, people doesn't really play the competitive modes just for the experience itself instead they are soooo much reward driven for some unknown reason.
I only played PvP because i found it fun.
Getting something else out of it was just an added benefit.
Yes I started and it takes multiple (I think 3 or 4) hours a day for slightly less than 4 weeks straight for a single piece.
Unless you already have a stupid high wvw rank but then you probably have the armor already anyway.
Pvp is much more time efficient, but not faster due to heavier time gate.
Both will take over 20 weeks total, but pvp requires less time per day spent.
Raiding beats both if you're good by a lot I heard.
Very well said.
if rewards are the only thing that can interest you, you'll only ever play the content that has the most profit.
&gt;ally want the flexibility of the armor set, especially as a Ranger player who has several wildly different play options available.
22 weeks if you max your tickets each week.
By the time I finished, I was so sick of the process that it heavily impacted the time I play the game -at all- since then.
I used to spend at least 2 hours a day playing, now I barely get my daily login.
How though?
people who don't like the rewards also feeling this is the right place to complain about a lack of rewards they like is still irrelevant.
It is like people coming here and complaining that they aren't getting PvP or WvW content, there is value in the topic.. Just not the placement of the discussion.
It is just whining here, the OP is providing good info for people who may not otherwise have it and put effort into their post.
They are incapable of changing reward structure and it wasn't a discussion of why people don't want to raid.
So people should segregate their conversations only into threads they agree with?
No... but they should be in places where they matter... like the "why don't you raid" thread.
Making irrelevant tangental staments helps no one.
So me saying "None of the reasons you list apply to me" should happen... somewhere other than the thread where the list appears?
