Original Response: 
LTL, FTP.
Format is chaotic because I‚Äôm on mobile.
This happened today, etc etc.
After a sleepless night that I can only chalk up to changing my sleeping schedule for my new job, and also because I wanted to watch Seinfeld more than I wanted to sleep.
I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life.
Oh, and I skipped breakfast because I‚Äôm an idiot.
At this point of morning I‚Äôve been awake for about 20 hours.
I started my new job at a green grocer‚Äôs a few days ago.
It‚Äôs a nice place, easygoing, solid clientele.
The woman who is training me is 35 weeks pregnant and going on her maternity leave tomorrow.
We‚Äôll call her ‚ÄòS‚Äô.
All morning S is talking to me about how excited she is to finally have a couple of weeks to herself.
No work, no baby, just her and her couch.
S started talking about how the baby felt kinda odd today, and I‚Äôm falling in and out of sleep while standing (about 28 hours awake at this rate) and start craving bacon and eggs.
I‚Äôm willing to give my life for bacon and eggs.
That‚Äôs unimportant, but I wanted to briefly talk about the last nice thing I thought about before chaos ensued.
We‚Äôre talking about how to cash up and close the store when suddenly S says 
‚Äúoh‚Äù, and then she says ‚ÄúoooOOOH‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not properly registering anything at this rate and am facing the register so I figure she‚Äôs bumped her knee or something.
More casually than you should EVER ask a pregnant woman, I say ‚Äúyou all good?‚Äù 

Silence.
‚ÄúUh, yeah, I think I‚Äôm okay.
That was weird.
Anyway, what you next have to do is - OH OH WHAT!‚Äù S has put her hands on her stomach and finally my idiot dial clicks from ‚Äòoblivious moron‚Äô over to ‚Äòsemi-aware dickhead‚Äô.
This lady is in labour.
I‚Äôm 23, and while I may be a woman myself I have no idea what the fuck to do so I start scrambling for the store owner who shouts ‚ÄúCALL THE AMBULANCE, I‚ÄôLL CALL HER HUSBAND‚Äù.
The sudden yelling from the manager, the contraction screams in the background, the bacon and eggs, and the customers witnessing the scene all set off some abominable reaction in my brain and the next thing I know I‚Äôm on the ground with the store‚Äôs owner leaning over me and instructing an onlooker to call a second ambulance.
Anyway, things are a bit hazy here.
I end up in the hospital on a drip with a doctor asking me a million questions.
Eventually I‚Äôm released with one of those hospital sandwiches and a prescription to ‚Äòrest up‚Äô.
Finally I make my way home, eat my sandwich, take a nap, and am now preparing myself for the embarrassment I‚Äôll no doubt face when I walk in to my shift tomorrow.
TL;DR: no sleep + no eat = passing out in the middle of your shift after realising that your coworker has gone in to labour.
Disclaimer: I don‚Äôt have any updates on S so if you feel like asking, I unfortunately can‚Äôt help out right now.
I just hope she‚Äôs doing well!
Edit: removed an unnecessary name.
UPDATE: Currently on my break, and happy to report that S and her baby are okay!
Baby arrived safely, and that‚Äôs all of the info I have.
UPDATE 2: holy hell I did not expect this to get any attention.
Quick FAQ:

1) This morning I finally managed to eat my bacon and eggs before work and didn‚Äôt pass out today.
The bacon and eggs were fucking amazing.
Never skipping breakfast again.
2) I live in Australia.
Ambulance cover in my state costs $40 a year, so the ambulance ride was not expensive at all.
Also, public healthcare is free under Medicare so the hospital stay, checkup, and sandwich were all free.
Nice.
3) Was Seinfeld worth this?
Probably not, no.
I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sleep regardless of if I was watching it but I definitely got a little too absorbed and it was 4am and my alarm was sounding before I knew it.
I dunno.
A woman going into labor in front of u can be a bit of a shock.
Don't think anyone will want an explanation.
They'll just want to know ur ok.
I definitely looked like an idiot and felt like one too.
My response was to start panicking and running to the office while yelling something about contractions.
I have first aid training, I forgot to mention that!
I definitely just went in to panic mode.
Just what a customer wants to face of a Monday morning while buying their groceries.
You probably had hypoglycemia due the lack of food and the stress that's normal and I also had some embarrassing cases like that.
I don't think anyone would assume that someone who panicked  and fainted/collapsed was an idiot -- you probably gave everyone a scare - they'll be relieved that your okay.
You can‚Äôt really beat yourself up over that, I‚Äôve had 2 sleepless nights in the past 40 days.
The first time Ritalin (and I wanna say hypomania) got me through it.
Second time?
(without Ritalin) by 6 PM 
I was about as functional as if I‚Äôd had about 7-8 beers.
I‚Äôm kinda beating myself up though.
If I had have eaten and slept like a FUNCTIONING HUMAN I wouldn‚Äôt have made someone‚Äôs labour story so chaotic or sent 2 ambulances to a small green grocer in the suburbs.
It was a shitty move on my behalf, and I should know better than to neglect myself of basic needs.
I completely understand what you‚Äôre saying but I was genuinely just irresponsible enough to put myself in hospital for a sandwich.
Hey don't be so hard on yourself iggysnoozes, we all make mistakes, not even that I think this was a mistake really.
Just a funny set of circumstances that lead to a funny story.
Everyone is okay at least!
Just try get some sleep next time üôÇ.
Eh.
You live and you learn, I doubt that lady will even remember what happened as soon as they drop her baby in her arms.
I have first aid training too and I froze when my brother had his first seizure in front of me.
I carried the guilt for a bit, but the only thing you can do is try to be better tomorrow.
Oh man, I‚Äôm so sorry.
My mum is epileptic and after a few years of living out of home I sort of forgot she was.
One time we were out for lunch and she started to seize and I don‚Äôt know what came over me but I started chuckling and told her to knock it off.
Thankfully something kicked in and I was able to act, but I definitely felt terrible for essentially ignoring her.
I hope your brother is okay!
Seizures are fucking scary, especially if they‚Äôve never happened to a person before.
Ah, Yeah I wasn‚Äôt really clear, obviously you fucked up there.
I was just trying to say that it wasn‚Äôt your fault that you couldn‚Äôt adequately act at that exact moment.
Sometimes we‚Äôre irresponsible and we fuck up, it happens.
But I bet that even if you can‚Äôt sleep, you won‚Äôt skip breakfast again ;)

I try to not go on my phone after 9 PM &amp; watch when I take my last dose of Ritalin, still can‚Äôt sleep that well sometimes.
All we can do is learn from our mistakes and I‚Äôm learning a lot lol.
Either way, today is a new day.
Time to start reshaping those habits to become the person you want to be.
It‚Äôs actually been studied and documented that driving while sleep deprived is very similar to driving while intoxicated!
So you‚Äôre probably pretty close with that last sentence.
As someone who's worked at grocery stores for a few years now, I'm sure your coworkers will be SO happy that something interesting finally happened.i dont think anyone will be upset at all.
I wish my panic mode was falling asleep.
Every Monday morning for me.
I'm a 40 year old man and I faint a lot.
Ride bike to dentist?
Faint while locking up, have to be taken to the hospital for dehydration.
Visit another city for a job?
Faint on the light rail to the airport, miss flight.
Go to work on Monday after fasting on Saturday?
Drop like a rock in the middle of the subway.
Usually I can keep myself from dropping long enough to get some place to gather myself, but I'm quite the sight when I'm losing.
Last Monday, I forced myself to stay on a mostly empty train because I had to take the previous two Mondays off due to feeling ill on the train.
I managed to hold on for long enough for the feeling to pass, but it did involve me making a bit of a quiet scene on the train.
You should invest in a helmet.
This sounds really unhealthy.
Why do you do this to yourself?
That is not normal and cannot be healthy.
Because I have to be at work?
It's not, but I've only had insurance for a week, and I manged to get in this morning without incident, but seeing a doctor about my blood pressure is on the agenda.
This sounds like what my grandpa went through before he was diagnosed with diabetes.
You should see a doctor ASAP, my dude.
I mean, I'm pretty sure fasting on Saturday can be excused if you faint the next day when you do it...
My parents are pros, my twin brothers have JME, some sort of puberty epilepsy.
He was the second one to come down with it, so they basically shoved me over and took care of it.
They are fucking scary though.
My brothers are fine, thank you, honestly, the medicine they're are has almost no side effects and they are off to college making their big brother proud of them every day.
Super chuffed to hear that!
Excused?
Do you think I'm fasting for some religious thing?
I'm an atheist.
And really that's only one data point.
I've also passed out after a night out with a lady friend, gone back to her place, had sex, got up the next morning, had breakfast, got on the train, collapsed.
I've done absolutely nothing, eaten healthy, next day, on the ground.
I've exercised, eaten healthy, drank plenty of liquids, collapsed, taken to the hospital, diagnosed with dehydration, soaked up two bags of saline in a couple of hours, sent on my merry way.
The hospital incident was fairly recently.
The doctors said that my blood oxygen level was low and that I needed to get more exercise.
So that's what I'm doing.
Glad to hear!
Sounds like you have vasovagal syncope.
Health first, wealth second.
Only people with wealth can say that.
People will bills and the potential to get fired because they just started work through the pain.
Sound like it might be more connected to motion than anything else.
Must suck living in the states where there virtually no workers rights.
Yeah one time I passed out at a large social gathering and had to be taken away by an ambulance.
I felt embarrassed but everyone was just concerned.
Maybe ...
Although it's happened *after* I've gotten off my bike, and I could feel it before I got on a train and so ... didn't.
But it's definitely worse if I'm on a train or bus or something.
First time it happened was when I was 17, and I just attributed it to exhaustion because I had a lot going on.
The first time my wife went into labor I was pretty useless from shock.
Her water broke and pulled the "either I just peed a little or my water broke".
We already had a bugout bag packed since she was so close.
I grab that and we book it to the hospital.
I also almost passed out when they gave her the epidural.
She was slouched over and I was basically watching her.
The sheer stress along with lack of sleep being it was like 2am made watching this fucking dagger of a needle being stabbed into her spine made me very dizzy and light headed.
I had to go into the hallway for a minute to gather myself.
By the second I was like "ok, let's do this."
Bonus, the hospital upgraded the maternity wing just the year prior to having our second.
For our first they just had this little closet with a Keurig, some juice boxes, and individually packaged slices of bread so if I was hungry I had to go out and get food.
By the second they had this whole convenience store like setup with fresh fruit, frozen meals, selection of teas and coffee, and more.
It was so much better.
It does, sometimes.
Top stuff, mate.
Proper chuffed.
.... I‚Äôm sorry.
I‚Äôm American and I think my brother and I heard that phrase on like Top Gear or some shit and have loved it ever since.
I say it all the time but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard it used in real life before, so I got excited.
I have an anxiety problem and not eating food and not getting enough sleep makes it worse for sure.
Passing out is my thing.
If I don't sleep enough, eat enough and have something anxious happen then I have to really fight it to not pass out.
Sounds like you just hit the extreme end of your tolerance so it's nothing to worry about but something to be aware of!
Thank god you said 'mum'.
I assume the ambulance ride was free.
I was thinking while reading, that it sucks someone called you an ambulance for what ended up being no reason essentially.
That would have put me in debt.
I know they're not psychic, and you could have any number of things wrong ih you, so in the situatiin it's good that someone acted for you.
It just sucks in the big picture lol.
Look up POTS.. postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.
It can be an easy fix.
Lots of salt and fluids (gatorade with a big, all American breakfast, golfish in between meals).
Keeps you hydrated and your blood pressure from dropping too much.
Also beta blockers can help if you get dizzy upon standing and faint that way.
But exercise is definitely key, try to build some muscle, especially in your legs.
I used to faint a lot at 6'0" 125lbs.
Being 190lbs now at the same body fat I feel like a new person.
Good luck.
I mean, it‚Äôs not like you knew going in your co worker would go into labor and you would end up in the hospital.
We all do stupid, irresponsible shit.
I'd suggest getting checked out for Addison's disease.
My suggestion also.
First off, see a doctor.
If there's nothing physically wrong that is causing the symptoms, then it's probably an imbalance in your diet.
If so the doc will probably tell you what I'm about to:

You need lots of protein and fuel for your body.
Carbs can supply energy but the carb rush/crash can trigger the same sort of low blood sugar that is what you describe.
Meat, legumes, nuts, and cheese are some examples of food with lots of protein.
Protein can supply energy as well, but it metabolizes slower, and will give you steady energy throughout the day.
Start your day with a healthy portion of protein.
Include protein in meals and snacks.
If you're trying to reduce the calories in your diet, drop carbs completely before reducing protein.
Try taking in more salt!
Gatorade is a good option too because of the electrolytes.
My husband had a bunch of fainting spells due to low blood pressure and once he started doing that (after doctors recommendation) he‚Äôs been fine :)
Definitely hypoglycemia but with the stress he definitely experienced a Vasovagal response, reducing blood flow to his brain and  causing him to pass out so suddenly.
You said you eat healthy?
But what does that mean to you?
What's your typical diet like?
For years I had a lot of health issues.
I saw multiple dietitians and nutritionists.
They all promoted that a healthy diet was high carb with as much whole grains as possible.
This turned out the be the exact opposite of what is healthy for me.
I‚Äôve had issues fainting too and it turned out to be low blood pressure - try eating salty food and drinking way more water than you think you‚Äôd need.
I carry around salted peanuts just in case i start to feel woozy and it really helps right away.
Dinner's my big meal of the day.
I usually stick with a protein, a starch, and veggie, sometimes two.
So something like a chicken thigh or a steak, 1/2 cup of rice cooked in low sodium stock or a potato, mashed, and some broccoli with garlic, red pepper, tossed with olive oil and roasted is a common dinner for me.
I'll sometimes add some cheese to whatever.
I'll also frequently have a salad beforehand.
I also make my own pizza dough from scratch with a 400g dough ball for a pizza .. it's a little too much for one, but I don't do it often.
I make my own ice cream ... heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, frozen fruit macerated with sugar and lemon and lime juice.
The recipes that I use call for about 50% more sugar than I actually use.
I do that about once a month.
Lunch is usually a salad from Chopt or a burrito from Chipotle.
Breakfast is a handful of jerky and a diet coke.
I also keep a bunch of nuts at my desk and buy bags of candy that I share.
This is a bit more recent though since I've only been at this place for two months, and the fainting has been going on for quite a while longer.
Last time I was at the hospital, they said that my blood pressure was 70 over 50 ...
I might have that backwards.
(damnit Jim!
I'm an engineer not a doctor!)
The EMTs said that my lips were turning blue and that I didn't have a choice about going to the hospital anymore.
Dont worry, without the muscle memory of weeks of advanced training and then real experience i'd say about 80% of people just panic and forget everything.
Nothing to be ashamed of, you're young, it's natural haha if it makes you feel better once my hemophobic friend fainted in mandatory first aid for the same reasons when they got to talking about the circulatory system.
You'll just learn from it and do better next time something happens!
An often misdiagnosed sign of Celiacs disease can be fainting, my friends mom went like ten years with no diagnosis and it was that.
Fyi!
Could you help me with my finances, you seem like you know how to manage investments.
Just more liquid is a good start.
Yes, you'll go to the restroom a lot, but it generally helps.
Gatorade is a waste if you want to consume electrolytes...
If Gatorade had a significant amount of electrolytes it would taste like shit.
He should get those electrolyte tablets that athletes use.
I‚Äôm reading this kinda anxious because I‚Äôve been really tired lately passing out at night in my chair which is really unusual for me.
Then I remember I‚Äôve gotten about 2-4 hours of sleep a night the past few weeks due to a combination of insomnia, anxiety, and just not wanting to go to bed before 11 and it all makes sense.
I wonder how long before I end up like OP passing out from stress and lack of sleep/food lol.
Yep, I remember visiting a friend who went into labour 4 weeks early whilst I was at her house.
It really was a shock for both of us seeing as we weren't expecting it.
I got the worst flush of nerves I could have expected and had to really focus on asking her what she needed and then subsequently calming her down because she burst into tears of "the baby isn't supposed to come so early!".
Followed by more awkward  "I know what I'm doing and can be helpful" from me when I felt like a useless plank.
She got picked up by her Mum to go to the hospital and I was left looking after her other kid and I failed miserably on working the remote to the TV so me and her kid watched the opening credits to Frozen on repeat for 30 minutes until my friend's Dad came to pick up the kid and left me in the house waiting for updates.
Totally surreal but my friend's kids are some of the most awesome that I know and I was super privileged to meet the new baby at one day old :)
How is jerky and diet Coke considered a healthy breakfast?
Also expensive...
Look into Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome and other forms of Dysautonomia.
Hope you are able to feel better soon!
I think once again, you're taking the single data point for the norm.
But anything is generally better than nothing.
And usually it's nothing.
Look, none of you are doctors, none of you are qualified, I don't care if you are qualified, as far as I'm concerned, you're a bunch of words on a webpage trying to convince themselves that they're a lot smarter than they actually are.
I never asked for assistance, I just chimed with basically "yes, falling down sucks"

So save your criticism and armchair diagnoses, because I'm getting tired of the second act of House M.D.
where House nearly kills the patient.
**IF** I was desperate enough to take the advice of a bunch of strangers on the internet and **IF** I were to go with "electrolytes!
It's what plants crave!
", then I would probably just chug some pedialyte.
No need to be so pissy.
Jerky is expensive, everyone knows that.
Then in another comment you're complaining about money.
Maybe you should see a doctor IRL.
You are unhealthy and obviously have problems.
That's a cynical way of looking at it and sounds like a shitty work environment.
If you pass out cycling and get hit by a car you'll have no health or wealth, so do yourself a favour for once.
No, what I said was that wealthy people can skip having a job to focus on their health.
I said nothing about not having money.
There's a world of difference between being unable to afford snacks and being independently wealthy.
Don‚Äôt feel too bad... I‚Äôm a 24 year old woman and I wouldn‚Äôt have known what to do either.
Additionally, this reminded me of the time I got hit by a car on my college campus.
I was crossing the street and a lady hit me with her Lexus.
I‚Äôm on the ground with a broken wrist and head injury, but surprisingly alert because adrenaline is a sweet sweet drug.
I jump up to get out of the street.
She pulls her car into the grass next to me (which could have hit another student but ok).
She gets out.
I ask her to call 911.
She hugs me.
She‚Äôs clearly freaking out.
I repeatedly ask her to call 911 to no avail so I push her off of me and a construction worker runs over and calls 911.
Then THE WOMAN WHO HIT ME PASSES OUT.
So there‚Äôs a crowd of students and construction workers forming and, just to be dramatic I guess, someone yells, ‚ÄúWe need another ambulance!‚Äù I‚Äôm in a great deal of pain at this point, so I ask someone who happened to be near me, ‚ÄúDo I still get the first ambulance?‚Äù

And that‚Äôs my story of two ambulances.
I guess this is more common than I thought.
‚ÄúDo I still get the first ambulance?‚Äù is the funniest thing to me for some reason.
I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you though, sounds NUTS.
Haha it is really funny looking back!
It‚Äôs okay, I mean it wasn‚Äôt fun but it could‚Äôve been a lot worse.
From what I was told in the many first aid and WFR courses I took in my youth, it is actually quite common for the person who caused the accident to go into shock.
I remember being told, over and over, that you should always designate someone to monitor the driver, both to montitor them for shock, and to keep them from running.
I‚Äôve never actually witnessed this: the only bike/car accidents that I responded to, the driver fled the scene before I arrived.
I‚Äôve never given it a lot of thought, but that makes a lot of sense.
&gt; someone yells, ‚ÄúWe need another ambulance!‚Äù I‚Äôm in a great deal of pain at this point, so I ask someone who happened to be near me, ‚ÄúDo I still get the first ambulance?‚Äù

Hahahaha, that's like something in a movie.
I got to ask the important question here...
So, did _you_ get the first ambulance?
I did!
And the EMT was very nice.
Before getting onto the ambulance I asked how much it would cost.
They said it‚Äôd be cheap since I was a student and it was the campus ambulance.
Once won the ambulance, I told the EMT my knee hurt and he asked if he could cut my leggings to check my knee.
And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you not.
These are very expensive leggings.
What would you do if you found out something was wrong with my knee that they couldn‚Äôt do in five minutes at the hospital after they make me change into a gown?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúWell, nothing.
I‚Äôll leave your pants.‚Äù 

So, I‚Äôm apparently budget-conscious even with a brain injury.
You can always replace a leg with a prosthetic limb, but you can never know when you'll find another nice pair of jeans.
You made the right call.
Yeah, might have been a risky move but we were minutes from the hospital and my knee hurt, but not so badly that I thought it was broken or anything.
I was much more concerned about my brain and wrist.
(Also, I was in college and Victoria‚Äôs Secret leggings are $50 and that was a lot of money to my college-self.
And also to my current-self.)
Are you ok now?
I am!
Thank you for asking.
That was four years ago.
I was out for the rest of the semester with my mom taking care of me, but I was able to return to school the following semester.
Graduated as planned, and I‚Äôve been working for a few years and getting my MBA part time now.
Still have some issues with focus as well as migraines a few times per year that started with my injury, but all things considered I feel very lucky.
Glad to hear you are doing ok :) good luck with the MBA.
this happened to me recently, although i didn't cause the accident.
once info was exchanged and everyone was dispersed i started shaking extremely hard,  and was sobbing for almost 2 hours straight.
the cop almost called an ambulance for me also.
Thank you so much!
As a college student right now, I'd love to get hit by a car.
A neighbors kid ran himself off the road and into a tree on his four wheeler a few years ago, trying to avoid our loose dog (no longer left outside loose again ever).
And I went into adrenaline overdrive.
I ran up to check on him and hoped or assumed my mom (who was just arriving home and saw what happened) was calling an ambulance.
She wasn't though.
I ran up and found him, he didn't know if anyone saw him.
I just needed to do something.
Even after my mom grabbed the neighbors and the moves him (stupid) I was in mental overdrive trying to figure out ways to assist or grab a first aid kit.
Luckily they caved and called an ambulance.
He was fine, no head trauma, knees healed up fine.
It was just a tendon t his thumb that got some damage and prevented him from a few seasons of archery.
I can completely understand getting overwhelmed.
I have run the spectrum of passing out from stapling my thumb to going full on adrenaline psycho when something like that has happened.
And I recently watched Heredity and I can completely see myself having a similar reaction to such horrors.
Yeah.
One summer the camp I worked at called an ambulance.
I didn‚Äôt know why at the time, I was just sent out to guide them down our dirt road.
I learned later that a girl had fallen off her horse while they were trotting around the corral.
The horse had stepped on her, but barely, because they are very well trained, and once it felt the kid, it didn‚Äôt put its weight onto that foot.
They called the ambulance because she‚Äôd gone into shock, and they needed to be sure she didn‚Äôt have any internal injuries.
The paramedics determined the bruise was superficial, and treated her for schock.
She‚Äôd just been terrified about being stepped on by a horse.
I can understand.
I remember horses were especially enormous when I was 8.
Like the way elephants look to adults.
Ironically, perhaps, the second time the barn called an ambulance for a kid, she‚Äôd lost part of her finger, but I don‚Äôt think she went into shock.
She did have to leave for surgery, though.
They replaced the barn staff the next summer, and zero ambulances were called.
I read something on here once (can‚Äôt remember which sub) that said that during an emergency, to give SPECIFIC directions: 

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, take your phone out of your purse.
Dial 9-1-1.
Tell them that we‚Äôre at such and such street and need an ambulance‚Äù.
Never thought about it, but it makes sense.
The real question is did you get free tuition.
[deleted]
To be fair, hitting someone with my car is something I've had multiple nightmares about.
The thought that I could just be at the wrong place at the wrong time with slightly slow reactions horrifies me.
I think that woman might've emotionally blown things out of proportion after failing to realize you were doing generally alright, but holy shit, what a scary moment for everyone involved!
I did NOT unfortunately.
That rumor is not true, at least at Texas A&amp;M. It was even a professor that hit me.
What a scam, guess tuition now costs an arm a leg AND a wrist.
Leggings aren‚Äôt pants.
So you and OP are both women in their early 20s and clearly neither of you have your shit together.
You should both feel bad!
My first and only accident I rear ended a lady pretty hard.
Thank God for the mom and her two daughters who pulled up on the scene.
I immediately got out as soon as I could, went to check on the lady I hit (who was crying and just said, "my daughter's new car!"
When I asked if she was all right) when mom shows up.
She gets me away from the lady, makes sure *I'm* ok, then tells me to sit tight while she goes to check on the other lady.
I must have been very out of it for me to seem like the first person to need help, I probably was because all I really remember is that part (probably looked like a damn lunatic or just in shock) until she comes back and asks me if there's anyone they should call for me (cops are on the way, one of the daughters called already).
Oh fuck, I'm working.
I need them to look up my work number because I have no idea where my phone is, call and explain, and the rest is pretty normal stuff if you've been in an accident.
Bit god damn, if she wouldn't have been there to take charge I could see going into shock or at least a panic attack while trying to figure it out myself.
Go mom instinct.
You‚Äôre actually supposed to, on an emergency scene, designate one person specifically to call 911.
You lady in the blue shirt, yeah you, get your phone and call 911.
Because if you just yell out someone call 911 there‚Äôs a high likelihood nobody will do it because they‚Äôll think somebody else is doing it.
So you are supposed to give people specific detailed tasks.
You call 911, you get a blanket, you find a first aid kit, etc.
I hope you sued.
You got hit by a Lexus.
Part of the reason is to help negate the diffusion of responsibility, where everyone thinks everyone else is going to do something, after all, there are so many people, right?
I'm from the UK and the thought that you would have to consider how much an ambulance would cost you blows my mind.
I'm so grateful we have free healthcare from the NHS over here.
Yes, this happened to my husband years ago.
He was cycling and hit by a car, driver was a kid who had probably just gotten his license.
He says it was hard to tell which one of them was more shaken.
I agree, it‚Äôs ridiculous.
I‚Äôd heard horror stories of people paying thousands for ambulance rides, even with insurance, which is why I asked.
Yes, we have an ambulance.
But what about a seeecond ambulance?
I'd pass out too.
Any college students dream is to be hit by a car.
She was adding up to costs of college and passed out when she calculated your tuition.
I didn‚Äôt get free tuition.
That rumor isn‚Äôt true, at least not where I went to school.
:(
Right lawyer could do it...

Summary: 
I do that about once a month.
I just needed to do something.
Because I have to be at work?
I might have that backwards.
I ask her to call 911.
I jump up to get out of the street.
I said nothing about not having money.
I hope your brother is okay!
I grab that and we book it to the hospital.
I guess this is more common than I thought.
I just hope she‚Äôs doing well!
2) I live in Australia.
I didn‚Äôt get free tuition.
I assume the ambulance ride was free.
I got to ask the important question here...
I can completely understand getting overwhelmed.
So, did _you_ get the first ambulance?
I had to go into the hallway for a minute to gather myself.
And I went into adrenaline overdrive.
I definitely just went in to panic mode.
And I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather you not.
", then I would probably just chug some pedialyte.
She was slouched over and I was basically watching her.
I felt embarrassed but everyone was just concerned.
I have first aid training, I forgot to mention that!
I was much more concerned about my brain and wrist.
‚ÄúUh, yeah, I think I‚Äôm okay.
Yes, we have an ambulance.
Passing out is my thing.
By the second I was like "ok, let's do this."
Oh, and I skipped breakfast because I‚Äôm an idiot.
One summer the camp I worked at called an ambulance.
For years I had a lot of health issues.
I also almost passed out when they gave her the epidural.
So that's what I'm doing.
I saw multiple dietitians and nutritionists.
When I asked if she was all right) when mom shows up.
I remember horses were especially enormous when I was 8.
I used to faint a lot at 6'0" 125lbs.
I was crossing the street and a lady hit me with her Lexus.
First off, see a doctor.
First time it happened was when I was 17, and I just attributed it to exhaustion because I had a lot going on.
You made the right call.
I definitely looked like an idiot and felt like one too.
the cop almost called an ambulance for me also.
Baby arrived safely, and that‚Äôs all of the info I have.
I'm a 40 year old man and I faint a lot.
I didn‚Äôt know why at the time, I was just sent out to guide them down our dirt road.
Before getting onto the ambulance I asked how much it would cost.
Luckily they caved and called an ambulance.
You got hit by a Lexus.
You said you eat healthy?
But what about a seeecond ambulance?
The recipes that I use call for about 50% more sugar than I actually use.
I wish my panic mode was falling asleep.
I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life.
The first time Ritalin (and I wanna say hypomania) got me through it.
I ran up and found him, he didn't know if anyone saw him.
