This is for the rural folks here in the Coastal Bend that use their service.I found this out the day before when my service started to bounce.
They got the first paragraph on their home page as a looping message.A shame, now I need to scramble to get TWC to come out and bury cable to my garage so I can set up a wireless relay to my home.They are on life support, and do not know when the plug on their service will be pulled.
The Rockport-Fulton area will be most affected by this, for most WiFi services do not have uniform coverage.Ave atque vale, valiant Stelara.
You were a bunch of good Okies to us Texans, don't let anyone else tell you otherwise.
