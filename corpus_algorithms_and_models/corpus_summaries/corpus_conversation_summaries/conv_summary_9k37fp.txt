Original Response: 
I legit cannot wait for this movie.
I wasn't really interested in the movie but after seeing the Alexandra Daddario set photos and these ones, they now have my full attention.
The fact that Alexandra Daddario and Kelly Rohrbach will be dressed like that and I can see it projected on a giant movie screen is reason to be happy.
Is she playing Pamela or Carmen?
She looks like a mixture of both.
Suddenly,  "Eric Prydz - Call on me" started playing in my head.
[Pamela](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCjW789Ih1A/)    [Ilfenesh Hadera is Stephanie Holden, Alexandra Paul's character.

Summary: 
I legit cannot wait for this movie.
