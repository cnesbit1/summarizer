Original Response: 
I don't trust his motives on this, but I do think a public holiday to celebrate Indigenous Australians is a great idea.
Just consult them on a date that is meaningful to them and the types of events that should be held on the day.
What do you think are his motives?
The only one I can come up with is that it's his way to resolve the debate because whether people like or loathe Indigenous people, who is going to refuse another day off?
&gt;What do you think are his motives?
Popularity to win votes at the upcoming election.
oh, I thought that was obvious.
I figured they were talking about something more subtle.

Why not?
It’s actually a genius move.
Wins super brownie points for everyday Australians, but knows it will take 20 years for the diverse aboriginal elders and groups to reach a decision on the date...
This argument is rubbish though because just about everything governments do can be seen as a way to win votes at an upcoming election.
Because after all, there is always an upcoming election.
Pick one, and then they can have a 20 year long struggle session 
to change the date.
Everybody wins.
Just damage control after his indulgent self loathing comments?
Get two protests a year to change two dates

We get two public holidays

You’re right, everybody wins.
probably his proven track record of being a colossal piece of shit, i would guess.
&gt; I don't trust his motives on this

no one does.
but a holiday to put the change the date saga to bed?
YES PLEASE!
