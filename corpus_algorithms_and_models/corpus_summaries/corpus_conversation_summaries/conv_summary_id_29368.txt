Original Response: 
Mmmmm.
I have a question, when does a model go from being just a model to a supermodel?
Is there an actual definition such as relating to fame or is it just a name that gets thrown around?
These days, it just gets thrown around.
People who are socialites like Emily ratajkowksi and Hailey Baldwin who do occasional modeling jobs are called supermodels.
It’s laughable.
The last great supermodel is Gisele.
And it seems that a model who’s besties with Taylor Swift is called a supermodel which is ridiculous.
Supermodel is a model who's turned celebrity, has worked in  haute couture, basically known globally.

Summary: 
These days, it just gets thrown around.
