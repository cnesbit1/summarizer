since you made a post earlier that you gonna buy both expansions on g2a, your account will be banned soon anyways, so it doesnt really matter, which class you boost.

in that case, I suggest to level normally, so you also understand your class, otherwise we will see another topic from you asking what to do at lvl 80 because you have no idea what to do.

Huh that's funnyâ€¦ 3 years in, my G2A HoT key hasn't been banned yet.
Can you define 'soon' for me?

Not everyone get this, but it's very high risk to get "wrong" key.
On G2A you never know who are you getting key from.

No it's not, especially not if you look at the sellers' reputations.
Sometimes seller is not the first "owner" of the key and he just resells.
In case of key for "normal game" he will probably offer you some refund and there will not be other consequences, but in case of GW2 you will get the ban for such action.
