How's Annie?
!
I admit, I had a crush on her after watching Austin Powers.
I know the feeling.
In my mojo.
Scrubs for me!
For me it was when she was on Scrubs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbQSXlL4Vfc.
Nice!
But too bad there is no high-res version :( You wouldn't happen to have one would you?
She has aged so well.
No :(
For me it was License to Drive.
When she's dancing on the hood of the Caddy in that little pink skirt.
I was 13 and there was no world wide web yet.
That scene was spankbank material for quite awhile.
