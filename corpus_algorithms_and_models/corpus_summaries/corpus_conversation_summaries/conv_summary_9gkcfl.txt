Another one lmao, these conspiracy theories seems every day more credible.
What about that is a conspiracy theory?
Wich connects with like 10 other conspiracys.
You didn't answer my question you expanded it.
Read the forum, read Qanon and you will get it.
Why don't you save us some time and paste in what portion of that source pertains to this sale or is it the earlier sale?
Cuse im working atm, i can send you a link to the Qanon forum in 8chan, but later.
Ya but wouldn't that be pages and pages of material and I would have no idea where to look and thanks if you post a copy paste later.
K, im gonna try my best :3.

Thanks  you trickster, I thought you had something specific about the magazine sale, I have found out this,  Koch money behind the 8 months ago sale, and the buyers are Democratic supporters.
I found that very interesting.

Summary: 
I found that very interesting.
