What's up with her eyes?
guys... her eyes are blue/grey.
when celebs are getting their pics taken at events like this there are many flashing bulbs which cause her pupils to constrict making her cornea and iris look a lot bigger causing her eyes to look like this, especially when the flash is reflected right where her pupil is.
my ex had eyes like this.
on sunny days her eyes would do this and i swear to snoo that she could stare directly into my soul.
She has such amazing eyes.
shapeshifter.
What is she from?

she plays Annabeth.
Penance stare...
