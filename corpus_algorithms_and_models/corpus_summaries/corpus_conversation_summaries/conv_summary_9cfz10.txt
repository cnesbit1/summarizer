Prioritize doing your job well but also be personable and don’t be overly serious.
Play the 'good cop'
Or the bad cop.. "nabei, can wake up your idea?
WHAT IS 1 + 1?!"
but what if the kids are unruly.
Unethical but talk shit about their school teacher so you become the good cop and they learn to trust you and work for your approval.
Can be friendly with your kids but draw a line between being a tutor and being a friend.

I’m terrible at being stern.
The last time I thought some of them I was playing country eraser for a bit.
My almond longan jelly dessert drop out from my mouth.
