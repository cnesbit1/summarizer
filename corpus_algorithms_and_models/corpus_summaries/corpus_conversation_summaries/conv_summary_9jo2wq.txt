Original Response: 
In the wake of Brett Kavanaugh's Senate hearings yesterday, I came across this quote by Sally Kempton, a well-known meditation/yoga instructor.
I thought it was a very timely and appropriate thing to think about today.
*edit: this went way beyond my expectations.
Thank you to everyone who has posted their views, both positive and negative.
I am trying to read all the responses.
**edit: Thank you so much for the gold, kind Redditor!
I've heard similar things explaining why men who are homophobic have such a big problem with gay men.
It's not so much that they mind two gay men doing consensual activities together.
It's that they fear that a gay man might treat them the way they would treat a woman.
It's okay (in their mind, not in reality) for them to treat a woman this way, but them being treated like that would be horrible.
No that's stupid.
Sorry to be blunt but that's stupid.
Uh, yeah.
It *is* stupid, but that *is* how some people think.
So your point is?...
Great contribution.

Probably that if you're going to call something "stupid", you ought to explain the reasons, otherwise your comment holds no value beyond some petty insult.
It's definitely stupid, but there are some men who feel this way.
(Not me.
What two guys, two ladies, or a man and a lady do together is fine by me as long as it's consensual and nobody is getting hurt.)
It explains the overreactions of many men when they're subject to advances by gay men.
I don't think many men think like that.
Some people have an inherent disgust at the image of two men being sexual.
This probably comes from the idea of imagining yourself in that situation, and is similar to thinking of other disgusting sexual practices, such as sex with an old person, child, bestiality, etc.
I'M NOT personally equating homosexuality with these things.
I'm just saying that type of feeling is where some of the homophobia comes from.
And PART of the reason they feel this is way is because they were teased or bullied as being "homo" when younger.
As long as "homo" is a slur, it gets associated with feelings of worthlessness.
Another cause for homophobia is actual feelings of homosexuality, of course, in which one is socially conditioned to thinking it's wrong (similar to above), and they react via social appearance of disgust.
The username was completely irrelevant.
And here I am, a straight dude who would love a compliment from a gay dude.
Does that make me a misogynist?

I think there is a fairly popular idea that "women could do it better" that's both ignorant and disconcerting when talking about leadership.
A ruling class will always be shitty, no matter which generally or race.
only robots can do it better.
I think you might be missing the point of the quotation; the problem is that men (allegedly) assume that a female uprising will result in female rule; "uprising" does not necessarily mean for the purpose of lordship, to usurp and/or concentrate power, or reverse the direction of oppression.

I guess that's the problem with the quote.
If it's open to interpretation you're basically just preaching to the choir.
