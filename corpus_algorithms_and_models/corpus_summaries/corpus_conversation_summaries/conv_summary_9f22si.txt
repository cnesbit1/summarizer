Original Response: 
It was a dummy spit.
(Literally.. with a smashed racquet)

Whatever.
Move on.
Edit:
Meh, depictions of dummy spits, whatever.
Also the rules of cartooning apply.
The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.
I have no idea how you think that using a traditionally racist caricature is acceptable, especially when that caricature fails to convey the desired meaning.
Is it impossible to draw an angry black person without resorting to this?
Is it impossible to represent the childishness of such an outburst from a black person without resorting to this?
Clearly it isn't, so why use a representation that many will find so offensive?
Why use a representation that is so obviously a racial distortion instead of something that specifically highlights the problem?
Regardless of his intentions, Mark Knight was wrong to draw her this way.
It is correct to call it out.
Is there any way that he could draw her that made it less racist.
Ask yourself that.
So if drawing ANY cartoon that looks remotely like her is racist, what does that say?
Get a life.
Nice counterpoint.
That's the best you could do.
No, that wasn't intended to be a question.
In your opinion, don't forget to add that part.
I attribute Mark Knight with considerable intelligence and knowledge of the world.
It is inconceivable that he was ignorant of the ground he was treading on.
&amp;#x200B;

He is smart and talented enough to have avoided the matter.
He failed to do so.
&amp;#x200B;

I have no skin in this game.
'My opinion' is based on the facts as I see them, and the logical consequences the action taken.
But it's still your opinion no matter how you try to spin the facts to fit your PC agenda.
Cartoon caricatures exaggerate features.
If Serena was a slim, small framed black woman with thin lips and nose  - then sure you might have a point.
But she's not, shes a large black woman with big lips and a broad nose.
Mark simply exaggerated those features as per the artist method he's employed for decades.
&amp;#x200B;
My 'PC Agenda' is non-existent.
I can see where you're coming from in regards to the features, and I will agree that he was likely honest in his intentions when doing so.
But the fact is that the result is extremely close to the old racist depictions, which are offensive to black Americans in particular, and he could have avoided that.
Exactly my point, Mark had no ill intentions and was simply covering a story how he has always done.
Serena has prominant African features, Serena had a dummy spit during her tennis match.
Mark drew those features and that event using the caricature method - if he purposefuly tried to misrepresent her features, then I would have a different stance.
Any one can take a picture of Serena and put it next to the cartoon, I would say if anything - Mark held back on the exagerations based on his other work.
The US had over a decade of Condaleza Rice caricature's that no one batted an eye lid, so I find this whole situation quite silly.
So because of a couple of cartoons from nearly a century a go in another country half-way across the world, black people can no longer be the subject of caricatures for eternity?
When did I say that?
Answer: never.
Just try to avoid drawing them in the vein of subhuman savages with sambo-like features.
Is this really that hard to get?
Would you also be happy to accept cartoons that were extremely similar to the overtly racist caricatures of Jews or Japanese during WW2, just because the subject had a number of physical similarities?
It's the only counterpoint that the post deserved.
I was just commenting on this earlier, if he’d changed or exaggerated TWO things less, it wouldn’t be an issue.
The hair and the lips.
It would still be an ugly, vaguely hateful cartoon, but it wouldn’t be quite so obviously blackface (for want of a better term) caricature

EDIT:
On closer inspection, he’s made the cheekbones look like a nose bone.
Can’t believe I missed that.
But what does a caricaturist do except emphasise the features that stand out about a person?
If someone has big ears, they'll have elephant sized ears in the caricature.
If they have a big nose, they'll have a jumbo nose.
Serena Williams has big lips, so what is one supposed to do?
Maybe not make them pink/red?
Maybe don't have her hair set in quite that way?
The work does not exist in a vacuum, and it is disingenuous to suggest otherwise.
Since the dummy in the cartoon clearly marks it as a dummy-spit, why not render her like an angry toddler or a baby?
There were other options that would have illustrated the point without drawing unwanted comparisons.
&gt; Maybe not make them pink/red?
The colour of lips?
What colour should they be, green?
&gt;Maybe don't have her hair set in quite that way?
It is the way gravity would affect the hairstyle she had during the match if she had jumped in such a way.
And sure this individual comic could have been better designed, it doesn't really look much like her for one thing, but the bigger issue is that you people are asking for a special exception to the principles of caricatures on the basis of race, and ironically claiming that that's the anti-racist thing to do.
Maybe her lips should be the colour of her lips?...
Also my observation is that most of "my people" would have preferred a rendition that wasn't a callback to Sambo-like cartoons.
Remember that a cartoon like this exists to make a point.
All this racism stuff clouds that point.
&gt;Maybe her lips should be the colour of her lips?.
You offendatrons would just say he was trying to make her look like an ape or some bullshit.
&gt;Also my observation is that most of "my people" would have preferred a rendition that wasn't a callback to Sambo-like cartoons.
It's not a fucking callback to Sambo like cartoons, it's a caricature that uses the principles of caricatures.
You're the one attaching the racial implications onto it.
Please don't call me an 'offendatron'.
You've been civil so far, it's beneath you.
The Sambo-like appearance \*is\* intended to evoke a primitive, ape-like appearance.
This is what I mean by sub-human, and the [pickaninny style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickaninny) has a history of derogatory and racist use.
It doesn't \*matter\* whether Mark Knight intended racism with the picture.
It is so similar to the racist cartoons that this is what people are now focused on.
* From Wikipedia: " An **editorial cartoon**, also known as a **political cartoon**, is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion.
...
They typically combine artistic skill, hyperbole and satire in order to question authority and draw attention to corruption,**political** violence and other social ills."
I would submit that, since instead of making his point it has stirred up all this argument over racism, it has failed to achieve its goal.
From a practical standpoint is a failed cartoon.
From Serena Williams' standpoint it is a racist cartoon.
Mark Knight says he did not intend to be racist, but you can't just draw this sort of thing and not expect it to be linked by anyone.
If apples looked like lemons on the outside, \*I'd\* be expecting citric sourness on first bite.
&gt;You've been civil so far, it's beneath you.
Flattering, but untrue.

Of course it matters, you're basically saying that as long as enough people arbitrarily decide to get offended by something then the author's intent doesn't matter.
Oh but it's only ever when people you agree with are offended though, right?
When's the last time anyone from the left has altered their behaviour, language, etc... based on people from the right saying they are offended?
And yet the right's supposed to fall right into lockstep and kowtow to the left's every whim just because enough lefties are claiming to be offended?
Why?
And by the way the comic was [nowhere near that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickaninny#/media/File:Picaninny_Freeze.jpg), what are you talking about?
&gt;	The US had over a decade of Condaleza Rice caricature’s that no one batted an eye lid, so I find this whole situation quite silly.
She’s right wing though so they don’t give a shit about her.
Haha yeah what a loser.
Making an anti racist comment online.
So much lamer than making a comment defending racism or disparaging anti racism, eh?
&gt; And by the way the comic was nowhere near that, what are you talking about?
The 'sambo-style' is a type of pickanniny style.
Sambo was actually a native american.
This is irrelevant to the point at hand.
&gt;Of course it matters, you're basically saying that as long as enough people arbitrarily decide to get offended by something then the author's intent doesn't matter.
I'm being more pragmatic than ideological here.
Assume Mark Knight made the cartoon with no racial consideration at all.
His *intention* was to highlight the dummy-spit, but the result was a lot of very angry people who felt racially vilified.
Many of those people have stopped listening, and won't accept any 'explanations' contrary to their initial perception.
The damage has been done.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

This is not really part of the discussion, but I actually agree.
The problem is that the social-right holds conservative values that can be quite bigoted against people of certain races, sexuality, gender, culture, nationality, or faith.
I would say that most of those are beyond the individual's control, and should not be the target of ridicule—that'd be playing the man, not the ball.
It isn't always wrong to offend, if the person is espousing certain well-regarded qualities while living the opposite.
Barnaby Joyce's little saga is a solid example: talking about strong family values while undermining them at every turn.
I am happy to agree that there are plenty shrill and deranged voices on the left being offended by every little thing.
Such people exist on both sides of the social spectrum and make a lot of noise that will often drown out meaningful discourse.
They will dismiss anything the other person has to say unless they completely agree with them.
The sane part of society can actually discuss whether an offensive thing is warranted criticism or not.
Criticisms based in race are not warranted, and that is what Mark Knight unintentionally achieved.
He fucked up, and the correct move would have been to acknowledge the similarities between the cartoon and the sambo-style and to apologise for the reaction it has caused because he had only intended to illustrate the childish and, frankly, thuggish behaviour of Serena Williams.
Instead he and the Herald Sun have opted for the more *courageous* move of doubling down.

You're just looking for excuses to hold a double standard.
Don't you think the social right believes that the left holds values that are bigoted against their culture, nationality and faith?
