Original Response: 
I pulled out bedore i came, but im scared.
I know, it was dumb, and rash, and it could ruin my life.
I don't need scolded, I need advice.
what next?
If it was recent, you could get Plan B for her at the store and that will prevent any potential pregnancy from happening.
yeah it happened about 2 hours ago.
that's what I'm thinking.
but I can't exactly dish out 50 bucks rn.
Does she have any money that she could help pay with too?
yeah, that would make it easier.
I am sure she wouldnâ€™t oppose helping out paying for it because after all she is the one who would get pregnant.
Also, there are other brands that are cheaper (22-35 dollars) than the 50 dollar one which you can use.
you are right.
how long before a plan B pill won't work?
cuz I still need to ask where she is at in her cycle.
okay thanks.
I just got the 50 price after a quick Google search.
Ideally within 24 hours according to my searches, but it can go even as far as 72 hours.
okay thanks.
