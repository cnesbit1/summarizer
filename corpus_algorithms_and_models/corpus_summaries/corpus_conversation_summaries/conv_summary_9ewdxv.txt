1.
Connecting an alt to a main is not doxxing.
No one in question has doxxed a mod.
Using an alt, as a mod, to troll the sub is soooo fucked up.
Pointing that out should not result in a ban.
WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?
(I watched as you scripted pass out of the sub for fucks sake.)
2.
Deleting comments that do not break the rules but merely link to the matter at hand is bad form.
How have no other mods seen or taken issue with this?
3.
Locking threads without a response is soooo very lame.
You can do better than this.
4.
When will /u/_passafire_ be unbanned?
5.
Why is everything some huge secret we arent allowed to know?
Everything is so hush hush ban ban.
I don't really care about Dong, but how is this the right thing to do?
Just secretly ban people and assure us the "evidence" is too dangerous for the public?
6.
Mods using post tags to intimidate and ridicule the user base is immature and annoying.
Assigning shitpost and Reddit Is Hard tags only serves to create an elitist attitude within the moderation team.
Your opinion on the quality of posts must come second.
That is your goddamned job.
Edit-7   to add a permalink to chuffy's alt being banned out of spite.
It is not against the rules to have alts here.

Seriously.
What the fuck.
I don't know how you plan to maintain any form of credibility beyond this.
Reddit really has been a shit show in the last few years, this is even more indication to jump ship and go somewhere else.
https://voat.co/ perhaps?
I've used Voat since it was a libertarian site.
ECR doesn't belong on Voat.
The two main issues are: 

1 - I don't want to tell old people, IRL, to go to Voat.co and search for electronic cigarette.
They'll look at the front page and never get to ECR and just keep smoking.
2 - The users of Voat actively hate vapers for no real reason.
They hate a lot of things.
(Some people say Passa and Syco are jerks.
They're both extremely nice gentlemen by Voat standards.)
OMG i went to voat once.
I tried it, I did.
SO much racism and weird shit.
I made a few posts calling out the fact that every other post was about "n******s" and made my exit.
I mean a lot can be said the same about Reddit really.. at least they have free speach, though it's racist, but free non the less!
compared to the new Censor-Reddit.
Don't get me wrong, I fucking love Voat..
I just don't think the members of ECR would be happy there.
[removed]
Interesting, never had seen that before.
Is it supposed to be a reddit alternative?
Does it have all the sub topic forums like reddit?
Well the front page is a bit out there haha.
Seems like the right wing version of reddit.
Free speech means some can and will be offended though.
I just looked at voat for the first time a few minutes ago, cause it was linked in a thread about the /r/milliondollarextreme ban drama, and holy shit.
You know the scene in the Lion King where Mufasa tells Simba about the place they don't go?
That's Voat.
Voat is a vile cesspool.
The loyal trumpies that ruined pepe, went to voat to piss in the libertarian's koolaid and plan "alt-right" (racist/nazi) rallies when they started getting their subbs ahutdown here.
Edit:fix an autocorrect.
If there’s anything we all know, it’s the alt-right hates Liberians specifically.
Worse than 4chan?
Lmao, good analogy.
Its a toss-up.
I haven't been there in a long time, but 4 Chan had some redeeming qualities when I used it.
I'm struggling to find the same in Voat.
Its literally the place to go if you're too toxic for Reddit.
That should tell you something right there.
\^\^\^

Fixd thanks.
Quite a bit worse in my estimate.
