Original Response: 
If you're gonna join a raid with no KP and you know the fight, just please at least have **proper gear** and know a decent **rotation** for your character.
It feels bad having to kick people that say "I know the fight" but then do *3k dps* or in the case of a toughness-bound boss, the boss starts to aggro them because they're using armor/trinkets with toughness on them.
I love when MightyTeapot gets into raids with a no KP power reaper, but then does better dps than almost everyone, learn from that, learn a good rotation, get the proper gear and do good dps before you get into a raid.
In the case of a healer, learn how to heal and how to play your class before you get into raids with no KP.
Snow Crows' website has a lot of good, up to date information on raid builds and rotations.
Metabattle also has good raid builds.
I have a friend who was a total noob at raids but he knows his scourge **very very very** well.
I invited him into an exp run of W1-&gt;W2, he only knew VG and Gorseval and he had better dps than *everyone* in almost every boss, with only very concise and short explanations from me through whisper.
Just a tip so people don't kick you if you're not exp (:

**TL;DR:** if you are going to get into an exp raid asking for KP with no KP, at least know your class and watch a video of the raid boss.

Random gw2 player : Anet said I could play w/e I want, so I play shitty build and you MUST play with me because... because !
!!!
(because I don't want to create a team with noobs like me and I want you to carry me)
Because without catering to me, the casual majority of the player base who are surely your major paying customer, the game would be doomed and those elitist circle jerks would have nothing to play.
Therefore the dev should enforce random grouping, disallow DPS meters and better yet, make raid easy mode with equivalent access to legendary armors.
Look at Wild Star!!!
(no I'm totally not serious although I may have spoken for someone else).
Reminds me of [this](https://i.redd.it/h15nxnaeock11.jpg) picture from the World of Warcraft Reddit the other day.
And for those who don't know ilvl is item level.
It's the average level of all your gear.
Taken to an extreme this is a rediculious pov but it is not without merit.
Lmao that’s amazing.
Having appropriate I’ll for the content you’re doing is crucial in wow.
Getting worked up or offended over such a basic question is bonkers.
Either that's fake or that guy's really desperate for a healer, the attitude in the first response alone would be enough for me to reject someone from a raid group.
If that were me being nice to someone the convo wouldn't even have been half as long lol.
Geez.
And GW2 has even less of a barrier for entry, you can just dump 20 gold on the TP to get a set of exotic berserker's or magi's, watch some videos and you're ready for training raids.
It takes maybe an hour to go from casual open world player to raider.
Surely it's not a big ask.
If you ever take a look at the official that is the common stance of all the raid protest topics.
It's the internet.
It's almost always fake.
Don't worry, I'd never go to the offical forums for a game.
thread link?

Ok, so I checked your comment history and did not see a thread link.
Can you just link me to it?
You could've when you replied.
xD.

That's the image; I wanted the actual thread link.
The thread where that picture was originally posted.
Duh.
So, got a link to the original thread where that image was posted /u/-GrayMan-?

Cheers.
Lets be honest.
You make a pug group to do raids.
You need a chrono - OH FUCK.
10 minutes later someone pm's you they can chrono but they're not very experienced.
You ask their LI not really caring about howmuch it is.
Then shit like this happens.
I can see it.
I mean i've seen groups of 250 li accept a 30 li chrono because no other reason than none of them wanted to do chrono.
I've seen people get upset for so much as mentioning their build or DPS... while running staff necro with 4 signets in PvE.
I don't know if its fake or not.
But I don't doubt shit like this actually happens.
It is without merit; by casual players continously bullying out the "elitest circle jerks" they themselves will eventually be left with nothing to play.
GW2 has lost plenty of hardcore paying customers and will continue to do exactly that.
Healthy, nice community would have diverse aspects which can interact with eachother.
GW2 has not managed to maintain that for most of its aspects and has been constantly reducing the "core of content" it supports throughout the lifetime.
I don't think that is what is happening in Guild Wars, but even if it was, why couldn't a game be for casual players?
Are you suggesting that people who play for a challenge spend more money on the game?
I'm suggesting that a healthy game especially an mmo benefits from having both hardcore and more casual aspects.
It's usually your hardcore players maintaining guilds, communities, third party websites, tools, communications, streams, vods, external content, guids, ...

And those are mostly gone.
But it still hurts casual players.
It's mostly the hardcore players who do things like raid trainings, WvW guilds, WvW commanders, ... And many of those are gone.
And as they go, more hardcore players that sticked for these communities and guilds go with them.
The more go, the fewer remain capable of playing the way they enjoyed and the more they go forth.
Overall it doesn't suddenly bring a lot more extra casual players.
It doesn't suddenly bring more attention to the game either.
Instead the game dies outside of a few dedicated places.
GW2 is a huge game yet, nothing on twitch, virtually nothing on youtube, no advertisement yet you tell me it caters to casual players that it struggles to reach.
You don't suddenly get "more money for more content".
You get less money for less content which only makes more of your diversity die down; which long term still means less money.
And meanwhile, your product gets worse.
Casual players aren't suddenly going to lead a WvW group properly.
They aren't suddenly going to make high end raid groups and teach players how to do them; much less en-masse.
And surely you agree that even casual players who don't directly care about meta and balance benefit from having a balance metagame in either pvp, wvw or pve.
I'm suggesting that by catering towards casuals, many aspects casuals enjoyed become less enjoyable for them.
You're a perfect example.
You look at easy to understand surface connections like "are you suggesting hardcore players pay more?!"
but that's not really the point; is it?
The point is how does anet maximize their profits - which combines things like good long term game health and short term money / interest.
Do you think it's a good idea to make the game full pay to win?
I can guarantee it'll give them more cash short term.
But long term I think we both agree it'd severaly harm their business.
I have nothing against GW2 being catered towards casuals in a sensible way.
But this blanket "lets try make everything super casual friendly" has completely backfired everywhere except in open world PvE...
Which shouldn't suprise anyone.
And I think anet has lost out overall despite the content they invested in by doing so.
They lost significant amounts of paying players and will continue to do so long term.
"But that is normal!!!
all mmo's lose players!!!"
is it really?
If you compare us to 3rd rate asian grinders maybe... but frankly I think GW2 was better than that.
Hmm.. well, thinking about it, you're absolutely right that hardcore players are key to an MMO because they generate so much content for less hardcore players (organizing things, teaching) and that if you don't pay enough attention to them you're going to get a game that stagnates and dies.

Summary: 
I don't know if its fake or not.
You don't suddenly get "more money for more content".
But it still hurts casual players.
You make a pug group to do raids.
And as they go, more hardcore players that sticked for these communities and guilds go with them.
