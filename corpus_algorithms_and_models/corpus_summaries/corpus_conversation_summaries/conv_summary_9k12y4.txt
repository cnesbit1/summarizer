Years prior to the public accusations Blasey Ford discusses the assault in therapy.
That's corroborated by her husband and therapist.
Learn why women don’t report.
Especially thirty years ago.
Hint: it’s shitty reactions like yours.

Locked up is a pretty far cry from not getting a lifetime appointment to the SC.

That's so nice.
But the corroboration needed to convict or even try someone in court has to be unbiased.
Who else is saying he was there?
He was the one?
What her therapist or husband can say is that she told them .
Nice.
She just told the whole world.
Doesn't stand up.
I'm not buying it.
This is not a court.
The standard is totally different.
Rather than guilty beyond a reasonable doubt we should be looking for the highest standard of character for a life-long judicial apointee.

It's not a court in the legal sense but it is in the broader sense that you are passing public judgement on someone and punishing them.
It would have been far preferable if the initial allegation was handled internally when it was made pre nomination (I think)  instead of being forced into the public sphere at the 11th hour.

Summary: 
This is not a court.
That's corroborated by her husband and therapist.
What her therapist or husband can say is that she told them .
