Brie Larson is finally getting her due in the sub.
I'm loving it!

It's kinda weird to me that she just won an Oscar &amp; I have no idea who she is and what she's been in.
If you haven't seen it, check "Short term 12" that's the best thing she has been in.
Check out United States of Tara.
It's kind of a weird, mediocre show, but Larson is amazing in it.
Watch Scott Pilgrim vs The World.
She's hilarious in that and 21 Jump Street.
Well, 'Room' is, by far.
But 'Short Term 12' is a great movie, and she's great in it...
I feel the same way.
That owl movie anybody?
Beatrice the bear?
Mary Jane?

Summary: 
I feel the same way.
