Original Response: 
&gt;Roman Quaedvlieg notes Peter Dutton’s remarks “with bemusement”.
He is adamant the conversation occurred.
“I completely reject his assertion I have fabricated evidence.
I urge Dutton to desist from personal attacks ...
I anticipated he may have reacted in this manner.”.
&gt;“I anticipated he may have reacted in this manner.”

Sounds like he has the receipts.
&gt; “I anticipated he may have reacted in this manner.”

so does that mean Quaedvlieg is telling the truth?
else how could he anticipate it?
Dutton has form when it comes to playing the man, rather than the ball.
Juding by what was said in the after lunch  session,it seems he kept a journal with copy of contact logs

Dutton should be worried.
Fuck man monday needs to hurry up.
Like a child on internet voice comms.
"But, but, your mum gay".
Potato has a mental age of 12.
I feel a defamation lawsuit coming.
You don't get as high up in Defence as he has without learning to get everything in writing.
He isn't an idiot and Dutton has gone full Trump on him, this should get interesting.
He means that he's familiar enough with Dutton to know he would throw a petulant little tantrum like a spoilt child and start tossing around irrational ad hominem insults instead of addressing the accusations against him.
Dutton: "I did Quaedvlieg's mum"
Oh Lordy I hope there are tapes.
Lol, you sound more like a child on internet voice comms than Dutton.
Mind you, that's not hard, Dutton reacts like this all the time.
I mean every scandal he has been involved with involves him lying, being presented with evidence he is lying, attacking the source of the evidence, refusing to apologise and back down, then attacking Labor/the public/journalists.

Summary: 
Dutton: "I did Quaedvlieg's mum"
I anticipated he may have reacted in this manner.”.
Like a child on internet voice comms.
