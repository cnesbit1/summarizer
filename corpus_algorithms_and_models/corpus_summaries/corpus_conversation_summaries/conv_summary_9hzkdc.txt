What is up with these 2nd person posts.

Really?
You don't think that anyone gets rescued from bad situations by strangers?
Sure, any given story could be fake, but I don't see what makes this so hard to believe.
Why would the writing style alone make a story fake?
People write in different ways.
Shut the format of writing as a letter to someone is a pretty darn common one, so easy to see what aspires the format.

If you look at my post history you'll see me talk about being assaulted before.
You'll also see me talk about my relationship occasionally.
No matter what they just want to tell their story.
It's not to thank anyone.
Your story isn’t far fetched.
Women give other women rides all the time - myself included.
Hell I gave an older gentleman a ride who couldn’t figure out how to use the uber app.
And questioning your assault history?
Statistically speaking, you’re more likely to have been assaulted *than not*.
Sad times.
Glad you’re safe OP, &amp; when you begin to feel a sense of safety again, pay it forward!
People want to share their story often because they hope these stories will help us create aa better world for women, for men, and for all living things.
I don't know what it is about San Fran.
It's definitely not the safest place in the world.
I've been down there for work many times, and I do not dare get drunk and walk in public there.
Anything *could* be fake on reddit, on most of the internet really.
Why do you think this is automatically fake though?
