 I got pretty mad at our Lord Jesus.
I know using porn is a sin, but ......

Porn is cheap substitute for a real thing (relationship) and if I can't get the real  thing my way I reach for a substitute.
I'm a passionate computer  programmer who's not willing to waste time by going out and try to get  women to like me.
My attitude:  I'm right here, I'm smart and good  looking and I want to be your partner and be there always for you but  I'm not willing to my waste time by having to search for the right  woman.
And since dating isn't working that way I use porn as a  substitute.
Period.

I don't expect you to understand.
I'm just tired of waiting for the right lady I could give my affection to.
One thing to consider is that the women in those porn videos might not be there voluntarily.
They could be supporting drug habits, the victims of an abusive boyfriend, sex trafficking victims, etc.
.
I found the right lady.
It's worth the time, effort, and the wait!
!
Thank you for not judging me harshly.
I've been single for 6 years now.
I do admit my attitude is here to blame I just really dislike wasting my time.
I'm working on my own project and it takes priority in my life.
But it doesn't mean I don't want woman in my life.
I genuinely do and I want to give her my all.
No holding back.
I want make her feel safe, make her feel she can trust me, have confidence in me and all that.
I just hate the idea of going out there and hoping for bumping into the right woman.
If God is almighty He knows what to do.
He can just point a finger and it's done.
I used to be a computer programmer and I was just like you!
I had a number of projects I was working on and I would sometimes go all day and all night.
It can be addicting!
And don't you think maybe a little unhealthy?
Maybe a woman could help you round out your life?
Not trying to push you or anything... just a suggestion!
This is a misconception, literally all porn is from consenting people.
There’s only the deep web stuff that is dodgey.
I absolutely agree !
Woman may improve my life.
In several areas, perhaps.
I've been asking God to get her banging on my front door shouting "I'm the lady you've been waiting for !
".
So I don't have to waste my time going into public events and things other people indulge in just to meet her.
Sounds silly little bit but it is not a complete non-sense to a dedicated man.

source?
Good luck!
Where’s your source that most porn is rape?
This just seems like a Christian lie to put porn a bad light to deter ppl from watching it 

(And because I’ve never heard this before)
&gt; Where’s your source that most porn is rape?
I never said that.
I said that **some** of it **may** not be consensual.
&gt; This just seems like a Christian lie to put porn a bad light to deter ppl from watching it

I'm an Atheist.
And I suppose I would agree that there is nothing wrong with truly consensual porn.
As for the consensual part, I don't have any source.
It's just something I gleaned from the people I have known and the places I have been.
But I think if you make a statement like "literally all porn is from consenting people" you should have a source to back up your claim.
I think it’s kinda unreasonable to make these claims but I guess person experiences would have a big impact on opinions.
Tbh there isn’t rlly a way to know, a majority f porn is probably clean but it’s the small part which is which is a hidden problem.
&gt; I think it’s kinda unreasonable to make these claims 

Ever read up on sex trafficking?
Sex trafficking isn’t that big a part of the porn industry, just illegal prostitution right?
Did you read about the woman who was charged with trafficking herself?
Real human trafficking is a none issue in western culture, but we've passed laws that redefine it to actually make a problem where one doesn't exist.
I really don't know.
I mean porn isn't just created in the United States and sold in the United States.
It would seem that porn coming from overseas from places that have lax laws about such things would be very suspect.

Summary: 
I found the right lady.
I said that **some** of it **may** not be consensual.
I genuinely do and I want to give her my all.
