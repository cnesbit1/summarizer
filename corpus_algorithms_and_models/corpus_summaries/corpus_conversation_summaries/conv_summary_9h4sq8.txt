Original Response: 
Maybe the bike was not stolen it simply wondered off and got lost and this kind human being took it in so it wasnt hit by a car.
God stop assuming the worst of people.
Guys stop downvoting, I'm pretty sure he was making a joke here.

I want to meet the person who thinks a motorcycle can get lost on its own.
They're either really high or genuinely retarded (in the medical sense).

You joke but when my wife momentarily left her phone at the Target checkout and the guy behind her stole it I tracked it to the house- and the police *asked* if it was there.
Her leaving it for a moment on the counter meant (per the police) that they had no probable cause to enter the house as it was not stolen, just in their possession.
Target had him on camera grabbing it and walking out - but my wife (again, per the police) was not in possession of her property when it was taken.
Sigh.
So you have to be holding everything you own in order to actually possess it?
Fuck I'm never letting go of my motorcycle, house or Bankaccount again..
