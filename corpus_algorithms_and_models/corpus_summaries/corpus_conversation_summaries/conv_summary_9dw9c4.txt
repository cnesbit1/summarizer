**Shit, my title should by "the objective morality argument for God is not necessary".

The main reason there exists a moral argument for god, the reason anyone bothers with this argument, is to satisfy the question "What makes you any more morally right than someone who believes the opposite is morally right?"
But in reality, a group who agrees that something is morally right can and does simply fight, whether physically, emotionally, politically etc for their morality to be imposed on those they have influence over.
Now, a theist who uses this argument may claim that this is a "might makes right" situation.
But the power the imposing group has over others doesn't make their moral imposition "right", it just makes it the one that is held more commonly.
This is whether or not a certain moral claim is "right".
This is currently how the world works, I don't see any possible situation where this is different, and I don't see a problem with a world like this.
So theists shouldn't have a problem with secular people acting this way since the outcome would be the same regardless.
So is this argument even necessary?
What do you think?
