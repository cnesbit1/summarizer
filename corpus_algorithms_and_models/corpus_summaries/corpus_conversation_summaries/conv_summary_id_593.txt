Original Response: 
I know today’s the last day to register.
Last week I mailed in a form I got online to register to vote, but I heard on the radio that Texas isn’t recognizing that as registration and that additional information is needed.
So, where can I go to register today?
Thank you!
As long as you physically signed the form you filled out online and mailed it to the Nueces County registrar's office, then you should be golden.
If you didn't physically sign it with ink, then you need to make a trip to the county registrar's office in Corpus and register in person.
Their office is in the courthouse downtown on Leopard Street.The news story they're talking about is [this one](https://www.chron.com/news/politics/texas/article/Texas-rejects-2-400-online-voter-registrations-as-13279521.php).
The group was superimposing voters' signatures digitally, which the Secretary of State's office doesn't like because it was basically a crude workaround to allow voters to vote online.
