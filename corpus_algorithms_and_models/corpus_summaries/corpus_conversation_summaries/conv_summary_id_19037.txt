Original Response: 
Underrated hottie.
Amazing.
Love this photoshoot.
Best she's ever done imo.
Wow, I must have missed this when the rest of the shoot was posted.
The best was definitely saved for last.

Completely useless sub with a terrible name.

My favorite pic of her!
So hot!
Meh she's alright.
Maybe I'm a bit biased because I cannot stand her acting.
Now bring on the downvotes.
was she in Scott pilgrim vs the world?
I like her.
I love HER, never mind the Photoshoot.
I think she's a good actress.
I don't think she would have been anywhere near as successful as she's been if she wasn't a good performer.

Summary: 
I think she's a good actress.
Best she's ever done imo.
