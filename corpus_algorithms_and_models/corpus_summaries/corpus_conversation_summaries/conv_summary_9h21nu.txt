both capitalism and socialism converge on a centralized economy.
People in this subreddit need to be aware that BTC was *never* created to solve the wealth inequality problem and it doesn't claim to solve that problem.
Anybody who tells you so is flat out wrong.
True.
Just visited Istanbul, Turkey.
As you know, the Lira is worth much less than say 2 months ago.
Some people who can afford to save money, can put that in bitcoin.
Others simply can't.
They will be left with nothing if their money keeps devaluating.
Only growing the gap.
Bitcoin might save the rich, but the poor will remain poor.
Unless you find a way to receive more bitcoin than you spend.
I know there are a lot of wealth redistribution advocates out there as well and if anything, BTC is anti-redistribution as it makes it infinitely harder to accomplish.
Goddammit none of you can extrapolate what I want by this data.
What it means is that none of you in here have any money.
None of you.
Except between 1% and 0.1% (maybe slightly more due to this demographic but still)

This means we need to pay more attention to the rich because they have monopolized all wealth now and in future.
This is not an opinion, it is a fact and we must be looking to them for liquidity and strong hands.
The value of Bitcoin dropped a lot more since the beginning of the year than the value of lira.
Saying that bitcoin can save anyone is exactly the same as saying that buying Euros will save someone.
In fact, buying Euros is probably better.
Welp.
Zoom out a little bit, economies and currencies don't fall or break in one year.
You're probably right that buying euro's is better, at this point.
But if you look at adoption rates of bitcoin in  Turkey, you see that many or discovering it now.
That must be the ones who can afford to save and speculate.
They will likely win the most if and when bitcoin survives.
I guess what I'm trying to say is that people tend to treat Bitcoin as some miracle cure, something that will save every economy in every country.
Which is far from the truth.
Likewise with Turkey, well, maybe some people will "win" by investing in bitcoin, maybe other people will "win" by investing in something completely different.
But the potential of bitcoin to have a groundbreaking impact on economies has always been exaggerated.
It doesn't address any of the problems that countries are facing, it does not address any of the problems that caused the recent 2007-2008 crash.
Many do see it as the cure unfortunately.
Bitcoins potential is much more than countering hyperinflation.
Hyperinflation is caused by much more than a trade war as well.
It was really sad to see hard working, modern Turks, suddenly not be able to travel to Europe anymore.
It's a closer-to-bed-show than Venezuela for example (for a European at least).

Summary: 
Bitcoins potential is much more than countering hyperinflation.
Some people who can afford to save money, can put that in bitcoin.
They will likely win the most if and when bitcoin survives.
What it means is that none of you in here have any money.
Many do see it as the cure unfortunately.
