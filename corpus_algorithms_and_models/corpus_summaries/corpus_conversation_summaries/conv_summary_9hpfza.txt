Original Response: 
I can take it and to some extent, I deserve it.
I accept it all.
I just want to know.
Also, if you know of anyone else who did it.
Would rather not disclose why I am going back to poly at such an advanced age although it isn't necessarily for a bad reason.
I feel it is the right thing to do and the right course for me in terms of what I want to do for a living.
would rather be behind on a path that is right than be ahead on a path that is wrong.
I will also obviously be working as I study (part time if i have to).
Sounds remarkably like what I'm going to end up.
I'm 25 now and more than likely will be expelled from uni pretty soon.
My previous qualification was A's, so probably will have to go the poly route at 26 as well.
Surprising how uncanny this is similar to my situation.
And I'm scared af.
Quickly lock down your units and transcript and get a transfer.
Don't worry, you can redeem yourself in Poly.
That's what I plan to do.
Hi if you don't mind sharing why you are expelled from uni?
Local uni ah?
Yeah.

Consistent but horrible result due to reasons.
u could go private uni.
That stinks....Like I was thinking if I get expelled from poly I might have to go ITE not go another poly.
$$$ is the problem lol.
bank loan leh?
or ur uni also on scholarship that's why....?
or like u got government grant and financial aid but used up liao?
More of still having to pay my school fees despite being expelled, which is like nearly 30k now.
wow it stinks man....omg I feel so sorry for you.

Summary: 
I just want to know.
That's what I plan to do.
u could go private uni.
I can take it and to some extent, I deserve it.
