Original Response: 
Living in SF, I run into a lot of characters.
Tonight, a kid (20), came up to me and called me beautiful.
I thanked him  and went back to my phone thinking he was just complimenting me.
No, he went on, drunkenly, to insult cooking and chefs in the industry (i cook for a living), all while boasting how expensive his clothes were and how beautiful I was.
Now, I'm okay to engage a few crazy or drunk people, but when he didn't stop talking for 20 minutes, I got nervous.
A woman about my age came on the train, and noticed my predicament.
I was able to lock eyes and she mouthed 'are you okay'.
Shaking my head, she called out to me, getting me out of the situation for a second, acting like she was my friend who happened to be on the train.
He still engaged me but was less upfront and in my space.
When he finally got off, I felt such relief and gratitude (he started having a tantrum by the end of the ride).
Kathleen, thank you.
You made me feel safer for 20 minutes when no one else did anything.
Thank you.
Dad of a young lady.
Too bad young women are approached like that.
That we still need "safety in numbers".
Call out other men when you see them do this.
Calling them out might get me a fellow man hit in the face.
Id prefer to go the fake friend route but I wouldnt want to make the girl uncomfortable or end up being another creepy stranger dude.
Edit: New plan of action is start a friendly convo with the creep in question, no escalation, no hostility, and hopefully the gal knows Ive got her back.
That's why this will keep happening.
The fact that you fear violence for telling another man to stop harassing a woman is a real problem.
How do men solve that?
I dont fear violence, I just dont want to escalate situations.
Especially with a drunk 20 yr old thats a loose canon and both our lives could be down the drain in 5 min.
How would I passively insert myself here is my question I suppose.

If you do nothing you endorse the status quo, which is women being harassed by a stranger.
You can do that if you want, but own it.
You're endorsing the status quo and keeping yourself safe at the expense of women who are harassed while you let it happen.

Yes - you have to take risks.
No you don’t have to seriously endanger your life - but you need to jump into the pool to rescue the kid, pull the person out of the burning car, help the person being harassed- hopefully in a way that minimises risk.
Not true... the last time I helped a woman (my aunt) in a similar situation (her fiance).
He pushed her during an arguement I hit him in the face and he pulled a gun on me.
Dude was too drunk to realize what he was doing was his excuse but that's just b.s.
Anyway, point being I learned a lesson about taking less violent problem solving methods because well I'm not really ready to die young.

Talk to him - divert the conversation perhaps, sometimes all it takes is them knowing that someone else is paying attention.
Another option might be to just engage the harasser in conversation and get his attention away from the harassee.
It’s intimidating to confront someone you’re stuck in a tiny space with for who knows how long, because like you said, it can escalate so quickly and this person is unpredictable.
The same reasons the harassee doesn’t confront right in that moment.
Distracting him might not teach him a lesson, but it might diffuse the situation.
You want a white knight.
Gottcha....
Ill give it a shot next time Im worried a girl is uncomfortable.
[deleted]
It totally would.
I would welcome any intervention and trust my gut about the person trying to help.
[deleted]
Never trust a person that considers someone who tries to stand up for others a "white knight".
It's literally called taking one for the team.
In this case, the dude was talking about his expensive clothes, so butt into the conversation and ask him where he got x item.
"Dude!
I need to know where you got that shirt!"
Just keep his attention, ask him what bars he'd been to, keep him talking and if you can, get him turned away from his original target.
Don't tune out guys harassing other people on the bus, especially if they look uncomfortable.
You don't have to escalate to make the situation more bearable for other people on the bus or train.
The fear of violence stops a lot of women as well - I’ve seen videos of women being bystanders, telling men to do something, and then continuing to be bystanders when the men refuse.
None of this is fair or equitable.
It’s sending the message that men are supposed to engage in violence, which is ridiculous because nobody is supposed to engage in violence.
Stop being so judgmental.
It isn’t some stranger responsibility to save you.
If you’ve taken any sociology classes you know that this isn’t because people who don’t step in are terrible scared people, people literally avoid helping or don’t know what to do Bc they think others will step in.
Haven’t you heard that if you’re in danger to tell “fire” instead of “help” or “rape”.
Not everyone is a super hero and it’s pretty embarrassing that you think a guy needs to save you and if he doesn’t he’s helping the problem.
Isn’t this what the whole women’s movement is all about?
That we are just as strong, as equal and willing as men, then yet you guys sit here and say a guy needs to save you because you’re too small to save yourself?
Maybe you do need men in your life then?
Maybe they are stronger than us huh?

I was in a line of people to pay for gas, and one guy was absolutely railing on a young girl cashier about some mistake / error.
He's entitled to be a bit of an upset customer if things were wrong, but he was WAY OTT and clearly she was upset and intimidated.
Nobody was saying anything as his tirade grew and began to include swearing and getting louder.
I suddenly had a thought: what if that was my 20 year old daughter?
I walked to the front of the line and told him to shut up or I would move him outside till a supervisor or someone else came, but he was not permitted  to abuse her like that just because of whatever.
The girl started crying and he shrank away.
People think they are entitled to destroy your personal peace just because something was up with their order / whatever.

If you’re worried about your safety by saying something, imagine how we feel.
Last time I verbally expressed discomfort the dude escalated from touching my shoulder and side to try to intimidate me into giving up my front row spot at a show to straight up rubbing his dick on me.
When I finally could catch the attention of a security guard, they shrugged and told me I could leave.
The the dudes friend violently assaulted my husband who had done his damn best to protect me.
If say, the very large dude standing next to my harasser had said something or done anything it may have made a difference.
I was in a very similar situation more recently although I will say the guy bothering me in this case was more run of the mill drunk than straight up predator.
Another guy in the crowd asked him politely to stop shoving people and then he got the attention of a security guard who knew how to do his damn job and asked him to keep an eye on things and he did.
The guy calmed down, everything was fine.
Later drunk guy decided I was cool because I had tattoos and was with my husband so he didn’t want to bother me???
But he decided to bother a lesbian couple behind me.
I was able to just slightly move myself closer to them and block him out.

What, talk to people?
OP never said he came in to her or actually did anything inappropriate other than drunkenly ramble at her and annoy her, not in an insidious way, just an utterly clueless wary.
Kathy did a great job shielding OP without escalating or insinuating anything.
[removed]
Nobody said only men.
[removed]
Where's that list that's always posted whenever someone says something like this?
It's like 99 bullet points, complete with news articles, about women who got murdered for less.
[removed]
Where and when did they say only men should?
All persons, whatever gender, should look out for each other.
Sometimes it's not about teaching them a lesson, but just getting through the day.
It's not your job to fix everyone.
[removed]
And bring up stories like this to other men.
Morality tales help.
"Wow, I just read a story about a guy that cornered a woman on a train and did blah blah blah.
What a JERK!!!"
It lets your friends know that it isn't okay.
That's one of the biggest things we can do as guys.
Then it's a non-escalated situation, talking about a 3rd party.
If you see another guy doing this to someone, distract them.
Ask them about their shoes, or clothes, or phone or something.
Start a conversation with them.
It gives the woman an opportunity to leave while he is engaged elsewhere.
If she doesn't actually want to leave, then cool, she'll let you know.

Sadly even men can be in pressing or dangerous situations if they are alone.
The threat is not just on women.
It is scary being a woman by yourself and being approached by a group of men drunk or not, it's happened to me quite a few times but it doesn't deter me from continuing to live my life afraid every time I leave my house by myself.
If you see anyone, man or woman in an uncomfortable situation, you should do what you can to help, even something as simple as what this lady did for OP.

I’ve called men out for their behavior before, especially if there are others around.
Not only do I feel like it gives me somewhat a feeling of safely, but also it tends to embarrass the guy doing the harassing.
These people need to be called out and shamed for their behavior.

100% violence doesn't solve anything, and your question is a valid one.
I've attempted to insert myself as a guy friend in similar situations (where I did actually know the girl even) and generally the dude always feels threatened and gets aggressive.
I'd say trying to engage the dude by complimenting his shirt or something would be the best way to distract him then work from there.
Thank you!

I get it, you don't want "violence" (I guessing you probably have never been in a fight?...and that's okay) yes, a weapon could be used.
However, it's been my experience that fuckers like this; don't have a weapon.
If they did almost always they will flash it.
For a intimidation factor and response.
That being said
Get inbetween the two before you say whatever you want to say.
1st know your surroundings obstacle older people kids exist extra.
2nd focus on the fuckers throat if he has a beard and or facial hair.
Know that you will strike 1st in the throat or grab his facial hair.
Where the head goes the body follows.
Now place your dominant foot behind you and hands up shoulder height.
Say what you need to no more.
See what the reaction is.
If he advances you react if he talks you say nothing.
Each scenario is different and all have different challenges.
Believe it or not once people see you defending someone being picked on.
Others will rally behind you, it just takes that 1st move.
