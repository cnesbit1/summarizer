Costa Sur Wok &amp; Ceviche Bar15113 S Padre Island Dr #101, Corpus Christi, TX 78418(361) 945-8303.
Second this.
Third.
Also, not quite ceviche... but Yoshi Sushi has a roll called the "Luis' Ceviche Roll" and it's very very good.
Thanks... about to head over and chow down.
Its great but forewarning, the service isn't all that.
&amp;they are slow.
I go expecting it to take a while since its fresh.
I usually just have a drink &amp; chill.
But sometimes the servers can be inattentive.
I just can't quit their Ceviche Fusion.
yep.. had one guy working both the kitchen and the bar/restaurant.
We thought the food was pretty good but a little expensive, 2 beers, 2 mains and an appetizer @ 100 with tip.
Ha!
Not shocked at all.
&amp;Agreed, it can get pricey.
We just go on occasion to treat ourselves.
Glad you liked the food!
