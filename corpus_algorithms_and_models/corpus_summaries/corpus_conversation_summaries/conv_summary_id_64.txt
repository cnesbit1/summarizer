Original Response: 
I wanted to go up to Austin this weekend, but don't have the funds.
Are there any little towns about an hour or two away, that would be worth visiting?
San Antonio is nice and it's 2 hr away.
Port Aransas is nice and that's like 45 minutes away.
Not really, Port Aransas is small and touristy.
San Antonio is bigger with things to do.
Everything else is just little and not really worth the drive.
My advice would be to spend the money on a fishing pole and license and have a good time at the beach, if the weather ever improves.
Rockport and Port Aransas!
Wonderful beach towns.
What do you like to do?
Goliad is nice if your a history buff.
I love going to Goliad.
This time of year should be especially nice.
Presidio La Bahia and the Mission Espiritu Santo have lovely grounds that are so pleasant to walk around.
Grab a sandwich and enjoy a picnic while getting some history.
Port Aransas is an awesome place.
Rockport/Fulton area is nice,and there are some really nice restaurants there.

Summary: 
Goliad is nice if your a history buff.
Port Aransas is an awesome place.
