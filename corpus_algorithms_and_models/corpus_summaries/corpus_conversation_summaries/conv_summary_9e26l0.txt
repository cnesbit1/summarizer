Original Response: 
Just a question for my school project.
Would really appreciate detailed answers.
Thanks!
would like to visit holocaust sites in Poland next time when I have the funds.
Think they will be really interesting and be a very unique experience.
Coincidentally, the exact question for my project is if  Auschwitz-I is a popular place amongst Singaporeans.
Oh nice, but I'm the only one I know that is into dark tourism.
I don't have any friends of family even slightly interested.
I think they are more creeped out by it.

I think they wouldn't mind visiting those more morbid landmarks if they are already in the country for other attractions but it's very unlikely that anyone I know will center a whole trip around it.
Alright, really appreciate your insight on this!
Thanks!
Have been to Auschwitz twice both on school trips with overseas university.
Intriguing aspects and correlation to Japanese occupation of Singapore and their internment in camps in the US.
I was fascinated by World War history more than dark tourism, it added perspective to my relatively sheltered Singaporean life.
I suppose the comfortable life in Singapore is a factor for people visiting locations such as Auschwitz.
Thanks for your insight!
Am Singaporean, have been there, have quite a number of friends who've been there.
Does this count?
Hahah.
I love visiting cemeteries and mausoleums.
Went to the [Zentralfriedhof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Central_Cemetery) and the [Père Lachaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A8re_Lachaise_Cemetery) last year.
Tons of famous people - artists, composers, revolutionaries, philosophers, etc buried there.
**Vienna Central Cemetery**

The Vienna Central Cemetery (German: Wiener Zentralfriedhof) is one of the largest cemeteries in the world by number of interred, and is the most famous cemetery among Vienna's nearly 50 cemeteries.

**Père Lachaise Cemetery**

Père Lachaise Cemetery (French: Cimetière du Père-Lachaise, [simtjɛːʁ dy pɛːʁ laʃɛːz]; formerly, cimetière de l'Est, "Cemetery of the East") is the largest cemetery in the city of Paris (44 hectares or 110 acres), although there are larger cemeteries in the city's suburbs.
Père Lachaise is in the 20th arrondissement and is notable for being the first garden cemetery, as well as the first municipal cemetery.
It is also the site of three World War I memorials.
The cemetery is on Boulevard de Ménilmontant.

Surely!
Didn’t expect this much people to show interests or even experiences of visiting Auschwitz.
Why visit them?
Out of interest I suppose?
My friends and I are twenty-something university students.
Most of us went there while on exchange studies, traveling Europe.
I guess my demographic would be most likely to show interest in places of historic importance.
You could just head to Punggol beach for such experience by the way.
The massacre of the Chinese population by the Japanese is as or even more heinous compared to what the nazis have done.
It all boils down to the fact that US protected Japan post war and Germany actually openly apologising for the brutality commuted, resulting in the issue being widely spoken and recognised today.
I also enjoy visiting cemeteries (have visited the one in Paris) partly because of my anthropological background and interest.
Not sure if that is considered dark tourism though.
I've been to several Jewish and communist-history museums around central Europe, those I find to be 'darker' (more morbid and closer to the academic definition) than cemeteries of famous people.
We went.
Boyfriend and I definitely would want to go there one day since we’re both interested in history.
Ossuaries and museums with torture artifacts are on my list as well.
Used to google the ones used in Europe and Asia throughout history.
People might think it’s too morbid, but I feel it’s fascinating though haha!
Morbid curiosity I suppose.
There are certain mausoleums in spain and italy too that openly display dead people who are centuries old.
I will be visiting concentration camps next year or the year after.
some cemeteries are pretty damn amazing or amazingly damn pretty.
Schools bring students there quite often in the past IIRC.
Until MOE cut budget and no more subsidized trips to europe lol.
Have been to Auschwitz.
Really somber experience, reminded me alot of Schindler's list.
Unfortunately some tourists are dumb af.

Boh bian...your healthcare subsidies must come from somewhere =x.
