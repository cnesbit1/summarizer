Original Response: 
I’m in college and I recently (two weeks ago) learned about/have been studying the incel communities I can find for a paper I’m writing on modern misogyny.
Basically researching incels scares me and the way they hate women triggers me a lot as a two time rape victim.
I just want to know any coping mechanisms/mental attitudes of those who’ve dealt with incels and/or rape who can give some comforting words.
Love you all!
I also get trigger whenever I read about incels.
But I tend to imagine they’re just animals and cannot think straight.
If that helps?
Idk, my dog is much friendlier than them.
Try mental illness that makes them lose grip to reality.
Or they've also been traumatized.
From what I've read about them, rejected many times...
Rejection isn’t trauma.
And it most certainly doesn’t justify, violence, rape, sex slaves and whatnot I’ve read from them.
&gt;Rejection isn’t trauma.
I'd disagree.
Rejection, if combined with humiliation can be very traumatic.
Especially if it's public rejection.
Heck, even public speaking can be traumatic.
I haven't looked at incels closely, tbh, just try to think what can make someone so angry.
Do they really advocate sex slaves?
Trauma is usually related to severe abuse, experiencing people dying, killing, rape etc.
You won’t find someone who’ll get diagnosed with PTSD just cause girls won’t fuck him.
Don’t throw the word trauma around like it’s nothing.
And Public speaking?
Are you serious?
Yes being ugly (most of them aren’t, tbh) and therefore rejected feels awful.
But it doesn’t justify all that hate.
Not all of them are so horribly misogynistic and all that, of course.
But there even is a tiny minority of them who’ll go as far as killing people.
Take Elliot Rogers or that Canadian guy a few months ago.
They are celebrated as heroes and saints in the community.
This is NOT just being a little angry anymore.
Look at r/inceltears for some horrible highlights of incel posts.
There are shitposts made by IT users, yes, but most are real.
Incels try saying it’s only fun memes, but nope.
&gt; You won’t find someone who’ll get diagnosed with PTSD just cause girls won’t fuck him.
... And Public speaking?
Are you serious?
Stress from public humiliation after approaching someone romantically: 

1 Girl wants to ask a guy out but is afraid of rejection and humiliation:

2 Girl devastated after she invited a guy to prom and he turned her down.
Another rejection and "shitty self esteem now".

Rejection and depression do not justify misogyny and hate.
And here we go again.
That sounds like depression.
NOT trauma.
Depression, not trauma.
What’s there not to understand?
Ok. What caused the depression, then?
Rejection.
Which is fine to say.
It’s just ridiculous and insulting to call that a trauma.
Agreed, but that's a common reaction.
In women, too, not just men.
Look at 2018 New Years resolution of @msemilymccombs.
She's a Huffington post editor.
"Band together to kill all men".
https://web.archive.org/web/20171230024355/https://twitter.com/msemilymccombs

She admits she had been raped 

http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5ba3b77fe4b069d5f9d0c7ee/amp?ncid=engmodushpmg00000004&amp;ncid=engmodushpmg00000004&amp;__twitter_impression=true

but wants to kill ALL men, not just her assailant.
Let's look in the dictionary.
Merriam-Webster, m-w.com

Definition of Trauma 

1a: an injury (such as a wound) to living tissue caused by an extrinsic agent

--&gt; b: a disordered psychic or behavioral state resulting from severe mental or emotional stress or physical injury

--&gt;c: an emotional upset

Fits the definition.
Yes, those people I referenced weren't assaulted, but they suffered "severe mental or emotional stress".
How about rejection that occurred hundreds of times?
Injury doesn't have to be strong and acute.
It can be cumulative and repetitive.
Diagnostic Criteria [3]

A.
Exposure to a stressful event or situation (either short or long lasting) of exceptionally threatening or catastrophic nature, which is likely to cause pervasive distress in almost anyone.
B.
Persistent remembering or "reliving" the stressor by intrusive flash backs, vivid memories, recurring dreams, or by experiencing distress when exposed to circumstances resembling or associated with the stressor.
C.      Actual or preferred avoidance of circumstances resembling or associated with the stressor (not present before exposure to the stressor).
D.     Either (1) or (2):

(1)     Inability to recall, either partially or completely, some important aspects of the period of exposure to the stressor

(2)       Persistent symptoms of increased psychological sensitivity and arousal (not present before exposure to the stressor) shown by any two of the following:

a) difficulty in falling or staying asleep;

b) irritability or outbursts of anger;

c) difficulty in concentrating;

d) hyper-vigilance;

e) exaggerated startle response

 

 E.        Criteria B, C (For some purposes, onset delayed more than six months may be included but this should be clearly specified separately.)
This is the definition from ICD-10.
Official criteria for all diagnoses in Europe.
So?
Doesn’t make it ANY less insane and wrong.
Also a few posts and tweets don’t make this „common“.
Well, we're both right.
You are using PTSD criteria, I was using colloquial definition.
And even then... Look at this: 

&gt;B. experiencing distress when exposed to circumstances resembling or associated with the stressor.
&gt;C. Actual or preferred avoidance of circumstances resembling or associated with the stressor

&gt;Persistent symptoms of increased psychological sensitivity

&gt;a) difficulty in falling or staying asleep;

&gt;c) difficulty in concentrating;

Of course, social rejection isn't equal to being on the battlefield or surviving torture, I don't try to prove that.
But it's damaging, too.
I'm sure I can find some bibliography to that effect.
What I'm saying is "hurt creates hurt" and "we gotta be gentle with one another.
Life is hard as it is".
I agree, it is also insane and wrong.
This hate mongering from BOTH genders has to stop.
But McCombs is still working at Huffington Post and influencing others.
There were calls to fire her.
https://www.inc.com/suzanne-lucas/huffpost-editor-says-new-years-resolution-is-to-kill-all-men.html

But they were ignored by the leadership of Huffington Post.
Which means it's ok for her to do that?
1.
This is old.
Look at Sally Miller Gearhart
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Miller_Gearhart

"III) The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race."
This is calls for genocide.
And she was the celebrated founder of the first university gender studies program.
Other university programs with these ideas followed.
How is that normal?
2.
This is new.
Sarah Jeong.
Sexist racist sadistic tweets.
One of the tweets said: “oh man it’s kind of sick how much joy i get out of being cruel to old white men”.
Another read “are white people genetically predisposed to burn faster in the sun, thus logically being only fit to live underground like groveling goblins”.
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/03/sarah-jeong-new-york-times-twitter-posts-racism

But New York Times stood by her.
This racism, sexism, ageism, and sadism was dismissed as "a joke".
See a pattern?
I could dig up more examples.
What kind of reaction do you expect from condoned calls for male genocide?
From hate speech like this?
From admitted sadism towards the weak ("old men")?
Do you expect adoration and gratitude?
I'm very sad when typing this.
It looks like a propaganda build-up before a war.
I've seen this in Russia with 3 wars, two in Chechnya, one in Ukraine.
First, you sow hatred to the other side.
Then, they'll start to kill each other on their own.
That incel guy killing people in Toronto .
That girl pouring bleach on men's groins in Moscow subway.
Both sides must stop it.

Summary: 
Especially if it's public rejection.
And here we go again.
This is calls for genocide.
Rejection and depression do not justify misogyny and hate.
But it doesn’t justify all that hate.
Rejection, if combined with humiliation can be very traumatic.
