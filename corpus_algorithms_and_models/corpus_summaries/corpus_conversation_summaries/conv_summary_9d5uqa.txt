Original Response: 
23NOV2017 - Between 1230 and 1232 this morning, there were three long, loud sirens coming from the direction of NAS-CC.
Each lasted about 10 seconds, and they were not a common style of siren (i.e.
not an air raid horn, not a klaxon).
Did anyone else hear them?
Anyone who works on the base know what happened?
Robert Hull was making a turkey.
Didn't hear it from TAMU-CC, might have come from CCAD.
Nothing has happened on base.
Still just as boring as ever.
Stop it.
Robert Hull will never do three things 1.
Move from Corpus 2.
Leave moms house 3.
Stop it.

Summary: 
Nothing has happened on base.
Robert Hull was making a turkey.
