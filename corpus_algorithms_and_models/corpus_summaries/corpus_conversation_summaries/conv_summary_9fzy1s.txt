I’m so confused because none of the photos have any drastic differences.
You can look completely different than in photos than what you look like in person depending on angles and lighting alone.
And honestly nobody realistically expects someone to look *exactly* like their profile photo.
Go on the date.
You’re fine.
:)
Ok thanks so I look different in both tinder pics honestly?
in one photo you hair is forward, in one your hair is back.
Other than that, I genuinely can’t see the problem.
I look the same on the tinder pics compared to my 8 photo album pics?
Them tinder pics are from last Saturday but in person I’m 182vm tall and slim and lanky.
Yes!
No bullshit, you look similar.
Also angles &amp; lighting!!!
Go on the date.
:)
Similar?
Are you a girl?
If it’s ok to ask.
Yes, I’m a girl.
Yes, you look similar.
Again, nobody expects you to look exactly like your profile pick.
No one I’ve gone on dates with had.
I think you’re being too hard on yourself.
Ok thanks.
I look the same and no less uglier?
Not ugly at all so relax.
No.
You look pretty much the same in all of the pics.
And as a man in barber school, id recommend finding a style that you can rock the fuck out of.
But regardless of that you're fine.
It took me a long time to let myself not give a fuck about other people's judgments of me.
There are people out there that will think you're attractive and some of those you'll share that interest in them.
Think of it this way.
I don't like country music.
Its not for me.
But why would i waste my time on hating on it when i could spend that same allotment of time on shit i like/love?
Just because someone may or may not find you attractive doesn't mean you aren't to others.
Now go make that date happen, bro.
If she doesn't find you attractive, someone else will.
Don't mope about it.
Its not worth the energy.
Pretty much the same?
Ppl here are basically saying I look different:/
Im telling you you arent "surprising" her if thats you in the pics.
What im telling you is to relax, man.
Just go on the date and stop being hard on yourself.
I too struggle with confidence.
Have for a long time.
But i force myself to be confident and it works.
Find what works for you style-wise and that will go along ways.
Ok thanks.
I look the exact same honestly?
Yes.
I can see its the same person in them.
But not any where near as attractive as the tinder pics tho lol.
Im a skinny tall guy and i slouch alot.
Its natural at this point.
But i try to work on that.
When i catch myself slouching i fix my posture.
That alone helps my confidence.
Some of the prettiest women are with some fugly dudes.
You arent one of them.
You are going to be fine.
Remember, you dont have to be attractive to everyone.
Everyone has a different type.
I married my type.
Shes attractive to me.
And lucky for her im her type.
After that it really doesnt matter who thinks im attractive.
Like its a confidence boost but i dont need that anymore.
Being comfortable in the body you were given is an attractiveness booster on its own.
People gravitate towards others that interest them, in all relationships, romantic and non- romantic.
You are a human that deserves respect.
If you get disrespected, they can go fuck off.
But they also deserve the same respect.
Idk if you can or would, but weed helped me alot.
Gerting high and "meditating" on my confidence helped my psyche a lot.
You need to read what people say...
Ok thanks dude.
Brutal Honestly tho I look the sameness in the 2 tinder pics?
Just not 100% the same?
But some said I look different :/
Have you read what ive wrote?
What other people have written?
Because it seems like you arent comprehending what is being said to you.
**yes you look the same** 

Camera angle and lightning **CAN** effect how people look in photos.
Keyword is **CAN**
But the camera angle and lighting make me look different I worry.
... bruh... plz... 

Im not talking about *your* photos specifically.
Me and some of the others that have commented on this post are talking about photos on general.
Im trying to help you.
But i can see why people are frustrated with you.
Its seems like you dont even read what is written too you.
He never does and he always starts another thread asking the same question.

Summary: 
But some said I look different :/
I look the exact same honestly?
I can see its the same person in them.

I look the same and no less uglier?
You are going to be fine.
You arent one of them.
