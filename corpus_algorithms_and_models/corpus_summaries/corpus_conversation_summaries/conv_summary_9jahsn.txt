I can redeem the codes or ask some peiple to redeem it for you :)
What sort of RNG redeems you after?
Not sure how RNG stuff works but I'd like to have some 2018 events with competitive natures and IVs.
I could RNG the PAL Poipole code for you, or I could RNG a Wind Lugia?
I can't do NA codes unfortunately.
*I RNG using PCalc.
Can you redeem JPN codes?
I might need some help redeeming (especially for single nature requests)
Yeah I can redeem on JPN Moon.
I'm assuming you can also trade save files?
I do need (3) 1-nature redeems and (2) 3-nature redeems.
I'd prefer video proofs but photo proof is also okay.
After redeeming, I'd like to have the file sent to me.
I can trade whatever code/s you need.
Yeah I can do saves.
So you want 5 saves played to first PC with Lugia redeemed yeah?
I can do that for 3 codes.
Nope, it will only be one save as Lugia can be redeemed multiple times in one save.
Ah forgot that about JPN codes.
Well I guess just 1 Lugia code then?
I think that's great!
I will send the first two codes now :)
To finalize, it'll be:

1 JPN save played to the PC

* IGN: Miel

* 06/07/18 - Date of save creation

* (3) 1-nature redeems

* (2) 3-nature redeems: Bold | Lax | Impish | Timid (Date: today is okay)


For: 1 JPN Lugia code + NA codes (if you'd like)
Ok. Will start when i wake up in morning.
Hey there, just about to start your save file.
Can you please confirm a couple of things:

* Save creation date: 6th of July or 7th of June?
(I feel we may live in parts of the world that write them differently)
* Redemption dates: You are okay with them all being redeemed on the same day?
Or would you prefer different dates?
Hello, basler!
I'm sorry for replying late.
The date is 7th of June.
Yes, I am okay with them being redeemed on the same day.
No worries.
Will start when I get home from work.
I've done the first 3:

* Lax
* Timid
* Bold

Do you want to send the other 2 codes through please?
Codes sent!
Thanks for the Poipole codes as well :)
You're welcome and trade completed!

Summary: 
I can do that for 3 codes.
Yeah I can do saves.
Can you redeem JPN codes?
Yeah I can redeem on JPN Moon.
I can trade whatever code/s you need.
