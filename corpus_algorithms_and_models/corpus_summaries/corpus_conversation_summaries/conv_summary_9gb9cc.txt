Original Response: 
*traded at the deadline*
Re-signed next off season.
After receiving the captaincy.
I'm not even opposed to this.
What do you think he could fetch?
win win.
Depends on if he's once again on pace for a 20 goals season and how competitive the market is.
Optimistically, a late first, a good prospect (Ã  la Burrows) or a second and a b-prospect.
A 2nd at the deadline is most likely.
Bergevin usually fleeces someone at the deadline though, so maybe we can package him for something good, ala Weise/Fleischmann to Chicago.

A late first for Byron?
That's not far off one Erik Karlsson.

Summary:
