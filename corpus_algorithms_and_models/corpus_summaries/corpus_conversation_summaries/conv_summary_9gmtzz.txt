Original Response: 
Since NM is citing a violation of federal law, I imagine other states are watching closely and waiting to file there own lawsuits.
The outcome of this could be big.
Not necessarily, everyone knows where these efforts are moving, regulation and certification requirements for developers or studios.
This would be a death sentence for what's helped technology improve, accessibility.
It would create a massive talent shortage and that's why the industry is against these attempts.
By that I mean the people working in it, not the corporations necessarily.

I'm not understanding how this creates a talent shortage, can you explain further?

These are BAD business practices because it normalizes everyone into a statistic instead of focusing on individuals and the product.
This practice shifts the focus to the analytics being the Gods and the consumers being the product.
They can sell their data on you to other companies, countries, etc, to where there is a worship of sorts to get this data above all else.
Above their product development, above innovation and THIS IS WHAT IS STIFLING CREATIVITY!!

This is BS.
Everyone is an individual and analytics are an excuse to narrow the buying choices and views to what (((they))) want.
It always gets abused to cut out the creative music, creative films and documentaries and it is now a heavy form of censorship.
But it's based on "buying choices" of the marginal.
In a few generations of buildup and usage, these companies can completely wipe out whole portions of history just with the censorship of certain books, films, TV and media.
This is a DANGEROUS practice and the next form of thought police.
I want to watch Dark City, but if it doesn't reach past that "popularity bar" then why would (((they))) bother posting it?
Creativity is the ONLY thing that matters.
Being a horse trader/merchant where all you are doing is buying low and selling high with loads on"analytics" and paperwork, it's STILL the dumb playground for psychos to justify their existence by leaching off the creative and why not control them too by never allowing their product to get to market?
These are dangerous practices.
I dare say... Satanic.

*"Yes and no.
All products in the last couple centuries (that have been successful in anyway at least, aside from fidget spinners) use market research.
"* 

Define market research....  if you do, you will find it wanting for most ground breaking, cutting edge products.
Analytics and market research are very bad at **predicting** trends and innovation for they are lagging indicators and only tell you where you have been, not where you are going.
Engineers and artists know what is possible.
Marketing research and marketing experts are Monday morning quarterbacks.
Analytics and markets stare backwards in time.
Creators stare forward.
As the Qanon movement has proved, the predictive ability of analytics is of little use once the target realizes they are be analyzed and has sufficient self control to **confuse** or game the system.
&gt;The greatest bit of human arrogance is the idea that we as individuals are significantly unique or interesting enough to matter.
This smells of utopian Marxism/satanism.
Where did you receive your education/indoctrination?
The greatest bit of arrogance you, as an individual, have displayed, is an underdeveloped belief in your's and other's ability to create new, unique things, which by definition, makes your life and creations one-of-a-kind.
If you are not a BOT, you need to get  your butt out of the house and do things, and quit worrying about the what, the why, and how average psychologically crushed persons behavior is "SOOO predictable."
I feel as if you have relented and given in to your lot in life, and you cannot comprehend someone who has not.

I do appreciate your point and have on many occasions entertained the philosophy you have put forward.
I also appreciate your linking the ideas you have put forward to mine with a (sort of) unified theory of innovation.
Analytics and market research are no magic wand.
We all know the maxim *"past performance does not guarantee future results"* and we all also understand that most, (but not all) innovations were built on previous iterations and complied work of earlier masters and engineers, but **built on** is the operative words; not copied.
True Engineers, Artists and original thinkers have a very high skill set, which is necessary to implement their original ideas.
They use these skills to push the paradigm  further.
When the transistor was invented it was loosely linked to previous work and I believe no marketing campaign was used to determine the viability or marketability of the transistor.
There are also many cases of "leaps of logic" that are not close analogues or clones of previous inventions.
One last thing; the premise that many people are innovative, so innovativeness is not unique, is silly to say the least.
I hope that is not what you are pushing towards.
Actually, your data is backwards.
Let's take your own premise.
Adam and Eve.
If we all came from them, and now there are over 7 billion of us, then uniqueness is EXPANDING, not contracting.
Our genetics are unique, our fingerprints, not only are they unique, but unpredictable.
Analytics, AI, statistics cannot predict what the next generation's fingerprints will look like, in as much as analytics and "market research" cannot have enough fine-toothed data mining to predict what anyone will or will not do, period.
So, according to you, no one is unique?
Your mother?
Just another breeder according to you?
All your friends act the same and have the general same experiences that are so predictable as to always find "communal commonality."
Again, this is a reflection of you.
Where do you get your doctrines?
The Little Red Book of Sameness?
If there is no uniqueness, then there is no comedy in the world, because all comedy is based on finding that unique way of looking at the world that others cannot see and share in that perspective for a glimpse and laugh.
In your world, there is nothing that great about any invention or artist because it's based on something else and randomness is easily calculated.
Yes, artists, musicians, engineers struggle to learn, struggle to recreate what others have done before they stretch their wings and make their OWN mark.
That's what we are all here to do.
Not copy each other forever and just buy what Joe buys and worship Hollywood movies like Joe does, and buy Nike shoes because Colin Kaepernick is so cool.
The problem with your equation is that your comb of "unique" is too coarse.
Details are where you find that spark.
God is in the details.
Even you, with your writing and style, yes, may be mimicked, but it is still something that YOU made.
These are your thoughts; your unique perspective and addition to the whole grand universe, and yes, what God will judge you on in the end, if you believe in that sort of thing.
You wanting to strip the uniqueness out of the world just for the sake of proving that statistical data is valid is only to further prove that leeches can have jobs.
Leeches (that is what I call the zombie mind of a parasite,) these intelligent zombies have little creative spark... just the lust for control and larceny.
These intellectual zombies do nothing but regurgitate other's  thoughts and beliefs without taking a moment to reflect on themselves and how they actually add to the productive world, instead categorize everyone else into groups so they can feel safer and justify their creative impotence.
But in actuality, the world would not only not miss, but would be better off without them.
The world is getting more unique everyday and things are changing.
Soon, the creators will be the ones calling the shots again and the bean counters with all their analytics will be on the bottom.
The real, natural order of things.... and that just burns your beans, doesn't it?
For the most part the average Joe six-pack lives in a pigeon holed existence.
This existence or social-economic paradigm is driven by 3 things....
1) Intentionally limiting educational system which discourages free-thought and logic and encourages Conformity, Worship of Authority, and looking to the group for approval and status, (Prussian System).
2) Analytics (Surveillance State): those who put analytics and ego driven narcissism before ethics is a major problem with our current society.
This is taking the machinations of corporations and controlling factions of governments to imperial levels of stupidity.
De-basing humans to predictable little slaves for the elite (leeches) to dance on and not taking into account that *spark.
* &lt;---- you know, that thing that makes us unique, so the leeches can feel justified in "ruling over" us... 
3) Fake Money Supply: The Babylonian money magic, with their built-in model of theft, fraud and deception needs to go, (and is going, make no mistake,) through more and more options for people to do commerce without a bank, i.e.
- bitcoin, potcoin and the like.
To me, it seems like the world is going to have a major paradigm shift very soon.
And there is NOTHING that the leeches can do about it.

Summary: 
Analytics and market research are no magic wand.
The world is getting more unique everyday and things are changing.
Creativity is the ONLY thing that matters.
Analytics and markets stare backwards in time.
So, according to you, no one is unique?
Actually, your data is backwards.
