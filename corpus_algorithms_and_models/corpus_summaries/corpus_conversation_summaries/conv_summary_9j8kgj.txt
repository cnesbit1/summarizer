That was a nice first pitch.
How fast until the Angels strength and condition coaches destroy that guy's UCL?
We'll have to ask Ohtani San once he's well :((((
is he actually getting tommy john or whats the deal there?
Has their rotation ever been healthy at the same time?
Richards, Shoemaker, Skaggs, Ohtani.
You can only pick two at a time, apparently.
They probably lead the ducks when it comes to injuries..it's so sad.
Last I heard he underwent that surgery...man, what a first year run to conclude with that.
wasn't he still hitting dingers like 2 nights ago?
I  feel like his was singing despacito on the team bus like 24 hours ago.
The angels have done a great job at obfuscating what's happening with ohtani.
Surgery is scheduled for next week.
fack dude, I'm bummed.
Ohtani was so fun to watch.
Heâ€™ll still be batting next season, supposedly.

Summary: 
Ohtani was so fun to watch.
wasn't he still hitting dingers like 2 nights ago?
