Congratulations.
Thank you!
Is Christianity on the rise or fall in the Netherlands?
What about Islam?
Ehm.
Christianity is in slow decline, mostly due to secularisation, yet it holds enough cultural power in the country.
Sadly, Islam is growing due to immigration and converts.
&gt;converts

Elaborate... because if one hate what Christianity ask for, why would they want Islam?
Converts to Islam donâ€™t always come from Christianity as far as I know.
But what about agnostics, atheist, or people who dislike what Christianity stand for in their mind?
You assume that Christianity is on the fall because of muslims.
This is not the case.
I can say that as an ex christian.
Been 25 years Christian, now an Atheist though.
Most fall is due to that people becoming Atheists.
This is what i see all around us.
The Muslims are mostly immigrants and they are mostly muslim because of their family.
Some of them also become Atheist.
Muslim is on the rise, not because people convert but because foreign people coming here.
It's only a slight rise though.
People don't generily dislike Christians.
(I also don't dislike them, my family, friends and so on are Christian) They just grow out of it towards being Atheist.
Atheist are not evil.
I thought like that when i was a Christian.
But the Netherlands is a free society where you have the freedom to practise religion as long as it doesn't influence other peoples freedom.
I always scratch my head when I see white Europeans converting to Islam.
Especially if they came from atheism.

Summary: 
I can say that as an ex christian.
