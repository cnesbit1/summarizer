Original Response: 
This didn't happen today, rather 2 years ago.
I'm on mobile, you guys know the drill.
So while browsing this beautiful sub, I was suddenly reminded of the moment I discovered how low I can get as a human being.
Thinking back on it, it's kind of a funny story (and probably traumatizing for the poor kid and family involved), so since you guys have given me a lot of great stories, let me share mine.
I was 19 at the time and working in a shitty IT helpdesk job.
I just got off from work and I was going back home, anxious to get some food in my belly since it was 5pm and I haven't eaten since last night.
On my way back home, I get a call from my buddy.
"Yo cockmuncher, wanna grab some pizza and a drink or two at [insert places name]?"
My growling stomach and lack of a will to live at that point thanks to my job made the sound of both pizza and alcohol seem erotic.
"Fuck yeah, meet me there in 10 minutes"

10 minutes later and we got a seat and a beer at one of the outside tables.
Now this pizza place was a kind of bar/restaurant gig, with all the tables and chairs being outside.
They had the absolute best pizzas, cheap alcohol and a massive playground so it was routinely packed with families and students.
We start talking shit, downing our beers, smoking our lungs out and waiting for the pizzas to come out.
One other thing about this place: the pizzas take FOREVER.
The prep work on the pizzas alone probably takes them half an hour.
My buddy and I are on our third draft by the time the pizza comes.
But man I creamed myself when I did see them come.
We proceed to slam back our beers and dig in.
I down my entire brand new draft and feel the bubbles start to build up.
Uh oh.
I try to release the gas by burping but the bubbles are fizzing up faster than I can release them.
On top of that, thanks to me not eating all day as well, my stomach is beginning to fight back against me in protest from the lack of care I've been giving it.
This isn't looking good.
Being the concerned friend he was, my buddy proceeded to laugh and slap me on my back, hard.
And that bursts open the dam walls.
In order to not throw up on our still hot from the oven pizzas, I turn my head to the side and let it all out, unable to contain it any more.
All over the toddler who was sitting at the table with his family next to us.
All I hear is my friend wheezing in the background, and the giant fucking bear of a man father emitting an arse puckering "*WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO*"

I grab some napkins and try to stand up so I can help this crying kid deal with the aftermath of my poor life choices, but then it hit me.
First the alcohol, then papa bears fist.
I lose my footing and I swear my soul leaves my body for a second.
I rejoice, for mortal problems do not affect the dead.
I snap back a second later and curse God and Satan for not taking me when they had the chance.
Papa bear is standing over me and is about to smash his meaty fists into my face once again, and my drunken mind isn't gonna stand for it.
In a drunken fury I rolled to the side of his pavement-smashing fist and stood up, my rage and adrenaline momentarily burning away the last few beers.
And we spar.
It lasts about 5 seconds before he picks me up like I was a toy and throws me against the wall.
By this point the manager and a few of the beefier staff have arrived.
Seeing that I'm already no longer a threat considering I got thrown like a dirty cum rag against the wall, they focus on papa bear.
After he had about 5 guys clinging to his limbs and trying to restrain him, he decides he's over me and goes back to his still-crying kid and frantic wife.
I was then promptly picked up by the staff, carried out of the establishment and firmly told that I will be arrested on site if I come back.
Supposedly after the incident they implemented a "no under 21s allowed unless with parent supervision" rule.
TL;DR got drunk off beer with an empty stomach, projectile vomited onto a toddler, fist fought the dad, got banned from the establishment and got every other person under 21 banned as well unless with supervision.
**Edit:** for those of you asking "how the hell did you get alcohol at 19?
", I live in a country that's legal drinking age is 18

**Edit 2:** Obligatory *ThIsBlEwUp* edit, wow 10k updoots!
At least I got some sweet karma out of this, almost makes going a whole year without the best pizza in the city worth it!
All while the friend kicks back and enjoys pizza with a show.
Yep, what a good mate.
Then again, I did puke on the guys kid...
He just wanted to grab his pint and wait for it all to blow over.
He kinda unknowingly caused the whole mess.
Oops, just a friendly slap on the back!
Man had a plan.
A fucking good one hahaha.
Oh no, he knew what he did.
Fucker knew.
Shaun of the dead reference FTW.
A real friend would have joined the fight.
Yeah but he's no real friend.
He's a best friend.
So he just sat back pissing himself laughing hahaha.
At the Winchester.
But it did blow over...


...*all over the baby.
*
At the Winchester no less.
i was gonna call bullshit when you started on about how you sobered up and fought a man twice your size but then you got thrown accross the room so it sounded ok again.
So you are from Australia I am guessing?
Ever listen to Acca Dacca en Macas?
Hahaha, yeah alcohol really does make you feel invincible until mortality slaps you in the fucking face.
Nope, South African but I'll listen to them now!
Pretty good band mate.
Check 'em out.
Definitely, thanks mate!
Thrown across the room like a “dirty cum rag”, no less....that was actually my favourite line in the whole story....
Your mate had it planned all the way down to picking a table next to a baby, whose parents he subtly invited by putting pizza vouchers for cheap Friday night pizza in their mailbox, on their windshields and kitchen counter for a week.
He also dosed your beer with Ipecac, shot out the tyres of the food delivery truck earlier that morning on a lonely stretch of a road outside of town to slow the prep process for the day and slapped a note on your back about how you fucked the pizzeria's daughter last week in an uncomfortable place.
Damn, he's a cleverer fucker than I thought!
Where is this pizza place?
Fellow south African looking for good pizza and cheap beer.
Picolinos Pizza up in Gauteng, fucking amazing pizzas.
Holy shit, i drive past there every day when I go to work, never been before but I will definitely check it out now.
Haha damn you should definitely check it out!
The pizza there is amazing!
What's the best pizza to order?
Any special must haves?
It's kind of a pick your own free toppings kinda deal, but always remember to add the pizza spice, it doesn't taste half as nice without that!
r/nocontext.
you.
i like you.
&amp;#x200B;
those things puke on themselves all the time.
Aint no big thing.
What?
Like the back of a volkswagen?
Its not the worst thing To blow all over a baby.
What's the big deal?
Babies puke on themselves all the time.
And somehow in all this you're the asshole?
"I don't know him, he had a Groupon."
Who should we tell them sent us there?
Just give them a TL;DR version of the tale and hope  it’s the same manager?
Ah, damn, I was gonna guess Straya as well!
In Australia we don't have cheap alcohol.
Saw that line and instantly knew it wasn't here (surprisingly are one of few places that is 18 instead of 21 for drinking)
Because he stuck to the wall.
Thought so.
Now look what you did - they want to raise the legal drinking age here to 21 because kids get drunk and do stupid things.
Considering your location I now need to know the name of this delicious pizza place?
That was pretty good but imo “I swear my soul leaves my body for a second.
I rejoice, for mortal problems don’t affect the dead.
I snap back a second later and curse god and Satan for not taking me when they had the chance.” Was the best part.
With “arse puckering” being a third haha.
My mate said this to me years ago when I asked him how he hit on women.
"Don't be the guy getting drunk, be the guy laughing at it".
Everyone else looks like an idiot, and you're still Mr smooth, you get to watch the drunk people as entertainment.
makes sense.
Meet you down The Winchester?
Also r/nocontext.
You've got red on you.
Eating disorder brain: BUT WHAT WAS THE VOMIT

Haaaa.
Why didn't you demand money?..that baby ate your pizza cocktail...
And you even chewed the food for the baby

Just kidding..you deserved some punishments.
Right, but you didn't do it *intentionally.
* Violence was an unethical response to an unintended act.
Vomiting was something that happened *to you*, you didn't choose to do it.
