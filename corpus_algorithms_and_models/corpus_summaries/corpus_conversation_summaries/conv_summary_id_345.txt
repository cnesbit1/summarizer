Looking for a place to rent or someone to rent an apartment with me.
I know it might be a long shot but I would really like a clean roommate for once in my life, I'm a 23 year old male, very quiet and I keep to myself most of the time.
I drink from time to time but I don't get loud or sloppy.I would perfer around crosstown so somewhere near weber would be perfect.I don't do any drugs and I don't smoke.
I keep up on cleaning and am very respectful of my roomates.Maybe someone I can relate with or get along with, my current roommates are slobs, I don't really relate with them at all, and our personalities clash.I would prefer someone without a animal worse case maybe a cat or a reptile.
I make about 24k a year which isn't incredible but that just means I can pay rent and i have never missed a payment.
Communal gaming would be awesome, I tend to play pc but thinking of getting a console.Feel free to comment any questions or directly message me and we will see ðŸ‘€.
