I’m pretty sure r/mma would shut down permanently before they chose a side in a Colby vs Punk debate.

Maybe I missed it, but what racist things has he said?
I know he called Brazilians animals but shit they act like it at fights.
Brazillian isn't even a race.
Never understood the racism accusations without proof.

You'll pull something.

So you're saying HR was wrong and I CAN call my Mexican coworkers wetbacks and it's totally not racist?
Looks like this guy no longer has to go to sensitivity training.

Hmmm..  Are you joking or what?
Mexican also isn't a race.
But calling them Wetbacks would still be deragtory and prejudice not to mention hateful.
You are aware you can still be hateful towards a person or people and not change the definition of racism.
He didn’t use a racial slur though....I’ve been to a Philadelphia Eagles game.
Their fans act like animals.
Does that make me racist?

Not surprised you're getting downvoted to oblivion.
Conor literally called black people monkeys in an interview and the sub somehow pretended he meant they were monkeys in a non racist way and everyone calling him racist was just a hater.

Evidently the only thing racist to r/mma is saying you don't like Woodley, lmaoo.
So many mental gymnastics.
Lmao I was at +7 last time I checked this comment.
Good ole r/mma.
This sub has a lot more subconscious lingering racism than it cares to admit.
how was he racist fuckwad?
To be fair I never called him a fuckwad.
But that’s a good addition tbh.
I totally should have.
The UN's definition of racism literally includes ethnic groups fam.

Being Brazillian also isn't an ethnic group.
Have you ever seen an option for "Brazillian" under Ethnicity in a form?
He was calling you a fuckwad, fuckwad.
Oh, well then; no u.

Summary: 
how was he racist fuckwad?
