Original Response: 
When you take this fact and cross-check with what GCT said about Edwin Tong, one wonders how much pay cut Edwin actually took to become minister.
It's obviously not 2 MIO become 500K like what GCT said.
I doubt the pay cut is really that much maybe 10-20% max.
According to an old interview with Shanmugum who was also a lawyer, he was paying more income tax than the minister salary he is currently getting.
He did not outright reply that this was true though all he said was his pay cut was substantial.
Not sure why you think this is relevant.
The issue at hand is that GCT seems to be fibbing about the facts.
Because U stated yourself that U don't know how much Edwin Tong pay was cut

Both Edwin Tong and Shanmugam are high flying lawyers before their appointment as minister so their pay scale we can assume is quite similar.
Shanmugam as a full minister is getting a lot higher pay vs what Edwin is getting now so by extension if Shanmugam took a massive pay cut as a full minister, the pay cut taken by Edwin should be similar if not higher since he is getting lower a lower pay now.
FFS.
GCT said Edwin Tong was making 2 million you dimwit.
The part that i'm not sure is I'm not sure what's his exact bonus and exact pay.
Go fuck off somewhere else.
Just because U failed to communicate properly and failed to google doesn't mean U have to be rude to others

Edwin Tong is a minister of state so his salary is around $1.02M with AWS and 3 month bonus and 3 months performance bonus.
He took a $900K pay cut assuming it is true that he earned $2M a year previously.
So 40-50%, GCT wasn't making it up

https://www.gov.sg/~/sgpcmedia/media_releases/pmo-psd/press_release/P-20180301-1/attachment/Annex%20B%202017%20Review%20Committee%20Report.pdf.
the part he's talking about is where GCT claimed Tong took a 75% pay cut to make about 500k as an SMS ([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cut-pay-for-ministers-spore-will-pay-price-esm-goh](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cut-pay-for-ministers-spore-will-pay-price-esm-goh)).
Btw, i don't think the recommended has kicked in yet so benchmark should be 935k still.
Based on this article's 11.85 months average in 2017 that'd work out to be 935/20 \* 23.85 = 1.115mil.
Basically GCT said SMS makes about 500k a year but turns out it's more than double that.
FFS.
I was rude because i have no time for idiots.
Firstly - Fuck you: 

&gt;Edwin Tong, he is a Senior Counsel, he earns more than $2 million.
PM asked him to be a Minister of State – one quarter (salary).
He came to see me.
He said, at this stage of his life, he has got a house, he has got a mother-in-law to support, a father-in-law to support, his own parents and so on, what should he do?
So I asked him, Edwin, what were you in politics for?
(He said) Here to serve.
So I said you’ve got to serve, well, you know between $2 million and perhaps half a million, later on you hopefully become a full Minister, $1 million, you have to decide which is more important.
So Edwin told me his job in politics is to serve.
He said yes, I will take on, and he felt very strongly that he could do the job.
But now we dare not pay Ministers a good wage.
Secondly - Double fuck you

Your own link says: 


Mid-year and year-end payments paid to civil servants
based on Singapore’s economic performance.
As with
current civil service practice, the AVC ranges from 0 to
1.5 months.
A typical AVC is 1 month.
In years of
exceptional economic performance, a one-off Special
Variable Payment can also be made.
Performance Bonus Varies with individual performance and is determined
by PM.
It ranges from 0 to 6 months and good
performers will typically get 3 months.
National Bonus Based on four socio-economic indicators with equal
weights.
No bonus is paid if the minimum levels of
achievement for the indicators are not met.
A bonus of
3 months will be paid if the targets for the four
indicators are met.
A maximum bonus of 6 months will
be paid if targets are far exceeded.
Please read your own fucking link before coming out and guai laning people.
His pay will be around 3 months performance, 1 month AWS, 3 months National bonus.
Average minister total bonus is actually around 11 months btw.
Assuming his base pay of 1 MIO it's actually pretty close to 2 MIO.
I ALREADY FUCKING SAID THE PAY CUT MAY BE AROUND 10-20% EARLIER.
NOT WHAT GCT SAID ABOUT 2 MIO VS 500K.
Ok thanks.
I feel better now.
** edit **

I am a fucking idiot and I deserve a kick in the face by you instead.
Just to clarify, the benchmark salary is not base pay but actually based on 20 months, 12 months + 13th month + 1 AVC, 3 months PB, 3 months NB.
It's projected based on a average year with average bonuses included.
SMS benchmark is 935k currently, so 11.85 months bonus = 935/20 \* 23.85 = 1.115m total.
Thus Tong's paycut from the claimed 2 mil would be almost 45%.
Definitely not 75%, but also not 10-20% either.

I learnt something new.
So using this logic, the base pay is actually around 500K?
Which means GCT is actually not too far off.
But of course not including the bonus portion is a bit sly.
But then to be fair he probably said it off the cuff so some slack should be given.
I don't get where 23.85&lt;- comes from

Where in the world did U get 11.85 from???
The article stated that annual salary component is 12 Months + 1 Month AWS + 3 Months performance Bonus + 3 months National Bonus(see pt 17)

Basically his annual salary is $1,020,000(I'm using the higher recommended value) which comprise of 13 months + 3 months performance and 3 months variable bonus

Actual annual + AWS is $1.2M/19 months * 13 = $697K -  65% pay cut
If we take the lower value of $935K  = $639K - 68% pay cut

While GCK was a bit off with his 75% pay cut, he wasn't that far off

Even if we assume the best case scenario where they get 100% bonus, he still took a massive 50% pay cut as opposed to your assumption of 10-20% max.
BTW average minister bonus received is 4.5 months.
The 12 months basic is 561k, but shit performance + gdp in the dumps also will get 13th month so 607k is the bare minimum.
Average minister bonus is 4 months over the last 5 years
https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/political-office-holders-received-average-performance-bonus-of-4-months-salary-in-last-five

U got angry with me because of your own wrong calculations.
FFS.
That's just the performance bonus.... Goodness seriously people don't read fine print anymore?
&gt; BTW average minister bonus received is 4.5 months

average PERFORMANCE bonus.
Dude, you yourself acknowledged that there are other bonus components....
This is actually the reason why I hate this whole minister salary talk.
It's not the quantum, it's how PAP has been trying their darnest to obfuscate facts.
I actually admire GCT's balls to just say we need to pay ministers high pay to get quality people.
This concept in itself isn't wrong, but perhaps the implementation does leave something to be desired.
Case in point, I'm not very convinced that Edwin Tong or Son of Punggol are actually quality.
Same goes for CCS.
Okay, the annual salary component = 12 months + 1 AVC + 3 PB + 3 NB.
Plus one more month for 13th month.
\&gt; The annual salaries comprise fixed pay of 13 months (monthly salary and 13th month bonus) and variable pay of 7 months (1 month AVC, 3 months Performance Bonus and 3 months National Bonus).
The benchmark of either 935k or 1.02mil is based on 20 months salary.
In the OP article there's a table allegedly from PSD that gives the actual bonuses at 11.85 months for 2017 average.
(It's the 2nd table in the article)

23.85 = 12 months basic + 11.85 months bonus.
(13th mo + 4.5 PB + 1.5 AVC + 5.25 NB)

Your actual annual is based on absolutely no bonuses paid out at all, i.e.
pure 13 months salary, in which the figures are almost correct but not quite because you're dividing by 19 when it should be 20 (cos' it includes 13th month).
The average minister bonus received being 4.5months is solely  for Performance bonus (PB component), and does not include the alleged 1.5 months AVC or 5.25 months NB, nor the 13th month.
So it depends on whether your definition of actual annual salary means just basic fixed pay or included bonuses.
If the former, then yes about 600k, if the latter then more than 1mil.
&gt;you dimwit.
Dr Nacht?
&gt;U 

And always defending gahmen.
PaperMate?
That's only the performance bonus, not total bonus.
And that's what the article is about.
Make it seem like they don't pay themselves that much bonus.
&gt; se U failed to communicate properly and failed to google doesn't mean U have to be rude to others
&gt; 
&gt; Edwin Tong is a minister of state so his salary is around $1.02M with AWS and 3 month bonus and 3 months performance bonus.
He took a $900K pay cut assuming it is true that he earned $2M a year previously.
So 40-50%, GCT wasn't making it up

I'm defending facts.
I seem to be defending the govt a lot because those opposing the govt usually do so by distorting facts.
U are free to point out the errors of my argument if I get it wrong but there is a fact is a fact

Fact is the guy was wrong.
He claim that Edwin Tong at best took a 10-20% pay cut.
Assuming the info that Edwin Tong's previous salary as a lawyer is $2M.
His base pay as a SMS is plus AWS is $690K representing a 68% pay cut.
At the very best if he get full bonus his salary is cap at $1.02M he would still be seeing his salary halved

Those who complain that our ministers are in it for the money are either clueless or stupid.
If they were all in it for the money, many of them wouldn't have joined politics in the first place.

Summary: 
Plus one more month for 13th month.
BTW average minister bonus received is 4.5 months.
A typical AVC is 1 month.
That's only the performance bonus, not total bonus.
Average minister total bonus is actually around 11 months btw.
Make it seem like they don't pay themselves that much bonus.
So I asked him, Edwin, what were you in politics for?
Dude, you yourself acknowledged that there are other bonus components....
He claim that Edwin Tong at best took a 10-20% pay cut.
GCT said Edwin Tong was making 2 million you dimwit.
So using this logic, the base pay is actually around 500K?
But now we dare not pay Ministers a good wage.
His pay will be around 3 months performance, 1 month AWS, 3 months National bonus.
(He said) Here to serve.
&gt; BTW average minister bonus received is 4.5 months

average PERFORMANCE bonus.
