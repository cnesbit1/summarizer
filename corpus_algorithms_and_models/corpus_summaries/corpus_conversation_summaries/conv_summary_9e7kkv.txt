A good plan for creating social outcast ghetto zones that becomes a dumping ground for social problems.
Another stupid plan that is not backed up by planning, resources and infrastructure.
When the regional areas become liveable and viable for ordinary Australians then it will become viable for economic migrants.
Another weasle plan to save votes before an election where the majority of Australians have had enough of uncontrolled immigration  thats being forced down our throats without planning nor infrastructure.
A plan that they want to repeat in the Bush, standby for the homeless people sleeping in the main street of Orange!
&gt; uncontrolled immigration

This is not a thing Australia has, not even close.

Melbourne's population is going to double in 40 years.
Does this seem controlled to you?
Yes.
People who think their country has 'uncontrolled immigration' have categorically never tried to immigrate to their country.
I think by "uncontrolled" you really mean "is at a level I don't agree with".
That's a different conversation.
Plus given good planning and infrastructure what's wrong with doubling in size?
Melbourne is something like FIVE TIMES!!!!!!
the size of Adelaide yet you don't see people fleeing Melbourne for Adelaide quite the opposite.
I am a migrant.
It really isn't a different conversation.
We have a level of migration that no longer benefits people who live here, and it's just being used as a tool to inflate the price of housing and keep wages flat-lined.
It's an absolute fantasy that Melbourne can build sufficient infrastructure in 40 years to maintain our current quality of life with twice as many people.
&gt; I am a migrant.
Remember when you just got on a plane, got to the airport in Sydney, and they just let you in with no visa, no vetting, all uncontrolled like?
No?
Me neither, I recall having to pay a huge wack of cash, fill out paperwork for hours, get police and health checks from every country I'd lived in for the last decade, get character statements from Australian friends, and a bunch of other stuff.
Felt pretty controlled to me.
&gt; We have a level of migration that no longer benefits people who live here

25 minutes after the first immigrant came to Australia I bet they said the same thing.
And it keeps getting repeated but this time I bet your right.
&gt; and it's just being used as a tool to inflate the price of housing and keep wages flat-lined

That people blame immigrants for housing prices is frankly stupid.
Australia has an absolute fetish about owning as many homes as you can, gotta get in on that 'passive income'.
Blaming immigrants is a forest for the trees problem.
Sure they account for a tiny portion of demand and probably a huge portion of the demand for luxury housing but the problem is almost exclusively a decade of low interest rates, interest only mortgages, and locals taking advantage of those market conditions.
&gt; and it's an absolute fantasy that Melbourne can build sufficient infrastructure in 40 years to maintain its prior quality of life to cope with a doubling of population

Why?
40 years ago what was Melbourne's population?

Every property investor I've ever met has attributed price rises to the endless demand that comes from rapid population growth.
Even if they are all wrong for some unknown reason, the belief that more demand for property raises prices is pushing housing prices up.

Population growth is a global problem.
Most of the worlds serious issues are founded on our population growth and unrealistic expectations that we can continue to do so.
Our economic system demands constant growth and expansion of some percentage or another.
And when you start talking about 7 billion people, it doesnâ€™t take much of a percentage point before you are talking about big numbers.
We live within an environment of mostly finite resources yet continue to tell ourselves that we can always get more.
Not a new argument but surely it needs to be addressed.

During the past 5 years under the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison Government:

- Our population increased by 1.88 Million.
- Our Immigrant yearly intake ceiling has increased to 190K.
We don't currently have the infrastructure to cope with these numbers.
Every property investor you've ever met?
That such a class of people exist is the reason prices are sky rocketing.
Well, that and interest rates.
Prices are set by what people can afford to carry and that is set by interest rates.
Immigrants share some responsibility for rising prices but most of it comes from speculators/investors and cheap money.
But it is easy to blame 'Them' it is much hard to look "every property investor [you've] ever met" in the eye and say 'hey buddy, you speculating on housing and buying a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th home is the reason my kids can't afford to live near me'.
Domestic problems being blamed on Mexicans, how very American of you.
Figured Aussie's were smarter then that.
Migrants create jobs they don't steal them.
Get your facts straight.
Homes literally grow on trees and employ people to build that you saw a homeless person does not mean there is a housing shortage.
That homes are expensive is a product of domestic speculation, how many true blue battlers do you know that own more than one home?
Also low interest rates, actually mostly low interest rates.
Schools I know less about, maybe if you guys didn't have such a shitty public/private lowbrid system going that wouldn't be an issue.
That you think a big productive first world country can't absorb less then 1% of its population each year speaks to your lack of imagination not this countries actual abilities.

Yes, mate, I want a house, and so do people to migrate to Australia, they all want houses, and property investors know that so they buy up the houses and hope to sell them to us subsequently for a higher price than they bought when the unsatisfied demand has pushed up the prices.
Property investors, low interest rates, population growth resulting in the majority part from migration, a government obsessed with tax breaks for property investors and keeping migration high, these are all factors pushing up house prices, and none of them can be discounted.
&gt; Domestic problems being blamed on Mexicans, how very American of you.

Yawn.
Accuse racism next, if you want to be a stereotype.
Ignoring reality doesn't imply being raciest.
Not sure what you are on about.
If you ended migration today and kept all else equal property prices wouldn't budge.
And the economy would suffer in the medium and long term.
If you added 1% the every new mortgage issued instead housing prices would crater.
Or if you rejigged your tax system to make owning multiple properties very unattractive it would have the same effect as increasing the mortgage rate.
The "solution" to housing has nothing to do with immigration.
It is just a bunch of people's favorite whipping boy.
"Ohhh, they took your jerbs, houses, and women".

You're absolutely wrong.
The business case for property investment would receive a devastating hit if population growth was to end (which it would, because we have a below replacement birth rate).
Look at Japan, since the 80s bubble, their property prices have never recovered, never even come close.
There's no reason for Japanese people to suppose that demand for property will rise again when their population is actually dropping.

Nah, you're just wrong, mate.
You want to believe immigration has no negative effects, because you're really pro-immigration.
But you're wrong, wrong, wrong.
Just have a look at what the RBA has to say: https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2015/sep/pdf/bu-0915-3.pdf.
Migrants create jobs for themselves.
They don't create additional jobs for current residents.
Also, 1% of population each year is 10% in 10 years.
And that compounds.
[removed]
pity you only have 2 parents to share with us.
&gt; How can you create a job that doesnt exist.
Wait, are you serious?
How are there any jobs at all?
I was unaware Australia was issued XXXXX jobs no more, no less, never to get any more.
Not sure what the jab at my post history is trying to prove?
Oh noes, someone defending migration as good for Australia the horror.
So what if essentially every economist agrees, and it has historically born out that way.
This time is different!!

Nice rant.
As someone who has worked in both the government and private sides of immigration over ~15 years, I can tell you that right now is the hardest it has been (in those 15 years) to migrate to Australia (unless you have an Australian partner, the process now is virtually the same although even that is getting tightened up shortly).
I appreciate there are a lot out there who don't agree with the way immigration was being conducted between 2002 - 2012 (where it was basically getting warm bodies in due to the resources boom) but what you're saying here doesn't bear any kind of relation to the current migration program settings.

Where do you live?
Canada?
&gt; We don't currently have the infrastructure to cope with these numbers

Says who?
I live in Adelaide, I moved here from a real medium sized city.
Folks here complain about traffic and overcrowding and they are out to lunch.
So you'll forgive me if random internet guy quoting some numbers isn't going to get taken seriously.
The yearly intake is less then 1% of the population and it is easily manageable for the next several decades without any issues.
Though it would be nice if city governments got with the program and stopped being car and backyard obsessed.
Why?
The rest of your post was baseless gibberish.
&gt; Oh unless you mean are willing to work for less but better than you recieved in your previous country under the table then complain when you get shafted as history proves monthly.
What % of immigrants don't take real jobs?
1%, less?
What % move here and work for the same or less then they did back home?
Immigrants don't steal jobs and don't generally drive down wages of skilled jobs.
If you dropped out of high school, which you may have, then you could have a problem but even then it isn't a large one it is just statistically noticeable.
Adelaide.

Right, you think every migrant to Australia works under the table and that they don't start companies and add jobs to the economy.
I side with pretty much every economic study done regarding immigration.
Also with the history of essentially every western country.
Yet I'm the one spouting gibberish.
Perhaps you should sit down and have a think about that.
Maybe try a set of first year uni courses out.
History, Sociology, and Economics are all particularly enlightening.

No, not me.
Canada does though.
It's great with 10 million more people then Australia.
Or the US with 350 million.
Though the Canada comparison is more apt.
Not that this conversation matters Australia's been full since before there was the internet and here we are, it still isn't full and the world hasn't collapse.
And none of those links say anything about the thing I asked about.
&gt; We don't currently have the infrastructure to cope with these numbers

I wasn't questioning the numbers just your incorrect interpretation.
So let's increase our yearly intake to 2 Million?
Within 5 years we'd be able to reach Canada's current population.
Wages have stagnated while productivity has increased.
I assume you've got some reason for this that doesn't involve increasing population?

Melbourne's population is going to double in 40 years.
