Original Response: 
Why are anti-immigration and racists lumped together in the same sentence?
Anti-immigration is a completely valid political view, just as pro-immigration is.
They are not synonymous.
A person can be against *more* immigration.
But now in this overly PC western culture, somehow if you aren't PRO immigration, you are a racist.
I think because usually the people **asking for less immigration** usually come across as **screaming for no immigrants** just for the sake of it.
So when other people see that, they look like hateful bigots and racists hence the two become synonymous with each other.
Usually it's the right that argues for it, not always.
I think the problem is that the right and the left either don't know how to come across as moderate in their views enough to Garner a decent dialogue, OR the media always spins it in a way that the viewer see it as extreme opinions and policies and remove any and all context.
It entirely depends on the reason someone is anti-immigration.
&gt; I think because usually the people asking for less immigration usually come across as screaming for no immigrants just for the sake of it.
There are plenty of reasonable and calm anti-immigration proponents but they dont get any air time.
On the other hand, showing crazy racists ranting gets lost of clicks so the media shows tons of that.
Because if you just paint someone as a racist, you don't have to address their arguments.
&gt; Why are anti-immigration and racists lumped together in the same sentence?
Because it's brutally effective.
Unfortunately there's more than enough people around who refuse to acknowledge anything that questions our immigration system and why or how we do things as anything less than xenophobic racist bigotry, etc.
Its page 17 of the "emotional child's guide to political debate"
That's why people who are against immigration need to be more specific about what they are against and not just say they are anti-immigration because people paint broad strokes.
My point being that there's plenty of users here who simply will not acknowledge it.
Doesn't matter how thoughtfully you lay out your opinion or perspective, they'll just call you a Russian troll or spit something about  'Canadian values' at you in between bouts of frothing at the mouth about your supposed racism.
The problem is so much deeper than this.
It stems from many Candian's sense of patriotism.
To them being a Canadian patriot is being different from America.
For the last few decades Toronto has been 'the most multicultural city in the world', we grew up with 'good immigrants' in the 70s and 80s, and Americans are a lot softer on immigration so being 'pro immigration' is the patriotic Canadian thing to do.
However, Canadians hate the word patriotism because they also think it's American so if you are an unpatriotic Canadian you become a racist or bigot.
Trudeau used this sense of patriotism to the max in the last election.
Tough on crime that's an American thing we won't do that; anti-immigration also American; loosening environmental regulations also American; gender inequality a problem America doesn't want to address; legalizing marijuana nationally, America won't do that etc.
His entire platform was about differentiating his policies from America and pointing out how American the conservatives policies were.
This resonates a lot with the people who get their sense of patriotism from being different from Americans.
So, in Canada if you want to argue for a policy that is similar to America's but different from Canada's you become an unpatriotic Canadian aka racist or bigot north of the border.
[Case and point.

they shouldn't need to be more specific because of the people that slander them, but those people are increasingly discrediting themselves so it's fine.
I value immigration restrictions not at all.
It is a right of all people and any attempt by anyone to forcefully stop people from peacefully migrating is fundamentally wrong and I do not make any attempt at defending those who oppose them.
If a citizen would be given something by me, perhaps support for directorship in a cooperative, I'd give the same support for an immigrant, documented or not.
&gt;That's why people who are against immigration need to be more specific about what they are against

**No** people should not have to go around saying what they *aren't* and they shouldn't have to attach caveats to everything they say......and besides a lot of the time it doesn't matter anyway since some people will still insist he/she is still a racist anyway.
People shouldn't just leap to the conclusion of racism and the benefit of the doubt should be given to your fellow citizen.
Mind sharing your qualms with immigration then?
Because it depends on your reasoning for being anti-immigration, as well as the implementation you’re demanding... 

Canada needs immigration to make up for the declining birth rates, otherwise we’ll suffer the problem Japan is suffering.
If you’re against immigration then, you have to have a *really* good reason for why you’re against it, otherwise it just comes across as you choosing feelings over evidence, and those feelings are lumped into xenophobia.
What’s more is, the implementation matters.
“Screening” immigrants for “Canadian values” sounds dangerously close to the thought policing that many Conservatives insist that Liberals keep doing.
It’s vague enough that a single government can justify screening whoever and whenever to appease their racist base, which is why we’re so against it.
I too think that there needs to be some way to screen immigrants.
I’m just saying it needs to be based on evidence rather than feelings.
It's not about saying what they aren't for but saying what they actually are for.
Because these days 99% of anti-immigration sentiments are said by people who have racist, sectarian, misogynistic, and homophobic sentiments.
In 2012 I strongly supported deportation of illegal immigrants, and a moderate reduction in the rate of legal immigration.
But these days, with what's going on in the states, the racist anti-immigration crowd has drowned out the non-racist anti-immigration crowd.
For every Mitt Romney there are 100,000 David Dukes.
If neo-nazis suddenly started wearing grapefruit peels on their heads, it would become associated with racism.
Then all the non-racist people who just happen to enjoy wearing grapefruit peels on their heads would stop doing it.
People will make assumptions about you based on things you say.
I am pro-gun and anti-illegal immigration.
But I don't say it in public because people will assume racism, misogyny, fundamentalist Christianity, homophobia.
The fundie Christians and the racists have inserted themselves so prominently in the pro-gun and anti-immigration lobby that they make up 99% of those who say it.
So I don't blame centrists and progressives from making statistical assumptions.
I blame the racists for poisoning the conversation.
If the alt-wrong had never existed we could have reasonable, center-right conservatives talk about moderate reductions in immigration.
But now the alt-wrong have drowned out the center-right.
If other people misinterperet you it's possibly because more specifics are needed.
When you're surrounded by racists it helps to be more specific to make you stand out from the crowd.
Which is why I'm so baffled about Bernie.
He's very much against open borders, but at the same time a socialists' wet dream.
This tells me that you have to be vehemently anti-white at home in order to be allowed to have any kind of anti-immigration stance.
Well, my understanding of conventional immigration is that our system is pretty fuckin' awesome.
I was under the impression that it's tough to get into the country, and that you need to have money and/or skills.
Things like the TFW program, though...
Not the person you asked.
https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thehouse/why-the-governor-of-the-bank-of-canada-worries-about-your-debt-1.4372779/minister-says-300-000-new-immigrants-a-year-is-canada-s-new-normal-1.4375839

&gt;"As a government we went from 260,000 to 300,000 because of the need to meet the demands of Canadian families who wanted to reunite with their loved ones," Hussen continued.
"But also employers who are asking us to allow them to continue to use immigration more and more as a way to meet their growth needs."
These two reason I disagree with.
The first reason is moral and doesn't help our country in my opinion since we area already having a hard time taking care of our aging Canadian population.
For the second reason it's the same reason we have the TFW program.
Because companies are not willing to pay higher wages they just seek to get people to work for what they're willing to pay.
I can see where you're getting at.
I always wondered, however, why some Canadians on the right have such a hate on for the left, Liberals, Trudeau, pick a demon, that they side so heavily with American foreign and trade policy they will hurt Canada.
But it's okay because it shows "their side" as winning.
I call that traitorous behavior.
Anti immigration is a euphemism for “we only want white people here”.

&gt; they look like hateful bigots and racists hence the two become synonymous with each other.
This is why, before I wade into a conversation about immigration, I punch myself in the testes several times in succession while muttering *curse this putrid Aryan genome of mine* so as to prove a I am not a nationalist, I just believe in sane immigration rules.
Being so close and similar to one another makes it easy to observe and not make the same mistakes they make.
That's why Canadians choose to not do things the American way.
Oh yes I agree, signs that contain no English in an Ontario ethnic enclave that coincidentally has the highest auto insurance rates in the province is pretty fuckin' awesome.
Would you like to try to say something relevant?
[deleted]
It will be interesting to see what plan B is now that the overreach on plan A has become obvious to so many.
And he/she may be a racist.
People also need to stop acting like most of the world is altruistic and accept that many people are actually simply racist, with or without knowing it.
I agree that being against immigration isn't racist, but it seems that every  person I talk to who expresses those beliefs never fails to say something racist along with it.
You can see after a while why people would correlate those things.
[removed]
&gt;  since we area already having a hard time taking care of our aging Canadian population.
This is the primary reason we need immigration.
We need more young people to pay for the care of the increasing number of old people.
Without immigration, our population will decline and the proportion of that is older will increase.
It also leads to economic growth, but it seems to suppress wages slightly, so there is a limit to how much of a generally good thing we should allow.
Immigrants are good for the economy in the long run, especially in a relatively low population country like ours.
That aging population that you refer to needs to be replaced, and most of us aren't having enough kids.
Why don't we do the same with the UK?
We're arguably more similar to them.
Because being different from the British doesn't give any sense of patriotism.
&gt; This is the primary reason we need immigration.
We need more young people to pay for the care of the increasing number of old people.
Without immigration, our population will decline and the proportion of that is older will increase.
&gt; 

Ah yes, the ponzi scheme in action.
It's not like our city centers have crumbling infrastructure and housing problems already?
that's overly generous to the people typically making the very ungenerous and disingenuous accusations of racism.
"I only want to afford a house here and dont want wages to stagnate for the poorest Canadians because corporations like Timmys and McDonalds are too cheap to give Canadians livable wages so they abuse the TFW program by hiring Filipinos who live in modern day serfdom and dont complain because if they do they will be fired and sent back to the Philippines."
[removed]
“I blame immigrants for problems caused by corporations, but conveniently only the non white immigrants”.
More people, leading to more economic growth means more tax revenue to invest in infrastructure and affordable housing.
It can't continue forever, because eventually the population of the whole world will stabilize and then gradually decline unless something fundamental changes, but that is a long way off.
In the meantime, moderate levels of immigration keep our economy growing, and that really is better for just about everyone.
For sure but does it have to be 300k a year?
&gt;This is the primary reason we need immigration.
Never said we didn't.
Debating the number.
Did I say I didnt blame corporations?
I havent given either of those two shit corps my money in at least 3 years at the least.
But sure, according to you I must hate non-white people despite the fact that I am not white!
You can even check my Reddit history if you want.
Go take your racism back to the shithole that it belongs to on /r/politics.
The number is open for debate.
Based on available evidence, 1% of population seems to be a pretty good number, but it is completely legitimate to present evidence and arguments for it being greater or lesser than that.
So that ~12% increase is the point where it gets too high then?
The problem is that you're basing this on emotional gut feelings, not actual facts about immigration.
If there was an actual problem you could point out, that's be one thing, but you're just balking because it's a big number.
To me, that's a lot like bitching about public expenditure on infrastructure and things like that, where often the price tag is very high, but not actually wasteful or inflated, but because 300 million dollars is a really big number, it feels in your gut like it's wasteful and couldn't possibly cost that much.
Guess what, you've found a human shortcoming when it comes to very large numbers.
&gt;The problem is that you're basing this on emotional gut feelings, not actual facts about immigration

No I'm basing it off the reasoning they are giving.
&gt;If there was an actual problem you could point out, that's be one thing, but you're just balking because it's a big number.
No didn't you read what I said earlier?
The TFW program is a sham.
&gt;""But also employers who are asking us to allow them to continue to use immigration more and more as a way to meet their growth needs.""
If you think otherwise then we have to just agree to disagree.
Nobody asks why tho.
They just jump to the conclusion you are racist.
Why is supporting the idea that ethnic Canadians are traditionally European Anglos, Franks, or First Nations a bad thing?
Not sure why being against the generational replacement of my own ethnic group that made this country is 'racist'
It is just to delegitimise him.
The TFW program is distinct from regular immigration, and while I agree that wages have stagnated and that's likely a contributing factor for why we "need" immigrants to fill jobs, it's not really an immigration thing so much as a workers' rights issue and possible abuse of our existing system.
That doesn't actually support your position though.
If anything, fixing those problems would allow our immigration to continue working the same way, and would likely reduce the number of people we accept per year naturally without reform aside from stopping those abusive practices by employers.
Seriously?
African-Canadians have been here for centuries, and other groups have lived here for a long time.
You really want to just ignore that Ukrainians, Chinese, and Germans haven't been here since basically the beginning of the modern country?
[deleted]
racism wasn't plan A - "dumb uneducated rednecks" was plan A.
Plan C is probably sexism, although one could argue that's been running in tandem with the racist shtick and will have a short shelf life.
We don't have the infrastructure in our hospitals nor schools to handle hundreds of thousands of extra people a year, for one.
I'd rather the government take action in incentivizing citizens to have more kids instead of just importing people.
I think it's mostly been because of the mouths anti-immigrant sentiment has been coming out of.
It just happens racists most often spout these views - ie Trump in the states.
Or course there are valid arguments for reducing immigration - we just haven't seen them from rational people at this point.
I think as the housing crisis continues we'll eventually see some concessions on immigration.
Though it is a tough argument to make in a country where pretty much everyone is only first, second, or third generation Canadian.
&gt;They’re very mixed, sorry you’re not as pure as you thought.
Never argued for any "purity", no such thing as a pure ethnic group.
But go ahead, keep adding layers to my argument that I never brought up.
[deleted]
Sure they have, and the point is that Canada has been a country dominated by it's Franco-Anglo ethnic groups since it's inception (with other European groups being assimilated into said groups).
Suggesting that I don't want the majority of young child bearing Canadians to be Indian or Chinese by 2050 isn't "racist".
Literally zero hatred against either of those groups comes with said statement.
Wanting Turkey to be Turkish isn't racist, wanting Koreans to be ethnic Koreans til rapture sure isn't, so why is arguing for the survival of my own ethnic homeland racist?
Why is economic benefit better than the survival of my culture?
The types of people you want to have kids would not be the types of people taking advantage of this.
Also, the world as a whole _really_ doesn't need incentivized population growth.
There's too many people here already.
If you don't give people reasons, the only thing they can do is jump to one conclusion or another.
You're a racist.
It is clear.
Because the globalists are pushing islamification of the west.
You're not wrong, but you disingenuously ignore that there is a large overlap between the two.
you realize with immigration population growth is 1% right?
Believing that there are ethnic Canadians like Borden or Laurier isn't racism, and neither is saying that Kai-Shek was Chinese, and only Sinitic people like him can be Chinese.
You're very wrong.
Thats just your filtered look on it.
"Dumb uneducated rednecks" was the left's plan A for manipulating public opinion?
Tell us, how does one implement such a plan?
You see this is totally fine.
notice how nobody is calling you a racist?
I'd argue that you are wrong but i'm not going to get into it right now.
Surely you can see the difference between your argument and the drivel that gets regularly brought up.
Is berniers position even anti immigration i assume he is pro immigration since he is libertarian.
The typical conversations usually don’t allow for that.
It usually ends in name calling and dismissing the person before they can explain their position.
I’m pro legal immigration but I find myself in these conversations often and I see the way these talks go.
There’s a lot of dismissiveness on the progressive/left.
They almost always result to name calling, yelling and not listening.
I do find a lot of people these days don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to react to what someone else says.
&gt; More people, leading to more economic growth means more tax revenue to invest in infrastructure and affordable housing.
More people also means a tax drain.
People require services - healthcare, police, schooling, roads, infrastructure, etc., it is not a one-way street.

Being Libertarian doesn't mean open borders and letting your country be over-run by non-libertarians.
&gt;Because the globalists are pushing islamification of the west.
lol.
Certainly is more libertarian than using government intervention to block people from entry by some arbitrary factor.
Or we could try to improve birthrates here.
Subsidising childcare, as well as fighting against the current social engineering.
You have GOT to be kidding.
Controlling your borders is somehow fascist now?
Just go away.
I'm done here.
Lol, not fascist just not libertarian.
How could you block access without violating non aggression?
What happens when all the robots take our jobs like I'm always hearing about?
Do we keep bringing in 300 000 new people for all those jobs we don't need to work?
Hmm, it's odd how you frame it as advocating for a "more white" nation.
Instead, they seem to frame it as a "same level" kind of thing, generally.
Tell me, do you think Japan should be forced to become more diverse?
How about Kenya?
Nigeria?
[deleted]
So, Japan, Kenya, and Nigeria are not at all diverse, and you're unwilling to say that they should become more diverse, yet Canada should be?
Ridiculous double standards.
I can't go to China and buy property.
Yet, you want to open up the doors for people to come here to out compete local citizens.
Your claims of racism fall flat, and have destroyed the word.
And you can claim i'm just parroting racist talking points, but I have lived my entire life with the knowledge that half of my family was executed in gas chambers.
Nothing is wrong, at all, with desiring strong national borders, limited immigration, and being proud of your ethnicity.
What's wrong is genocide, and, to a lesser extent, advocating destroying the fabric of the society that afforded you such a life.
[deleted]
Every single country in the world required some level of immigration at some point in their history to get to where they are today.
This does not mean that historical trends must be continued.
This is a fallacy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy.
Things change, right?
I doubt you'd advocate going back to the days of the immigration that created Canada, it was brutal.
So why use it in an argument?
Would you say that the immigration of the past lead to disaster to the original inhabitants of the land, the aboriginals?
I bet you would.
So why are you advocating for the same process in today's world, when the same thing can easily happen, more disaster for regular Canadian citizens, and even more disaster to the aboriginal populations, which are not thriving in our current society.
And please don't say that someone with *my family history* should feel a certain way, this is actual racism, as you're enforcing your stereotypical ethnic bias upon me.
I don't think that's a well enough studied topic to actually determine.
Especially as being "racist" seems to have degrees.
You're missing the point entirely.
The conversation never gets started because the far left shuts down that conversation before it even gets started.
If the last 2-3 years of activist protests didn't show you the absolute shit tier state of modern liberalism and their unwillingness to have even the most basic conversation with people they "might" disagree with then I think you're intentionally ignoring how bad the left has become with civil discourse.
The left also conflates "legal" and "illegal" immigration all the time.
Always refusing to talk about why we need to do more to stop illegal immigration and even perhaps slow down legal immigration.
The left always refuses to acknowledge that their obsession with identity politics is only teaching the extreme right that that's how they need to play the game if they want to win.
Combine that with not even listening to even the most moderate right wing speakers and you end up pushing those moderates further from the left and the center at the same time.
Radicalization begets more radicalization.
The rise of the alt right is the great moral panic of our time.
They exist and they suck but the far left is a much, much bigger concern.
Specifically related to shutting down conversation and the sheer amount of control they actually have over our society &lt;Media, Universities, Government, etc&gt;

If you want to curtail "all these racists" stop playing identity politics and moderate lefties, reign in your crazy activists.
They're pushing people away from your movement in droves.
Edit: Changed "right" to "rise"
We already do incentivize it.
The Child Benefit is pretty generous, and Quebec at least provides cheap daycare.
I don't think any developed nation has succeeded in reversing the trend.
Low birth rate seems to be strongly linked to education and access to birth control.
So you've been cowed by the tactics of the left to smear anybody who doesn't agree with them.
Congrats on being their stooge.
On a net basis, economic immigrants, who comprise the majority, contribute quite a lot more to the economy (an a bit more in taxes) than they take in social benefits.
Mincome, hopefully.
The unemployed people can create art and literature or whatever, paid for by the huge productivity gains brought by the robots.
At some point, bringing large numbers of immigrants may not make sense, but we are a long way from that point.
An immigration based economy is stagnant and unsustainable.
Within a century global populations will stabilize and just bringing people in from the third world won't work.
Immigrants and TFW also are more willing to work for less stagnating wages.
Finally they congregate in urban centers disproportionately compared to native born Canadians driving up housing prices in those areas.
A better system would be to engage in pro-reproduction public policy and cut back on immigration to a rate equal to the missing difference between gains/losses the previous years, plus a few extras for "reunifications" plus refugees.
Eventually we can reduce immigration to a much lower number but continue to maintain a small stream of well trained professionals, like engineers and doctors.
But is their GDP/capita the same as native-born Canadians, if not we are inflating our GDP at the expense of our GDPC which is the most important number of Canadians.
That was the first thing they used to discredit their opponents, they called them dumb uneducated rednecks.
Now they use racist/sexist as their "I WIN" button because agreeing with a racist, like a dumb uneducated redneck, is HORRIBLE and would make you a bad person.
But improving birth rates isn’t a good thing either.
“Fighting against the current social engineering” is nonsense, people’s mindsets change over time.
Every developed country has low birth rates.
The best thing, for both the planet, and the society, is to let immigration play out.
We need to work on improving screening and assimilation too of course.
&gt; We're arguably more similar to them.
Yea I'd definitely disagree with that.
We're also largely insulated from British fuck ups, so most people don't pay attention to British issues.
Really, now?
People are calling David Suzuki a racist, are they?
We don't pay attention because it doesn't give us any sense of pride for doing things different than them.
Our patriotic feelings come from being different than Americans.
Do you think the Americans or the British pay attention to anyone but themselves?
Of course not.
Because their source of patriotic pride comes from within their borders.
Although, I would argue Britain today has a problem with patriotism as their social class politics have gotten out of hand as of late.
It seems to be all focused in either Vancouver or Toronto tho it’s not being evenly distributed around the country.
You literally cannot force someone to stay somewhere as per the charters of rights and freedoms.
6.
(1) Every citizen of Canada has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada.
(2) Every citizen of Canada and every person who has the status of a permanent resident of Canada has the right

a) to move to and take up residence in any province; and
b) to pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province.
Once they are PR they can go anywhere they want.
I’m aware, it’s just making the city’s too expensive for anyone to live in is all.
Experience has show most people that when asked why some people are against immigration, they will say that they don't want more of "them people" bringing in "their culture".
When the statement is, "I'm for reducing immigration", the response shouldn't be "OMGZ THAT'S FUCKING RACIST!".
Which 9 time out of 10 is essentially what you get, why would anyone choose to engage in a conversation after that?
It's not misinterpreting when someone doesn't even inquire as to why, they just default to a set level of outrage and accusations.
When you assume everyone's a racist, perhaps you're projecting too much.
So all the illegals can live with you then.
And you can pay for all their shit out of your own pocket.
If you don't agree with that then you're a racist.
If I would give or sell something to a citizen, then I'd give or sell it to the undocumented migrants as well.
Simple policy.

I understand how and why people from central and south america come to work on farms but i dont understand these fast food places.
Fixing our natal situation is a hard pill to swallow, but it is better than complete ethnic replacement with zero foresight into the future, it's a short term solution with no good long term benefits.
A majority Indian Canada isn't going to worship the Fathers of Confederation, nor will they find connection with our old Red Ensign &amp; our sacrifices in war.
Instead, they will have their own non-European cultural heritage, and will have vastly different cultural values.
Canada is going to become "Canada" in name, because apparently the most important thing is that we put capitalism over the security of what *actually* makes Canada; Canada.

&gt; Anti-immigration is a completely valid political view

Not really, no.
It's not based on rational thought, but on purely irrational fears.
&gt;A person can be against more immigration.
That's not what being "anti-immigration" is.
&gt;But now in this overly PC western culture, somehow if you aren't PRO immigration, you are a racist.
That's because most people who are anti-immigration are, in fact, racists.
It's not going to work.
People have less kids when standards of living improve.
You can't force people to have kids, thus immigration is the only viable solution.
Great arguments.
Eyeroll..
That's straight up misinformation.
The planet can handle a lot more people.
What we have on this planet is a resource distribution problem.
I’d like to see statistics that support that.
I don’t deny there’s lots of people like this but I believe there are lots who just believe our economy is struggling to support what we have and would rather see it fixed than bringing more in.
Supporting Our homeless, veterans, fixing poverty etc.
I’m not backing this answer but it’s the common one I see.
&gt;  I believe there are lots who just believe our economy is struggling to support what we have

I would like to see factual numbers that support this.
Like I said.
This isn’t my excuse, this is what I hear.
So don’t ask me to back it up.
It is not just the charter of rights that is the only obstacle here.
If it was desirable living they would do it themsleves.
How far off the US border do you live?
I am making it a point of asking people how far off the US border they live when I see this come up, just to see.
When the stat is 90% of the population lives 100 km of that border there is a REASON.
Much like north China or greater Russia.
China is a neat example because there climate is not covered in perma like ours.
Yet you can see the land per populations has an ever increasing disparity the further north one looks.

I am concerned that Canada has not put very much thought into the affects of "more people cause the ecconomy" approach.
It tells me that we really have no plan other than adding people for GDP.
One would think there would need to be a hard plan on medical, school, intergration, WASTE MANAGMENT, land mangagment, job allocation, ect, for this to work.
We have a finite set of resources and smashing more people in does not make it more flexible, it actually makes it worse.

The human race appears to have thrown out logic for feelings to a degree; example: it is not a right to have more than 2 kids, it is actually a privilege in the sense that this planet, when exhaust, will kill off everyone.
It is pragmatic but accurate.
Not all directed at you, I didn't want to track down the 1000 post in here that are common to political topics of this nature.
&gt; The planet can handle a lot more people.
What we have on this planet is a resource distribution problem.
I hear this all the time, but that's really just deferring to a future solution we may not ever be able to come up with.
The fact of the matter is that we have too many people on this planet for what we can realistically achieve right now.
If we figure out resource management in the future and can sustain more people without destroying the planet, then great.
But that's not the case today.
We are coming up with those solutions now, GMO crops, Lab grown meat, Vertical farming, learning more about nutrition and so on.
"he fact of the matter is that we have too many people on this planet for what we can realistically achieve right now. "
Also untrue.
We simply do not have the will.
Some will have to give up things for everyone to have enough, and that's a big challenge.
Later on this could likely be achieved without one side giving up stuff.
You can argue that's the same thing but I don't feel it is.
Great rebuttal.
Eyeroll...
What arguments?

Summary: 
I value immigration restrictions not at all.
I can see where you're getting at.
That's not what being "anti-immigration" is.
I am pro-gun and anti-illegal immigration.
That's because most people who are anti-immigration are, in fact, racists.
A person can be against *more* immigration.
&gt;A person can be against more immigration.
I too think that there needs to be some way to screen immigrants.
This is the primary reason we need immigration.
If you don't agree with that then you're a racist.
The planet can handle a lot more people.
You can see after a while why people would correlate those things.
People will make assumptions about you based on things you say.
I blame the racists for poisoning the conversation.
People are calling David Suzuki a racist, are they?
There's too many people here already.
&gt;This is the primary reason we need immigration.
You can argue that's the same thing but I don't feel it is.
&gt; This is the primary reason we need immigration.
It's not going to work.
&gt; The planet can handle a lot more people.
If other people misinterperet you it's possibly because more specifics are needed.
That's why Canadians choose to not do things the American way.
I call that traitorous behavior.
you realize with immigration population growth is 1% right?
These two reason I disagree with.
It is just to delegitimise him.
Mind sharing your qualms with immigration then?
The problem is so much deeper than this.
Things like the TFW program, though...
That's why people who are against immigration need to be more specific about what they are against and not just say they are anti-immigration because people paint broad strokes.
People have less kids when standards of living improve.
I think it's mostly been because of the mouths anti-immigrant sentiment has been coming out of.
The left also conflates "legal" and "illegal" immigration all the time.
Especially as being "racist" seems to have degrees.
It tells me that we really have no plan other than adding people for GDP.
It's not about saying what they aren't for but saying what they actually are for.
Usually it's the right that argues for it, not always.
Anti immigration is a euphemism for “we only want white people here”.
If you don't give people reasons, the only thing they can do is jump to one conclusion or another.
This isn’t my excuse, this is what I hear.
notice how nobody is calling you a racist?
Experience has show most people that when asked why some people are against immigration, they will say that they don't want more of "them people" bringing in "their culture".
More people also means a tax drain.
And he/she may be a racist.
They just jump to the conclusion you are racist.
The number is open for debate.
I’d like to see statistics that support that.
The best thing, for both the planet, and the society, is to let immigration play out.
I am making it a point of asking people how far off the US border they live when I see this come up, just to see.
The problem is that you're basing this on emotional gut feelings, not actual facts about immigration.
So why use it in an argument?
Did I say I didnt blame corporations?
This resonates a lot with the people who get their sense of patriotism from being different from Americans.
I think as the housing crisis continues we'll eventually see some concessions on immigration.
