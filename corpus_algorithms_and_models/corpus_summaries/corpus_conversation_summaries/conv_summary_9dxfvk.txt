Original Response: 
I think the voopootech rep commented on the last exploded drag saying something about juice getting into the chip thru the 510.
I’ll try and find the post but it may take a bit.
I’ve been taking my tank off every night &amp; q-tipping the connection just to be safe.
EDIT:
“We are paying high attention to these cases, mostly those meltdown situations caused by the leaking juice sinking into the chip inside from the 510 connectors.”.
Its why I clean my 510 every now and then and before every coil change.
I'm actually really scared about this now as my HorizonTech Falcon leaks all the damn time on the bottom.
Yeah I bought the drag thinking it would be an ultra reliable daily driver &amp; am having second thoughts now.
I have the falcon as well &amp; mine rarely leaks.
Make sure when you screw on the top cap it’s 100% flush.
Some people have had leaking issues because the threads weren’t lined up.
Well, this is one way to find out who conformal coats their boards and who doesn’t...
Which shouldn't have ever been an issue.
If you're making a device that's going to have a big tank of liquid sitting on top of it, you should make the circuitry water proof.
Same here, i have a drag as my daily mod and I just yesterday found lots of juice in the battery area I clear it all out but I’m almost certain it came from the 510 connection.
Yep it’s happening to me now.
Just noticed some juice leaking out of the crack between the top plate and the Just Drag lettering.
It could’ve slipped in through the battery door but I highly doubt it as no juice ever runs down the side of my mod or tank.
It is only ever wet on the bottom of the tank, right where the 510 is.
Literally bought this mod because I was tired of juice leaking into my old moonbox &amp; all the reviews I’d seen said the drag was sturdy and reliable with no major issues.
rip hope I can get a year out of it.
Would it be horrible to take it apart and coat the circuitry if you already have a voopoo device?
Thanks for the qtip tip I just picked a drag up and saw this post as well.
Stay safe!
My battery strap was soaked.. can’t be good.
I wonder if they would end up recalling before they start getting lawsuits.

No, but you have to take it apart and conformal coat it, which should already be done by any manufacturer with a liquid-pcb usage case.
