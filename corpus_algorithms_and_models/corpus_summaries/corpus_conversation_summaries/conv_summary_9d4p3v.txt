Original Response: 
X-post from re/sex.
Looking for advice on whether I mis-handled this situation and if so, how I can handle it better in the future.
Backstory: I (27f) have been dating my bf (28) for 5 years.
Tonight while eating dinner and watching a movie, he came home tipsy and during one scene in the movie goes "oh, sexy women...." to which I jokingly replied "Sorry?"
He responded "I just miss sexy women in my life."
I asked him to elaborate and he said "I've just been seeing a lot of Asian supermodels at my work lately, and like, I love you but am I everything you want sexually?"
I said that's not a very nice thing to say to someone while they're watching Netflix and he followed with "I don't mean to be offensive, it's just like, I've seen Asians, Croatians, Brazilians...I'm just being honest."
I looked pretty pissed and he ended with "I didn't meant to offend you so easily."
Basically, I found it super rude to casually bring when your SO is in sweatpants eating dinner, but if he has more to say I want him to feel comfortable saying it.
So, Question #1 was I wrong to be offended in the moment?
Question #2 How do I bring the convo up after basically shutting it down in the moment?
**Tl;dr - Boyfriend casually brought up all the hot women he's been seeing at his work and how he misses "sexy women."
Not sure if I reacted the right way, or how to bring the topic up again.

Oh my god, why bother?
What an asshole.
If he wants to go try to get with hot Asian, Croatian, and Brazilian women (who I'm sure would be thrilled to be lumped into categories and totally objectified) you should encourage him to do so.
Right now he's treating you like his auxiliary backup vagina- go find someone who actually respects you as a person.

Happy cake day, and yeah this comment pretty much sums it up.
The request itself is already quite much, the justification takes it way too far.
You deserve better.

Or discuss the possibility of opening things up....
"Foreign" is just another creepy way to say "exotic"

The bf is a creep and I'm willing to bet you are too.
Not to mention, as an Asian American, if anyone ever called me “foreign” or “exotic”, I would be 200% turned off.
I’ve had a couple different people call me exotic after meeting me... every time I’m like you realize I was born in the same damn city as you right?
This 100%.
Women aren't like porn, he can't sort by race/ethnicity and try each one out at his leisure like they're novelties, then go back to OP when hes done.
Fuck this dude.
I hope these models hes so infatuated with see through his bullshit too.

Drunk guy said *to his girlfriend* that he “misses sexy women” (implying that she is not one) and talks about all the models he objectifies and fetishizes by their ethnicities, while directly implying that she’s not enough for him sexually?
You’d be cool with just ignoring comments like these?
I hope you have more respect for yourself than that.

But you were born in southside, so exotic.

I see this scenario a LOT on this sub.
One partner has bad FOMO and wants to sleep around.
Like sex and relationships are a candy shop, you can come and try flavors until you’re satisfied.
Not really how it works.

Let's not minimalize his actions.
That's not what happened.
He objectified women in a racist way and deliberately went out of his way to make his gf seem unloved and expendable.

Oh my god, that was a clusterfuck.
And then there were a few of us who were trying to point out that "of course he's going to be hurt by that, he's been getting this for as long as the resemblance existed and he thought you were someone who saw him as HIM and not a Winter Soldier expy but now he knows you aren't that person" and we got shouted down hard.
Do you have the link?
Yeah, I'm korean and have been told "I only like Asians" "koreans are the sexiest" and other things like that like they're compliments.
Like the only thing about me that is worth anything is that I'm asian.
More than the whole wanting to sleep with other people thing, I'd be more concerned with how he views women as objects.
The post is gone, but the objectification remains.
