Original Response: 
I recently moved back to corpus and thought I would try Uber and Lyft to make some extra money with my free time.
I did rideshare in Austin for a while but I was wondering what it's like here in corpus.
Is there a high demand for rideshare here?
If so when are the busiest times?
Or if there is another rideshare app worth considering.Thanks for any replies.
The only riseshare I believe is allowed in corpus is TRide and never tried them.
Uber and lyft seem to have angered the city / taxi companies here.
Actually Uber came back just last month I believe.
It did.
My mom works for both.
The can make some decent money on the weekends.
She's only doing it part time till she finds work.
She's worked also for regular cab companies.
I'll ask her later and report back.
Thank you.
