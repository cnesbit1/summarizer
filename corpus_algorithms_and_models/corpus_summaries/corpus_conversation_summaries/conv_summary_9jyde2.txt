You should see the NASA sat loop of the winter, spring, summer, fall cycle of vegetation dying then growing but instead you see the Co2 levels dramatically rise and by mid summer you se O2 levels dramatically rise.
Pretty awesome satellite loop.
Edit: I’ve posted the link three times but I had somebody PM they are not showing up, the links.

Can you all see this???
Edit: now I can see the messages people are posting pop up on my phone but as soon as I tap to see they are gone.
Something is going on.
Have a link?
This is the moment in your life when you ask yourself.
Should I link that?
