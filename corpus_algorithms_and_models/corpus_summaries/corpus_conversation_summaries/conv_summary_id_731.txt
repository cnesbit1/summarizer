I'm not trying to start a war, I'm on mobile so maybe this is covered in the sidebar if so I apologize... *Is* a hotdog a sandwich?
&gt;  I'm sure there are great pics of your favorite celebrities eating salads and ice cream and pizza.
This sub is about famous people eating sandwiches.
(We're counting hamburgers, hot dogs and wraps as part of the sandwich family; seriously, let's not make a federal case out of this rule.
)Thats the sidebar.. :) Yes a hot dog is (was) considered a sandwich..
But I think it was just ruled by [The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hot-dogs-are-not-sandwiches_564212a2e4b0b24aee4bd3f3)  that it is not a sandwich..   Sooooo... We might have to have a mod meeting about this.
Cool.
Thanks.
