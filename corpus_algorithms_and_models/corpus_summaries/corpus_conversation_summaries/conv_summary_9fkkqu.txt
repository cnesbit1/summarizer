*[Laughs in Saskatchewan]*
Appreciate the translation!
Some of us don't speak Saskatchewan.
Guess what... if Ford gets away with it here in Ontario, how long do you think it will be until other people start trying it?
The door will be opened and if it’s not shut down quickly, there will be no way to stop it.
Why?
Because *nothing ever happens in Saskatchewan* and its fun to watch the garbage fire from afar.
Ha!
Fair enough.
Don't laugh too hard, you guys are the next to go to crazy town.
So you got Ontario and the US what about Alberta or BC and NWT?
Nope, Alberta is next.
:/

I'm glad that in Quebec we don't have those nutjobs in major parties.
Sure, they are far from perfect but still way better than this.
Yeah although you guys already used the nonwithstanding clause.

I'm from BC - that's a *literal fire*
Only the 1?
Did they all merge?
Quebec has its fair share of crazy town.
It is a toss up.
Thats because you guys  are generally more engaged and get pissed off (and protest) way faster.
Look at when they wanted to raise tuition by a few bucks...
Psssh.
Anyone from rural Saskatchewan knows that burning garbage in the backyard is a fun pastime.
Go ahead and laugh.
Wait till it happens to you, you stunned arsehole.
Losing democratic rights is no laughing matter.
Fool.
Yes.
The entire province is on fire.
I think the person you're responding to was just having a little fun, i think your response is unwarranted.
Alberta already went full crazy town.
"Few bucks"
Perhaps.
But I take Democracy seriously.
Recent history teaches us how easy it is to lose it, and that is no laughing matter.

Saskatchewan already did it.
We used s33 to restore funding to Catholic schools after the court told the province it shouldn't fund Catholic schools that were predominantly full of non-Catholic students.
tl;dr A public school was shut down due to lack of students to save money, local Catholic school division re-opens the school and demands funding, public division sued to stop the money because closing the school to save money was the whole point.
Judge decides Catholic schools full of non-Catholics shouldn't count as Catholic separate schools.
I just finished Yascha Mounk’s “The People vs. Democracy” and it scared the shit out of me.
I hear you, am right there with you.
Fair enough.
'K.✌.
Tax money to fund private catholic schools  
*Quite the scandal*
Here's a map from BC services.

It's like a screenshot from those hexagonal war games.
Has it slowed down at all?
a big cold front has hit us in the west, with rain...or snow...
The state of emergency ended at least.
But it's still fire season all around.

Summary: 
I hear you, am right there with you.
The entire province is on fire.
