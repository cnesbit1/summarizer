Original Response: 
I am about to take my test there, and I was wondering if I could find the route so I could scope it out ahead of time.
Is there somewhere where it is online?
Is this even legal?
To the best of my knowledge, there is no "official" route.
The driver tells you to turn down different roads, get on the highway here, off over here, left, right, practice parking, etc.
At least, that's how it was when I took it, but that was a lot of years ago.
Alright.
I know that in AP they have one route they follow, but it might not be the same in Corpus.
Unless you're a really, really bad driver, you shouldn't worry.
The traffic in that area isn't bad, so the test is easy af.
Same for me when I did it, too.
