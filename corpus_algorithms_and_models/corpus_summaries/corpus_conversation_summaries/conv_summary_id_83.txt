Anyone know of a good one?
Gotten burned from some of the mobile guys around here.
Like knife and shear sharpening?
This will definitely not help at all, but there's a mobile guy.
A little eccentric (wear clips in his hair and such) that does different routes throughout the week, he mostly works salons and does shears.
He's super affordable and great.
for dog grooming, yeah, got a number?
I can get it in the morning and shoot it to you.
I've been looking for someone to sharpen our kitchen knives for a couple of years, and can't find anyone locally.

I used him when I ran kitchens.
Always did a good job and fair prices.
Nah, I tried that guy, he ruined about $1000 worth of tools, wouldn't return our calls and his prices changed on a whim.
