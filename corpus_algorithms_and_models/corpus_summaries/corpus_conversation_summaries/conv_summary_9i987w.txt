Original Response: 
Such a shame that Renault didn't decide to keep her around, I was looking forward to the day where she'd get some track time.I'm sure her....less than stellar junior career was the product of a series of unfortunate and unavoidable cases of bad luck.
^^^/s.......plus those denim shorts she was rocking in Hungary.ZZ Top said it best I think:&gt;She's got legs, she knows how to use them.
Renault did keep her for this season as a development driver.
And he's she has lovely legs...
Really?I thought it her going was mentioned around the same time as the buyout becoming official.Not complaining though!
