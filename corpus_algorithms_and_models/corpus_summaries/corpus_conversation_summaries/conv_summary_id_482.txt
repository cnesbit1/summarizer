I want to go on a date with just her and also go to somewhere nice with all of them.
Help me with ideas please reddit!

Executive Surf Club is great for all of you to go together.
The T-heads downtown, next to McGee Beach.
Its fun to walk around and try the vendor food.
They also have bikes to rent that seat either 3 or 4 people.
There's the obvious Lexington and aquarium, though I have never been to either.
I work at the Aquarium.
It's pretty neat.
It's expensive, though.
But it's very nice.
I just found out about that place while boarding around downtown!
I will definitely go there!
T-heads?
vendor food?
is this like off the pier?
Down at the bayfront, somewhat next to the piers.
They don't always have vendor food, but they do sometimes.
If they do, i recommend Uncle Ray's hotdogs.
All this is in front of the Bank of America.

Summary: 
I will definitely go there!
