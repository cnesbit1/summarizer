Original Response: 
Christianity argues that salvation is necessary to avoid eternal damnation, and that "sharing the Gospel" is an act of love because it is warning a person of danger, or a being like a beggar telling another beggar where to get free bread.
However, since the danger is created by the same entity that is offering a way to avoid the danger, and that entity is demanding payment in the form of worship and belief, this makes the offer more akin to extortion by threat of violence than a loving warning about danger.
God created hell, God created the rules that say you will be tortured in hell for all eternity without even the release of death, God created the tortures, and God created way to avoid this fate which requires payment in the form of belief and worship.
There is no possible way to look rationally at that setup and see it as kind, loving, or anything but a means of extorting belief and prayer from people.

Christianity is not essentially different from a mob protection racket.
God wants you to pay him with prayer and belief, and if you fail to do so he will cause you harm.
The Gospel is not good news, it's a threat, and it's extortion.
Threatening a person, even on behalf of someone else, cannot be considered kind or loving and Christians cannot reasonably expect non-Christians to see their efforts to proselytize as anything but a threat.

Summary: 
The Gospel is not good news, it's a threat, and it's extortion.
