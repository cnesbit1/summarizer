No, that's not the address.
What I got when scanning it: KzPvQE7xnRbFw8VnU6cyoYnXNbd8tRNHuTKa1bpnspz9Xtot4aFS

Which looked like a private key to me, so I got the public key of that which is: 1BgGZ9tcN4rm9KBzDn7KprQz87SZ26SAMH.
Nope, the address was https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/17CNy6h74cpQDfubYD1tizm5DgoPyezmto.
weird, try scanning it from the image you posted.
185VJnon7wxgCkRv2bbfZzWkktGz5xnbWt is the uncompressed Adress and 17CNy6h74cpQDfubYD1tizm5DgoPyezmto is the compressed.
Compressed should be used my most wallets today.
You might want to double check your software, maybe you have an address substitution virus.
The possible addresses for that wallet are:

P2PKH:  17CNy6h74cpQDfubYD1tizm5DgoPyezmto

P2SH-P2WPKH: 3H7Ro8PRefNcvFZbsBt2CFkC8qq6mxK8Nn

P2WPKH: bc1qg0m64ek643xymd9qsgts2ekttr3khc0awpvc55.
Maybe compressed / uncompressed pubkey.
&gt; maybe you have an address substitution virus.
Looking at the transactions of that address, that seems highly likely.
Check the transactions of the address you got.
/u/cm9kZW8K probably has the right idea - your computer is likely compromised.
You got incredibly lucky to learn it this way!
Edit: See below, could just be a bug in the address decoder.
I guess not, Even I scanned the same address.
I got the same thing scanning the QR code with my phone camera and viewing the raw content.
Can someone explain what's going on?
Okay, the private key is indeed correct, but the public address /u/bringeroflefaceface calculated is incorrect.
I used https://brainwalletx.github.io/#generator to calculate it.

I think I may have solved the riddle: Incorrect key decoding.
https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1702503.0 says the address corresponds to a private key of "1".
The "Bitcoin Manual Mining Helper" stuff visible in the tx history for the address is probably just spam.
[blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info) has switched to .com?
How odd...
Cool that they want to let a bitcoiner into their space and give a talk; I figured most wouldn't want a guy who is into the the tech that is set out to ruin their archaic, ruinous business model anywhere near them.
That's what they loaded your speaking fee on to?

Summary: 
No, that's not the address.
Check the transactions of the address you got.
