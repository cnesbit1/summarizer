Original Response: 
Never been in a hurricane before.
Im in dallas but my apartment is pretty close to oso bay.
Should i make the 12 hour drive to flood proof the apartment?
If you've got insurance, no.
If you don't have insurance, probably still no.
They're expecting landfall around Friday evening, by then you could get stuck in place.
Don't risk your life for stuff.
there is no flood proofing.
If it gets that bad everything is gone anyway.
Moving expensive stuff higher up, grabbing electronics etc.
I have to ask, did you go?
Yeah but the water pump in my car blew out halfway there so i didnt make it :P  not a good day.
Well be glad your water pump blew half way there, instead of when you got there.
if your apartment is on the first floor, expect a total loss, but be pleasantly surprised if it isn't.
Thanks :P.
Hopefully you've got insurance.
If you are young, you can always buy or create new stuff.
I pulled the hard drive from my computer but otherwise ignored all my electronics.
Hopefully you're not at waters edge apartments, those will flood on the bottom floor for sure.

Summary: 
there is no flood proofing.
If you've got insurance, no.
