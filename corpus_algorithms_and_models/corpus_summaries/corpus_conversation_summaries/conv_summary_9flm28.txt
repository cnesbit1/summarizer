Original Response: 
So my friend (we can call her Claire) met this wolf-girl (we can call her Lily) freshman year when she was forced to move schools.
Lily told her she was a werewolf Claire just went along with it because, hey, this was the only person who would talk to her.
Lily is really a terrible person (into bestiality and such), so Claire just messes with her on the whole werewolf thing.
The picture of the pawprints she took was actually outside of a Taco Bell.
How did you guys find out shes into beastiality?
Did she tell you or something?
Claire walked in on Lily's dog licking her, lol.
Wat.

Name checks out.
I think that's illegal?
Maybe you guys should tell someone.
it is illegal in my state, but there's not really anything we can do about it.
Your name indicates something else lmao.
Dude.
Call the police.
And do... what?
it's not like I have any evidence.
The only person who knows she's into that is my friend.
I'm pretty sure its only illegal if a person has intercourse with an animal, but i'm not really sure how it is in America.
But thats so damn messed up.
This doesn't even seem like a phase, maybe you guys should try to talk to her about it, explain why its wrong.

Summary: 
it's not like I have any evidence.
Maybe you guys should tell someone.
Did she tell you or something?
The only person who knows she's into that is my friend.
