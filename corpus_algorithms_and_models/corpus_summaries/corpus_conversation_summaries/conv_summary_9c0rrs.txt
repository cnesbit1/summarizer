Original Response: 
This is like asking for Benedict Arnold's opinion on loyalty.
...why?
My only guess is that Tate changed camps like 3 or 4 times during her MMA stint, but it's not like she never had any ups or downs during her career, also, she was never really at a major camp, outside of I think Xtreme Couture, which is difficult to call a major camp these days, outside of simply being located in Vegas and having a lot of fighters simply dropping in.
Tate has had a weird career, simply b/c she was more or less a pioneer.
I was more hinting at the fact she was talking about loyalty but just months after breaking up with her long time bf she has a baby with another dude from the same gym.
It probably wasn't the best of jokes anyways.
Bryan and her had been split for over a year before the pregnancy.
Some people donâ€™t need to wallow in self pity for six months after a breakup to move on.
Just how long would you have suggested Miesha waited before dating someone else that you would consider it not an act of disloyalty?
not a single mention of her banging cowboy while still with Bryan?
Got any proof of that?

All the proof we need then.
I won't believe it until I see the whatsapp screenshot.
