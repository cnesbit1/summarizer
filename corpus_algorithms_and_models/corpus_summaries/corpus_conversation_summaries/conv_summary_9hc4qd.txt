Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario.
If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request.
We'll probably grant it.

New episodes of Serial out today.
Which is amazing!
What're your favourite non-MMA podcasts?
JRE MMA Show.
All kidding aside, probably Cumtown and The Game Of Thrones Podcast with Preston Jacobs.
I've been craving a good self-improvement podcast, one that incorporates fitness, psychology, business/financial advice, people skills, etc... Is Art Of Charm any good?
Jordan Harbinger Show?
Art Of Manliness?
Mind Pump?
Barbell Shrugged?
JRE.
I haven't listened to any of those, but Tim Ferriss has a very popular podcast that incorporates all those things.
He interviews successfully people precisely in an effort to suss out their fitness, psychology, business/financial, social, nutrition, sleep, etc... routines.
Grading by the median episode, I think it's a pretty terrible show, but I listen a few times a year when he gets a guest I'm particularly interested in or if an episode gets particular hype.
Off the top of my head, as a runner, I enjoyed an episode he did with a guy from Nike, his Jamie Foxx episodes are very famous and good, I liked the one with Terry Crews too, and he had Malcolm Gladwell on who is a perennial great pod guest on whatever shows he's on.
Bill Burr's Monday Morning Podcast.
WeHateMovies is good.
The Football Rambles great if you follow the Premier League.
Bill Simmons, The Nine Club, How Did This Get Made, Slow Burn, Binge mode, and a few Thrones pods when that’s going.
I was shocked by how great Slow Burn is.
I didn't listen to the first season, people recommended it and I initially didn't listen.
Then I tried it on a roadtrip and was very impressed by how well done it is and how much information in there I didn't know.
Same is happening now with season 2.
Yeah, that show really illustrates the idea of history repeating itself.
Tons of info, but presented in a way that’s not an overload.
Jocko Willinks podcast is pretty good.
The Last Podcast on the Left, is a fun and super interesting podcast on serial killers, the occult, aliens, and just high strangeness stuff.
[deleted]
Depends what your poison is, I got introduced to them in the Aum Shinrikio (episodes 218-221) because cults fascinate me.
The latest one on the Donner party was pretty damn interesting too, the Jeffrey Dahmer ones are a good start if Serial Killers are more your flavor.
What's your favourite Game Of Thrones podcast?
I love Preston's but I want more theories to tide me over until the next book comes out in 2024.
Thanks, babe.
History of Westeros and Storm of Spoilers are my 2 favorite if you’re a book reader.

Summary: 
Jocko Willinks podcast is pretty good.
I was shocked by how great Slow Burn is.
