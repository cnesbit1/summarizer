One of the articles covering this (can't find it and it's late) states that the magazine (I believe it's the New Yorker) "helped the accuser to remember clearly" what happened...I believe it also says it took six days for them to help her remember.
Now this is starting to sound like a conspiracy.
On top of that, Avenatti, none other than Stormy Daniels lawyer is representing the new accuser.
Maybe this is why it was taking Ford so long to respond about testifying?
Maybe they were "waiting for the magazine to help the accuser remember the events clearly"...in other words...waiting until they had everyone's stories straight, including the witnesses willing to back up the new accuser?
Why Avenatti?
Simple...High profile and already embedded in the MSM.
Why do I think Ginsburg will announce her retirement?
Because of a statement she made recently regarding the Kavanaugh nomination and the politicizing of the process.
I also think this is going to have a serious impact on the midterms.
I think it's going to motivate conservatives to vote.
Also of note, this story is going to rule the news cycle this week.
Perfect time for the deep state to take advantage of the distraction and pull some shenanigans somewhere else.
Keep your eyes open.
Michael Avenatti tweeeted that his new client is not Deborah Ramirez which is the woman you are referring to.
His new client is another woman that has made an accusation against Kavanaugh.
Yeah there are 3.
Not looking like a good week for Kavanaugh.
With zero evidence other than their word, seems it'll be just fine.
Accusations are not proof of anything.
They‚Äôre proof an investigation is needed.
If he‚Äôs innocent, what‚Äôs the harm?
A simple allegation?
There's no proof he did it.
Meanwhile, there's a lot of proof he's innocent.
The very witnesses she claims was there have ALL come forth to say she's lying or mistaken.
Dems are using dirty tactics to stall his nomination until after midterms.
These people disgust me.
Ronan Farrow: ‚Äúit is not accurate to say that those who knew [Kavanaugh] at the time dispute" that the allegation is credible‚Äù 

Until the hearing or an investigation, there‚Äôs no basis to claim this is a smear other than your feelings being hurt.
The very witnesses she claims was there have ALL come forth to say she's lying or mistaken.
Explain this.
Source?
seriously?
How can you not know this

I'm not going to waste time digging up more, you can do that yourself.
Sure, Judge also refuses to testify and Farrow has witnesses supporting Ramirez.
All of this could be cleared up by an investigation, yet Republicans don‚Äôt want one.
If he‚Äôs innocent, why not?
Judge does not refuse to testify.
Either you're wrong or you're flat our lying.
You don't open an investigation with simple allegations.
**Especially** when there's more evidence proving his innocence than there is his guilt.
Let's see: she claimed 4 people were there and witnessed it.
The four witnesses says she's full of shit.
What happens next?
**New accuser**.
This shit is an insult to my intelligence.
Dems want an investigation that will take months.
Conveniently stalling until after midterms where they can resist.
How about take the FBI's word for it where they claim this shit is ridiculous: [https://i.redd.it/ato9op53w3n11.png](https://i.redd.it/ato9op53w3n11.png)
You‚Äôre going to accuse me of lying when your only source is a screenshot from FOX?
[here ](https://nypost.com/2018/09/18/man-said-to-be-in-room-during-alleged-kavanaugh-attack-refusing-to-testify/amp/) [ya ](https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/1350537002)[go](https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/9/18/17876320/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-mark-judge-sexual-assault-allegations) [bruh](https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/politics/2018/09/18/lindsey-grahams-bizarre-defense-not-making-brett-kavanaughs-friend-testify/) 

It‚Äôs pretty clear you will support Kavanaugh regardless of what facts come out.
If you have anything else to say, come with facts not pics üòè.
The picture is literally a screenshot of the FBI's own words.
Now you're being petty.
&gt;It‚Äôs pretty clear you will support Kavanaugh regardless of what facts come out.
The only facts that have come out disprove this nonsense.
Lol Everytime I chat you, it's petty bullshit like this.
I'm done here.
It actually wasn‚Äôt, it was the words from an ‚Äúunnamed Federal Law enforcement source‚Äù.
Ok, üëã.

So the 3 women who are accusing him of rape/sexual harassment can't be trusted on their words but Kavanaugh's college buddies can be trusted on their word?
That doesn't seem very consistent.
&gt; Kavanaugh's college buddies

Just because they was at the party doesn't mean they were "buddies"

The very witnesses that the accuser said was at the party says it never happened.
Okay... regardless, why believe his word over her word?
You're implying the witness has more credibility, in regards to that situation, than the accuser which he doesn't.
1. he's innocent until proven guilty.
Someones word isn't not proof.
Especially when you factor in the fact that she has participated in antitrump marches.
Her social media accts were a shitfest full of antitrump rhetoric which she deleted.
Even her lawyer participated in Antifa riots/protest while wearing a black power shirt.
They're both obviously bias and have it out for trump.
2. there's proof that she's lying.
Like eyewitnesses.
She doesn't remember the year it happened.
She doesn't remember how many people were involved.
She hates POTUS.
The people she said would defend her story says she's full of shit.
I mean, fuck.
What more do you need to see this all a scam to delay his nomination until after midterms so they can resist.
It's almost as if an investigation is in order to figure it out.

Summary: 
Accusations are not proof of anything.
There's no proof he did it.
2. there's proof that she's lying.
The four witnesses says she's full of shit.
She doesn't remember the year it happened.
