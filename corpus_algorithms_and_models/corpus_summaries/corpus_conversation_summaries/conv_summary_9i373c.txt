Original Response: 
Places near Cape Farewell in Greenland are fully glaciated while northern Canadian mainland is not, e.g.
places like Fort Smith at around 60°N.
Same goes on for places at 70°N, Cape Brewster in Greenland is glaciated while locations in Canada like Victoria Island aren't?
Same goes for places in Siberia of same latitude.
Why?
Average temperature is correlated with latitude, but it is not directly controlled by it.
See [this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Annual_Average_Temperature_Map.png) of average temperature across the globe.
How hot and cold air are able to move across land matters a lot.
So things like plains and mountains change where the air can go.
Ocean temperature also matters, and similar to the air, there are currents and parts of the ocean are warmer or colder because of those currents than you would expect just based on latitude alone.
Here's [a map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_surface_temperature#/media/File:SST_20131220_blended_Global.png) of that.

Well just by latitude England should have polar bears, it's that far north.
The gulf stream gives them a milder climate than New England.
Same latitude.
Point Pelee is quite mild compared to the rest of Ontario.
Not as warm as Barcelona.

Is there something similar that considers temperature extremes?
I assume that an average would not show extreme climate areas in a good way.
For example some parts of central Russia can have -40 in winter and +40 in summer.
I never would have guessed this in a million years.
My whole life has been a lie.

Yup, Rome is further north than NYC.
Ocean currents have a decent amount to do with local climate.
Here's a gif of temperature changing where you can see how much an area varies over the course of a year: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MonthlyMeanT.gif

And it really screwed with me when I went to Fort Sill, Oklahoma in the wintertime expecting warmer winter temperatures than my hometown.
Nope.

Short answer is the cordillera running along its west coast like a spine plus the fact that the land mass is "thinner" with respect to east-west, which means ocean currents more prominently affect the climate further inland.
[removed]
If it weren't for the huge system of currents called "the great ocean conveyer" or something like that bringing warm water up the Atlantic from the equator then Europe would be approx 8°c colder.
Well if you look at a globe with an equator, there is much more landmass above the equator than below.
So the very southern tip of Argentina is like the same distance from the equator as the border between US and Canada (probably a bit further, Buenis Aries is 2381mi and Edmonton is 3700mi), so most of South America is closer to the equator than most of North America.

Oslo is almost at the same latitude as Anchorage.
very different climates, however.
It’s because of the Gulf Stream keeping Europe unusually warm for its latitude.
Having said that though, Spain’s weather is perfect - just like California.
Even the vegetation and landscape is very similar.

A neat little trivia question is what's the northernmost Major League Baseball team (in history, if you want to make it slightly harder)?
No one ever guesses Seattle.
And they don't even have a domed stadium.

To be fair, Alaska's really tall and goes down a good chunk of Canada's west coast.
[removed]
[removed]
It's actually Alaskan Islands quite a ways off the coast that you would hit first.
About 80% sure the mainland part of Alaska doesn't extend down as far as London.
[removed]
Any idea why the map shows a colder patch exactly where Poland lies?
Yeah.
You might hit the Alaskan mainland if you left from Scotland, but definitely not from London.
A higher land:sea ratio.
Water takes a lot of energy to heat up and releases that energy slowly as it cools, whereas land heats and cools relatively rapidly (on the surface, anyway, it's much more stable once you get a few metres underground).

The southern tip of Chile is ~6200 km south of the equator.
The southernmost point of the Canada US border is ~4900 km north of the equator.
The longest straight stretch of border in the west is ~5400 km north.
Buenos Aires and Edmonton are about 210 km apart for what it's worth

E: ugh, you said Argentina not Chile.
I can't be bothered to figure out the comparison for Argentina.

Huh, I live in Poland and now notice a patch of lower annual temperatures in Central Europe basically forms an outline of modern Poland.
I never realized we're noticably colder compare to our neighbors, I wonder why that is.
Yes, London is about 51°30' N. Mainland Alaska only reaches to 54°40'.
But yes, eventually you'd probably hit some of the Delarof Islands in the Aleutians.

I wish we did have polar bears.
They're awesome.
Global warming is really screwing them over with regards to ice and subsequent hunting of their prey.
[removed]
Perhaps an effect of the Tatras?
[removed]
They're beautiful animals but they are one of the few predators on earth that think of humans as food.
Yeap, generally due to their inexperience and therefore lack of fear of our species.
They can be fairly easily deterred though (not speaking from experience I have to say).
As far as I know (from nature articles and documentaries  etc) tigers are the biggest killers of humans, another animal that we're actively driving to extinction.
Two huge predators, beautiful but deadly, that our activities are having a huge impact upon.
I really wish humans would wise up and protect and actively preserve animals.
Makes me sad

Also for bonus and less cuddly man eater check out [gustave the croc](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_(crocodile))
not to detract from the immenseness of that map, but it's super interesting how the American southwest/California has a solid line of temperate or warmer climates compared to the surrounding longitudinal axis

Edit: and how there's a pocket of super cold air past(or in)in the mountain range of northern India.
[removed]
[removed]
Well, technically the biggest animal killers of humans are mosquitos, who may have killed half the humans ever born.
Tigers do reap a decent harvest to this day but so do hippos.
Polar bears enjoy a fair amount of protection these days.
Have a friend who worked in northern alaska and he said that if you shoot a polar bear, you'd better have bite marks on your ass or you could be looking at prosecution.
This even though polar bears will pursue you actively, so it's on you to retreat to a vehicle or scare them off.
The Antarctica current which encircles Antarctica ensures that no part of Antarctica is ever allowed relief from freezing, but it also kind of keeps the cold bottled up there.
There's little circulation forcing the cold northward ever, it just spins around Antarctica (with the fastest ocean currents and wind speeds of any ocean, due to no land mass blocking it's path).
Antarctica had forests before it split from south America and the unimpeded current was allowed to form.
Now the only plants are a couple of small flowering plants in the Antarctic Peninsula.
It is also speculated that the formation of the unimpeded current 20 million years ago is what triggered the current ice age.
Duh, of course a place named **Pol**and has weather more similar to the poles.
People always seem to find that surprising (I know I did).
Everyone seems to expect the US and Europe to be 'parallel', but actually Canada's southern most town, Kingsville (42°6′N), is further south than the southern most mainland French village, Lamanére (42°21′40″N), and only fractionally further north than Rome (41°54′N).
You should see a map of the amount of snowfall it takes to close schools on average.
The Pacific Coast sticks out like a sore thumb, closing with much less snow than anywhere at that latitude on the continent.
Not sure why this is.
The California current is actually cold.
The Alaska current is warm (it keeps anchorage livable), but I don't think it begins until nearly the Canadian American border.

uh they have a very nice retractable roof stadium within walking distance of downtown.
and being on the West coast they dont get the severe winters like out East.

Sorry Guys but all the temp maps I I have seen on this thread are so wrong about Europe...
It looks like temp in UK are thesame than South of France or Spain...
Ain't possible...
Even between north of France and south of France the difference is massive.
something like 10-15 degres difference.
on all these maps, including top post, it seems the temp is quite the same or few degres.
[removed]
If I remember right, it has to do with the mountain ranges that run along almost the entire west coast.
They deflect the air currents from the continental US and allow the marine currents to dominate, which moderates the seasonal temperature swings to some extent.
That map shows the temperature **range**.
As in, the hottest a place gets minus the coldest.
In other words, if somewhere ranges from 10-20 degrees in one place and 30-40 in another, on the map you linked they would both show up as the same color.
&gt;and being on the West coast they dont get the severe winters like out East.
I think that was the point.
People don't guess Seattle because it's hard for people to associate Seattle with being very far North, since it's not known for getting much snow or very cold weather.
So hearing that Seattle is the Northern-most MLB team can help serve as a teaching moment for people to disassociate latitude with temperature patterns.
Or that Toronto is further South than Portland, Oregon seems to blow people's minds.
Had those two extremes right here in good ol' North Dakota, USA in the past year.
You realize California is an extremely large state with fairly unique vegetation across it?

Thanks for pointing this out.
For any non-Europeans reading this, Galicia is wetter, windier, often colder and even more miserable than Britain, which is really saying something.
Speaking of, the climate in mainland Britain varies pretty wildly (compare the microclimate of Cornwall to say, Aberdeen) and it's a fraction of the size of the Iberian peninsula.
Spain is nice (and actually I love the wind-whipped misery of Galicia) but anyone expecting a climate similar to Andalucia in Northern Spain is in for a big shock.
I wonder if this map were different if our cultures would be different.
If Europe were as cold as Canada, would early man have kept away?

I lived in Marbella, Anadlucia for a few years so it's synonymous with Spain for me.
But yes the north of Spain (I've been there a few times) is absolutely beautiful.
I also just said "California" - just like how you said Spain isn't just Andalucia, California isn't just LA.
You have Northern California which is also extremely similar to Northern Spain in climate and terrain.
I just didn't include that part to not make my comment longer than necessary.
But yes, California overall is similar to Spain overall.
San Tropez’s latitude is 65 miles north of Boston, so pretty much the same latitude as Maine.
There are no palm trees in Maine.
That number for southern Ontario is way too low though.
We had a 26 degree swing just in the last 24 hours.
Nevermind when winter comes.
Galicia has higher sunshine hours than anywhere in the UK and milder winters.
Its because the currents run clockwise.
Giving Cali cold water and Alaska warm water.
Areas that are located very far from large bodies of water (like central Russia) generally see large swings in temperature over the seasons.
The oceans act as a heat reservoir and help moderate the hot summer or cold winters, evening out seasonal temperature shifts.
This is similar to why deserts experience big temperature swings between day and night.
No moisture in the air means that there is nothing to hold onto heat that was accumulating during the daytime.
[removed]
[removed]
I think the number is meant as the divergence from the average.
Eg, if it's in the 15°C zone and the average is 10°C, it varies from -5°C to 25°C.
Otherwise I couldn't explain the values for Germany which lies in the 15 to 25 zones of the map and we clearly have much higher variation than that here (30°C+ Summers, -10°C Winters where I live).
Early man came to Europe when it was colder than today.
People with no technology also settled in Canada too but everyone forgets the native American's for some reason.
No, because *it was* as cold as Canada - or at least as cold as Canada is today(or colder).
Modern humans have been in Europe for 40,000 years but the last ice age only ended 10,000 years ago.
[removed]
According to this map the entire ocean is consistently -40°.
Crazy how nature does that.
Ottawa and Edmonton, Canada experience this on occasion.
This leads to a phenomenon of people bitching about the weather all year.

You can really tell how much wind currents have a effect on weather when hurricanes hit.
This last week in Nebraska was all 90's temps and super humid.
Then yesterday all the highs are 70 and below from there on out.
&gt; The Pacific Coast sticks out like a sore thumb, closing with much less snow than anywhere at that latitude on the continent.
One possible explanation - More steep hills and drivers who are less experienced in snow driving (due to less frequent snow).
yeah, i live in germanys hottest city and on our latitude there are still polar bears living in the wild in canada.
For me it's the Pirates.
Why were there pirates in the Pennsylvania anyways?
Isn't Death Valley supposed to be the hottest place on earth?
On that map it looks only yellow.
Maybe what I read was about peak temperature.
It annoys me that nobody has given you a decent answer yet, so I'm going to make that happen by offering some incorrect guesses.
That oughta flush our expert.
I think that Poland happens to lie just south of one of the larger unobstructed north-south air currents in Europe.
It originates in the Arctic, hops the small land bridge at the Swedish/Finnish border, gains strength as it blows south through the back-end of the frigid Baltic, and then disperses over Poland with virtually no vertical geography to stop or slow it down.
There, that's not the right answer, but it might buy us one a little later.
How does cornwall compare to the climate of say London?
Great Britain is a  island so how can it be a part of the mainland lol?
They were called that for poaching players from other teams back in the days of multiple major leagues, often sharing cities.

I just looked them up on Wikipedia and the their climates were surprisingly pretty similar.
The average daily high temperature in NYC is 62° F and in Rome its 68.7°.
Since we've branched off of the main topic...

You can drive south from Detroit to go to Canada.
Reno, Nevada is farther west than Los Angeles.
San Francisco has a similar latitude to ~~Cape May, NJ~~Chincoteague island, Viginia.
All of Florida is south of all of California.
The land area of Rhode Island fluctuates by 2-3% twice daily.
[removed]
The biggest difference lies in the winters, it seems

The average low during the coldest month (Jan for both places) is 26.9F in NYC and 37.6F in Rome.
[removed]
Yes.
Also, the ocean currents move a lot of heat around the world.
The Gulf Stream also keeps northeast Canada more temperate than Greenland.
How does Argentina have glacier considering it's average temp seems higher?
Is it just altitude?
True true.
If latitude **was** the only deciding factor in temperature, areas around the Mediterranean would be about as cold as New York City or New York City would be about as warm as those areas around the Mediterranean since the share the same approximate latitude.
(New York City fits **within** the range of Mediterranean latitudes.)
Oh man what did I miss?

San Francisco's closest cousin to the East is Richmond, VA, which is fairly significantly south of Cape May.

Oops.
You're right, I must have made a mistake somewhere.
It's about parallel with Chincoteague, which might have been what I was thinking.
I live less than an hour from Pelee Island and can attest to it being much much milder than other places I've lived in Canada.
The Gulf Stream doesn’t explain the intensity of the sunlight.
Besides the Spanish Rivera on into the French Rivera and then Italy.
All of this is hundreds of miles into the Med and away from the Atlantic.
Not to mention the Gulf Stream goes up US east coast then curls over to run along UK and then diminishes.
It [doesn't look that asymmetric to me](http://folk.uio.no/sigurdkn/world_temperature_mirrored.png).
The bulk of south america matches up pretty well with most of the USA and Canada when flipped around the equator.
The very tip looks a bit warmer, but it's very thin and therefore very coastal, and if we compare it with the west coast of North America at that latitude we see similar temperatures, albeit not stretching as far from the coast there.
It doesn’t look asymmetrical to me either.
The southern tip of Argentina is pretty damn far from the equator.
For sure, of course the southern border follows the mountains and it's quite obvious they should have an effect, stopping some Polar air from entering Czechia and Slovakia.
I'm more surprised about both Germany and Ukraine being warmer.
Not a lot going on at Poland's Eastern and Western borders, while the map indicates that all of Poland is as cold as Bavaria.
Thanks!
It seems like a good guess.
Here's another one:
Distance in more or less a straight line going WNW from El Paso, TX to the California state border across 1.5 states is nearly identical to the distance going ENE from El Paso, TX to Dallas, TX *all while staying inside the state of Texas.
