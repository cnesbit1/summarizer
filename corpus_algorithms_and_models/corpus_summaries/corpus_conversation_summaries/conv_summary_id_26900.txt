Original Response: 
I was always very grateful to Francis Ford Coppola for his version of Dracula, even if I hated the ending.
If blu-ray were like a VHS tape, my copy would have broke a long time ago, just because of this scene.
In my top 5 all time.
And Dracula's weird double bun hairdo.
I liked the weird hair.
It creates a creepy unsettling mood for the character.
I don't think I've seen Winona as high as top 5 in someone's list.
I'm curious now, who are the other 4 in you top 5?
She's in my Top 5 too.There,you found another.
In no particular order.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Salma Hayek, Karla Souza and Jane Levy.
A man of culture.
Oh nice, I like Mary and Selma a lot.
Haven't seen/heard too much of the other two though.

Summary: 
In my top 5 all time.
I liked the weird hair.
