Original Response: 
First, I want to apologize to the /r/conspiracy community about how this was handled.
The /r/conspiracy mod team is proud of our cohesiveness, and we are proud of our transparency, and this incident called into question both of these mandates.
We have public mod logs for a reason...we had no intention to remove /u/illuminatedwax without first informing the /r/conspiracy community.
However, as stated in previous threads, the removal of a top mod can be a long process, and we started that process several months ago.
We did *not* anticipate that a "bug" would remove wax *and* the rest of the mod team.
Now, much noise has been made about my actions after this bot's alleged mistake, namely that I didn't immediately invite back the rest of the team in the same order.
The reality is that inviting the team back, and having everyone accept in the same order, was going to be all but impossible (everyone has to be online at once which can be ferociously difficult to coordinate).
A similar situation actually arose less than a year ago when ex-mod SarahConnor unilaterally removed the entire mod team except for me and IW.
While I appreciate SC's passion and believe his intentions were good, that was *not* the way to go about it, especially on a /r/conspiracy sub.
As a result, getting the mod list back into the proper order required intervention from the reddit admins, and they removed SC as well, as this type of "rogue" moderator behavior is not tolerated, for obvious reasons.
Because of this previous experience, it was clear that we were going to need admin help again to restore the proper order of the team.
In the meantime, I suddenly found myself as the *only* mod of a 700k-strong sub, and it was approaching midnight my time.
It was clear that I couldn't go to sleep until *at least* one other mod was added again, as one can only imagine what would've happened while I slept.
After checking the modmail, I invited back the mods that were active recently and then immediately stickied the announcement about what had happened.
Fortunately, the sticky attracted the attention of several other mods, and by the end of the night I had re-invited all of the mods back to the team who were currently active in that thread.
With about half a dozen or so added back, I felt comfortable enough to finally go to sleep.
The next morning we immediately enlisted the help of the admins and they restored the list to the proper order, just as I had anticipated.
In addition, they apologized for what was apparently a mistake caused by a bot, and indeed they even thanked us for finding the bug!
Granted, I'm *well* aware that the optics of this transition are extremely poor (this *is* a conspiracy forum), and we've been working overtime to mitigate some of the damage.
Fortunately, I've prepared for instances like this after becoming accustomed over the years to receiving all manners of abuse and threats hurled my way.
This time it was no different, as a trifecta of threads at /r/subredditdrama, /r/drama, and /r/topmindsofreddit collectively called me a psychopath and were viewed tens of thousands of times.
Indeed, I received numerous threatening PMs and threats to doxx, not to mention the outright vitriol brimming from those threads.
Out of respect for the admins, I've waited for permission to share the screenshots of our interactions, as they should overwhelmingly corroborate everything I'm telling you.
[The first image](https://image.ibb.co/nEBt1p/aiwyhbfjhs.png) documents my formal request to have IW removed.
To remove an inactive top moderator of a large sub like /r/conspiracy, the rest of the mod team must demonstrate that they made a good faith effort to contact the top mod.
In addition, the mod team must vote on a "requestor" to assume the top position after the removal.
As the #2 mod, I was unanimously voted to be the requestor.
In the screenshotted message provided, I documented our vote for me as the requestor, as well as a thread detailing all of our attempts to contact IW.
As an aside, we've been attempting to contact IW for *years*.
The last time he wrote a comment in our sub was in 2013.
We *needed* his help when SarahConnor went rogue, and he wasn't there, requiring us to go to the admins.
Just so we're clear: *the admins don't want to deal with moderator drama.
*

For those who claim IW was a "failsafe"...he demonstrably was not.
The reddit admins are not in the business of dealing with moderator spats, and having an inactive top mod had already forced them to act.
For the benefit and future prosperity of this sub, the /r/conspiracy mod team needs to demonstrate both cohesiveness and independence from the admins, *especially* now that certain "controversial" sub are apparently on the chopping block.
To return to the first image, I was genuinely surprised to learn that I had permission to use the "redditrequest" function to have IW removed.
Because "redditrequests" can often take days and even weeks for the admins to act, I assumed my request was going to be no different.
In fact, I was in the middle of drafting the announcement for /r/conspiracy that we had formally made the request to remove IW.
Instead of taking days or weeks, this bug *immediately* removed IW *and the rest of the mod team* and I found myself in a very difficult position.
Although I had no clue what had happened or why, the one thing I was sure was that I was going to be viciously attacked (and boy was I ever).
[I've received permission to share this screenshot](https://image.ibb.co/mwRbMp/nlkjinasdklsjn.png).
I really, *really*, hope this satisfies the skeptics.
I recognize how poor the optics are here, and I'm doing everything I can to be as transparent as possible.
I'm not going to lie: I'm not pleased that I was put in this position.
Yes, uncomfortable experiences (and personal attacks) come with the terrain, but this seemed unprecedented in a lot of ways.
I also apologize for the locked/deleted threads pertaining to these issues.
Now that SRD and their ilk have started to move on, the "noise" should start to subside, and hopefully the attacks will too.
Having thicker skin is one thing, but simply standing by while thousands of people call you a psychopath is another thing entirely, *especially* when they're accusing you of something you demonstrably *didn't* do.
Please let me know if I can help explain things any further.
While much of the damage is already done, at the very least I can still offer this explanation for those who are still paying attention.
Thank you /r/conspiracy, and much love.
AP.
You mention cohesiveness a lot here so can we address the elephant in the room namely aliesters stated intention of removing creq from the mod team?
Thanks.
I'll have to let /u/aleister address this one, but from my observations they have mended things and are now quite cordial and cooperative with one other.
The mod team certainly has disagreements, but we try to deal with them in a mature and appropriate way, and ultimately they end up strengthening our bond.
Sounds reasonable.
Thanks for the reply.
/u/creq, would you agree?
Cheers.
np!
/u/creq has been taking a bit of a break for personal reasons but likely will chime in when he returns.
&gt;Sounds reasonable.
Thanks for the reply.
/u/creq, would you agree?
Cheers.
It's been a month and we haven't heard from xim/xer.
I'll give xim/xer another shout and maybe they'll show up.
