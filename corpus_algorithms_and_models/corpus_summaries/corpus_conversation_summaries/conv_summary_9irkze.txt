Original Response: 
Tbh the only real useful comparison would come with Khabib sparring The Mountain.
We would see Thor in a crucifix.
It would be hilarious to see Khabib on top of The Mountain, giving him boops and repeating "You know I deserve the Iron Throne.
Give up.
I deserve."
He already fought the mountain at UFC 196 and UFC 202.
His name is  Magomed Nurmagamedov, you killed his children, you raped him, SAY IT!
At the same asking Cersei to throw in the towel.
Be careful I'm gonna smash your boy.
Hafthor in a half-nelson.
Or the bear.
Here is McGregor vs the Mountain

I did not know we called Nate Diaz for the Mountain.
that would not be hilarious.
How's Noah?
Mountain guy vs The Mountain.
Fucking hell.
What a narrative!
That's the joke.
Apparently he's a fatherless bastard.
Man from the mountains vs. Mountain from the men.
The awkward moment when the Mountain goes for the head-crush but breaks both his hands on Dagestani granite.
Your boy, he is dying in here.
I think we all saw that The Mountain has lights-out power even from the bottom.
I don't think you understand.
Khabib is in the process of smesh!
Yeah, so was Oberyn.
In the process...
A hafth-nelson, if you will.
Chris Leben is shedding a tear somewhere rn.
Nate "The Mountain" Diaz does have a nice ring to it.

Summary: 
that would not be hilarious.
Mountain guy vs The Mountain.
Man from the mountains vs. Mountain from the men.
Khabib is in the process of smesh!
