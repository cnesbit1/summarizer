Original Response: 
Does anyone know of any place that cleans fine hats, particularly fedoras?
Why would you need your fedora cleaned?
You m'lady all over the top of it?
If you're being serious, which I'm actually questioning, that shoe repair place in the mall may be able to help.
They've helped repair and clean shoes, luggage, hats and other things made out of leather and other materials.
Try the trade center.
Im sure one of the places that sells cowboy hats can help you.
While we studied the location of places that might clean hats, he studied the blade.
Thank you.
I'm not sure why most people here thought I was joking.
I regularly wear fedoras and with the South Texas climate I have a hard time keeping them free from sweat stains.
I'll be sure to check them out.
If need be, I'll check them out as well.
Thank you.
If you find a place please let me know.
I have a couple of nice felt hats I inherited from my Grandmother that need cleaning and re-shaping.
Saved for future reference.
I'll let you know when I find time to go to one.
