But it happens to women at 5x the rate and it's different harassment based on their gender and gendered stereotypes.
Yep.
Women are harassed *for being women.

Multiple studies have shown men face more harassment online, though women face more sexual harassment.
&amp;#x200B;

"Overall, men are somewhat more likely to experience any form of harassing behavior online: 44% of men and 37% of women have experienced at least one of the six behaviors this study uses to define online harassment. "
"men (30%) are modestly more likely than women (23%) to have been called offensive names online or to have received physical threats (12% vs. 8%)"

The same study shows that women experience far more severe harassment and are targeted based on sex.
