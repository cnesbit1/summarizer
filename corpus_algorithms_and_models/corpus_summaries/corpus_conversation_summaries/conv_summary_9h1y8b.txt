Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario.
If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request.
We'll probably grant it.

Prediction: Colby stunningly knocks out Tyron, eventually becomes the USAâ€™s Conor and they meet at 165 to open up the weight class.
MMA gods please.
Lord Colby VS King Conor would make me rip the fattest of nuts.
Edit: Colby/Khabib at 165 would be interesting as fuck.
I'd rather see Conor/Ferg before this scenario, but I'd take it as well.
He couldn't even light up Demian fucking Maia so I have no idea how he lands anything on Woodley.
Conor is the USA's Conor.
Holy shit are you that biased?
If Maia didn't get lit up in that fight then neither dis Jose Torres against Erik Perez.
Colby was losing a striking match until Maia gassed, that's all that needs to be said about that.
Maia literally gassed because he has never in his career landed that many clean shots on another fighter.
Somebody needs to rewatch a fight.
Dude, go back to the live thread.
It's all K-1 Maia jokes until he gassed out.
Or I could just watch Maia get battered for 15 minutes again instead of forming my opinion on a fight based on memes.

Summary:
