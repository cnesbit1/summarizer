Original Response: 
I recently moved to Corpus Christi for work and am looking for gyms.
The only gym that seems to have a basketball court is Gold's Gym, but membership is kinda pricey.
Since I only play on occasion and not religiously, I'm wondering if there are any decent, public courts.
I live in the South Side, but would not mind the drive if it's worth it.
Most parks on the south side have courts.
They may not be well lit, full size or freshly painted, but if you just want to play a quick game or two, they should suffice.

Acushnet park on Arron has a ball court.
There's a big catholic church on Cimarron, with a covered court in the back parking lot.
It's open to the public, AFAIK.
I've played there a couple of times with my Brother-In-Law.

Summary: 
Most parks on the south side have courts.
