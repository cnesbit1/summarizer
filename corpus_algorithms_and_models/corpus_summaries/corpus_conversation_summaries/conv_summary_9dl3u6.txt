Get outta here panger.
The Wings broadcaster Mickey Redmond also says holy jumpin.
Miss me with that Blues shit.
(JK; I do like Panger but was explaining why OP likely said that since this is a Wings draft pick.)
Aaah I didn’t know Redmond also said it.
Makes more sense now lol - thanks!
He also says bingo bango a lot.
Drinking ginger ale.
I can't wait to hear Mick's voice again today.
The Tigers announcers had a physical altercation this week because they hate each other, we're lucky with the Ken &amp; Mickey duo that carries us.
Ken and Mickey are legit best pals too.
When Kens son passed away Mickey was the first person to call him.
In my sales meeting today, my coworker broke the news about the Tigers guys to us.
First thing I said was “Ken and Mick would never do that.”.
He doesn't want to live in the Congo?

Summary: 
Ken and Mickey are legit best pals too.
Aaah I didn’t know Redmond also said it.
