If you’re remotely interested in Nike vs adidas you should check out the business wars podcast on the subject.
Hah!
I came here to say the same thing.
"Business Wars: Nike v Adidas."
I think it comes down to just one thing and you don’t need a podcast for it, Yeezy &gt; Nike’s entire catalog.
Yeezys came out in 2015.
And now I could be wrong, but I believe the history of these two companies predates that.
By two years at least!
Fake Chinese Yeezy &gt; "Real" Yeezy.
Nah.
Basically anything with a Boost sole is giving Nike Air/Zoom a run for its money.
Everything with a Primeknit upper is challenging Flyknit.
All the radical designs that once differentiated Nike are being match by great looking adidas products.
As a sneaker head, I love it because the consumers win when companies compete fiercely.
The thing about the fakes is they’re made using the same materials from the same suppliers.
And then you have fake manufacturers like Off-White Factory doing their own in-house product testing.
This statement is as egotistical and embarrassing as Kanye himself!
Bravo!
Thank you for suggesting this podcast!!!
Just started with Netflix vs Blockbuster and I’m in love.
I dabbled in adidas but that kapernick campaign actually makes me want to sport the Nike brand.
Makes me want to do the exact opposite.
Fuck kaepernick.
Oof, why exactly do you have such a hatred for the guy?
Politics?
The game?
Guy is clearly dumb as fuck don’t waste your time.
I don't necessarily agree but he had an opinion, that doesn't make him dumb as fuck.
That’s how you end up with Trump as President.
Call out the lies, call out the bullshit, shame the racists.
They don’t deserve reason or understanding or the benefit of the doubt.
That’s funny cause I feel the exact opposite.
I don’t like kaepernick’s Afro.
Yeah, fuck that guy for trying to raise awareness to an issue that the rest of the world can’t believe still happens in 2018.
Do you have this much hate for Trump?
He not only slandered McCain, a war hero but he also offended the parents of a soldier who died for his country.
Oh and let’s not forget he didn’t have the balls to serve either.
Racist much?
Being critical of blind patriotism and contemporary racial inequality is all well and good, but I can't help but feel cynical about Nike trying to cash in on it when they're still on their sweatshop shit.
He's a T_D user, just move on.
Sweatshop shit, huge sexual harassment culture..yeah they need to chill on the virtue signaling.
Using sweatshops?
I sleep.
Sexual Harassment?
I sleep.
Sponsored Kaepernick?
REAL SHIT?
!
Don’t all of them use sweatshops?
What issue is that?
Black on black crime and gang violence?
I suggest you stop posting pics of keyboards and go do some research about what the whole kneeling thing is about.

What?
This angry, bald old white man and his ridiculous beard analogy is meant to change my mind?
The guy is a no body.
I mean seriously, comparing this to Nike sponsoring a terrorist?
Fuck off.
KP is raising awareness about injustice and police brutality.
Not enforce sharia law.
Why do some white people get so butt hurt about black people to be treated equally and it be killed for doing nothing?
Just know, the rest of the world is judging you.
For me personally this comes down to quality.
From my experience in mostly running shoes and football/soccer apparel the quality of Adidas is far superior to Nike.
I'm with you.
I actually got a (temporary, contract) job with Nike at the world HQ in Oregon not too long ago.
One of the "not required, but strongly suggested" things is to always wear Nike footwear.
I bought a pair of $80 shoes, with the understanding that I wouldn't be wearing them more than really, the small walking distances a commute by car requires.
Basically, traversing the parking lot and walking around an office building a small bit.
They were ostensibly "walking" shoes.
In the 3 months I was there, the topmost eyelet for laces broke.
One of the heel loops (for pulling the shoe on) broke, and the tread on the shoes was all but worn through at major pressure points in the shoe.
It was the sort of shit I'd expect from a pair of Payless shoes that cost $10, not Nike.
Their quality has gone downhill _fast_ in the past few years.
If you want higher quality walking shoes might I suggest the brand Hoka One One.
Honesty, my go to is just to accept my status as dad-age and pretend New Balance in various colors is fashionable.
I've got some foot problems and NB seem to keep the pain to a minimum.
Agreed, I’ve owned several pairs of Nike’s and they always seem to fall apart fairly quickly, notably the glue on the sole is terrible.
It always starts to loosen and the sole starts to come off after 6-8 Months.
If you need an expandable upper mesh, I’d avoid Hoka and suggest new balance’s 990’s or fresh foams.
If the pain is from arthritis, no shoe will fix that, the closest thing to dealing with that problem, I’d go for Keen or On shoes (they advertise as running be the insole is flexible enough to make a nice fit)
Wore my Nike Vapormax everyday for the whole summer because I was always at work, my job involves me being on foot going back and forth.
They got dirty, tossed them in the washer and they look good as new, no problems with them.
Granted, they were $190 vs the $80 shoes you bought.
If you want something to last you while the shoe being comfortable, the Vapormax is well worth it.
Don't get Roshes, but you can opt for the Vapor Street, epic react, or the Free Run.
Thankfully, it's not arthritis.
It's a combination of diabetic neuropathy and unrelated but just as shitty, a minor stump neuroma left over from a Morton's neuroma.
The key for me and manner of the game is support in all the right places.
Have metcon 4s for the gym and Hoka One One Cliftons for running.
I thought the huge soles would make me look like a spice girl but they’re amazing.
Bought nike running shoes for 120 euro, 2 months of everyday use later the glue used had failed.
Bought DC shoes for running again, 2 month later the glue had failed, same with addidas, buy shoes that were stitched together.
Nikes 6.0 with a stitch have been going strong for 3 years now, my timberlands with a stitch have been good for 4 years, now I'm thinking of getting these cool new kicks from reebok cause they have a nice big stitch thru the entire bottom of the shoe, I'd wager they underside of the shoe will be the thing that gives.
Yeah, it's about the construction, not the brand.
They all come from the same mega Chinese factories.
All the knit style shoes disintegrate on me.
Tbh some pairs are fashionable LOL.
That's the spirit!
Honestly, Adidas just have a better streat design game the past years.
Nike hasn't really done anything fresh in a long time.
Nike.com is featuring a pair of Jordans that look like they were designed in 1995, the Air Max are also highlighted ...
These shoes were designed in the 90s.
Adidas actually made a fresh new design with the Ultraboost, NMDs, and their trainers.
Bought James Hardens Shoes which are made by Addidas.
Not only are they pretty slick looking, they are the most comfortable shoes I've put on.
None of the nike shoes I tried even came close to them.
They are also making inroads to other markets that may be very lucrative in the future.
Their 5 Ten brand is the bomb for anyone who doesn’t want to be clipped in on a bike, and the sticky rubber makes for a great trail running shoe.
This was valid a year of two ago, back when Ultraboost and NMD were fresh.
Nike definitely won the last 12 months.
What did they release in the mean time?
I literally just looked through their website, and there's no big new design?
They are highlighting shoes that were designed 30+ years ago.
Calling Adidas "old" when their stuff is 1-3 years old is laughable in comparison.
Not sure how so many nike releases have passed you by.
Huge Off white colab, Kaws colab, Mars Yard, Vaporfly, Vapormax, worthwrspoon airmax 91, React Element, Odyssey React.
NMDs are already dead because Adidas beat that horse to death.
I'm not sure if you're kidding ... but:

Literally 70% of those shoes you mentioned are old models with a slight tweak.
You think that the Airmax 91 is "fresh" but the NMD's are beaten to death?
It's literally a model from 1991 ... it's in the name man.
React Element is literally also a re-design of another model.
It says it in the damn description.
&gt;Odyssey React.
It's literally a different model of the react shoe ...

How the hell are NMDs, a 3 year old shoe, beaten to death ... but Nike shoes that are 20+ years old are "fresh releases"?
I'm not saying the shoes are ugly ...
I'm just saying that if I already own 4 pair of Airmax, then the Wortherspoon model isn't gonna get me out of my chair.
It's probably the 300th iteration of the Airmax shoe.
Literally every single shoe you mentioned is a tweak of an old design, albeit 2 of them had larger tweaks - most of the others are practically just color alterations.
But hey ... don't take my word for it: Adidas has gone from 5-6% market share in 2016 to an estimated 14% in mid 2018.
Adidas stoke has gone up 22% from 2016 - 2017, Nike was flat, and Under Armor dropped.
Adidas is making moves, and consumers are responding.
Nike is the comfortable giant, and they're losing, at least in the short game.
Not the person you're replying to, but I can't help but to set some things straight:

&gt;It's literally a different model of the react shoe

No it's not, that's like saying Yeezy Boosts are a redesign of UltraBoost.
React is Nike's in-house cushioning technology/material.
I agree that Adidas' marketshare will continue to grow, but what the original commenter was saying is that (in the sneakerhead/hypebeast community at least), it's generally agreed that Nike has been putting out better sneakers this year.
["Boost is dead"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sneakers/search?q=boost+is+dead&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all) is practically a meme on sneaker forums.
&gt;if I already own 4 pair of Airmax, then the Wortherspoon model isn't gonna get me out of my chair.
Lol I know it's a bad example but that's one of the most sought after sneakers this year and despite constant restocks the [resale prices remain sky high.

Again, not disagreeing with you.
Just providing some context.
I think sneakerheads make up a relatively small amount of the market.
I'm not sure how many new shoes they buy, but people hanging out in forums dedicated to a niche are probably not the only metric worth considering.
You could literally just look at market share, and see how it's dropping.
Sneaker-heads can say what they want.
You literally just pointed out how they don't care if the only change to a new shoe is color, they covet it because it's rare.
Also, your link shows 12 posts over a 2 year period.
Even in the niche what you're saying seems to be something a few fanboys have been pushing.
Time will tell, but the idea that models that are 1-3 years old are "dead", but the same shoe re-colored 500 times is "fresh" (hello Airmax, Airmax 97, Air Force 1) is an outright joke.
&gt; I think sneakerheads make up a relatively small amount of the market.
I was in agreement with you until now.
Brand perception is important - especially in fashion.
Ultraboost was not well received by runners, let alone the fashion world when it was first released in 2015.
You could walk into any retail store and find the full range of colours.
They were sitting on shelves until Kanye West wore them during a concert.
3 years on, it's known as Adidas' "best sneakers" to non-sneakerheads.
Like it or not, we shouldn't belittle the effect that tastemakers and influencers have on fashion.
It's no coincidence that Adidas footwear's marketshare which had been steadily declining since 2011 started picking up again in 2016.
You're right that Adidas is doing well this year, but cracks are starting to show.
Ultraboost is no longer as desirable, and even the recent Yeezy releases which used to command resell prices of several hundred dollars have [lost their value.

If that's not enough to convince you, [they're also losing a lawsuit against Puma and may lose the right to sell sneakers with Boost \(it's licensed from BASF, which manufactured Puma's original "boost" formula\).

&gt;your link shows 12 posts over a 2 year period.
Yeah, that's just Reddit's shitty search function that doesn't include comments.
There're hundreds of results for boost+is+dead+site:www.reddit.com on Google.
&gt;the idea that models that are 1-3 years old are "dead", but the same shoe re-colored 500 times is "fresh" (hello Airmax, Airmax 97, Air Force 1) is an outright joke.
It may seem counter-intuitive to you but it's true.
They've always been classics which enjoyed strong sales, but it's more popular than ever this year because 90s "dad shoes" is now a thing in fashion.
It's a matter of taste - just because it's different from yours, it doesn't mean it's wrong.
The colabs are existing silhouettes, and they are the most desirable sneakers released in the last 2 years.
Some commanding thousands.
Wotherspoons i got the name wrong.
They’re 97/1 and are a new silhouette.
The rest are no less innovative than ultraboost.
NMDs are dead in that they are no longer desirable because of over saturation of low quality general releases.
The nike silhouettes your comparing them to are timeless, like the Stan Smiths and Superstars of Adidas.
You’re also fundamentally misunderstanding the implication of gaining market share.
Closing the gap on Nike does not mean they are beating them.
When you gulp up 7% market share in 1 year you are definitely beating your competition.
It doesn't mean you will beat them next year, but you beat them this year.
If we go by your definition then nobody is beating anybody, unless they go bankrupt.
&gt;Wotherspoons i got the name wrong.
They’re 97/1 and are a new silhouette.
It's not a new silhouette, it's the same silhouette as before.
The details have just changed a tiny bit.
Calling that a new silhouette is extremely disingenuous.
The name is even the same, *airmax 91*.
&gt;NMDs are dead in that they are no longer desirable because of over saturation of low quality general releases.
The nike silhouettes your comparing them to are timeless, like the Stan Smiths and Superstars of Adidas.
Again, I guess time will tell.
I'm sure plenty of people like you said the same about those shoes when they were a few years old, and here we are ... almost 30 years later and they are still just tweaking slight details and releasing them as "new" shoes.
No, losing by less is not beating.
Plus you’re referencing 2016 when adidas was ahead.
What do you mean same as before?
There is no before.
It’s a new shoe.
I don’t think you know what you’re talking about on this one.
&gt;No, losing by less is not beating.
Plus you’re referencing 2016 when adidas was ahead.
Actually the 7% increase was from 2016 - 2017, which I believe goes from summer &gt; summer.
&gt;What do you mean same as before?
A silhouette is the shape of a shoe.
If you make a B&amp;W silhouette of the Airmax 91 and the Wortherspoon then you'll see that they look practically identical.
Tweaking a few details (like making the swoosh smaller and adding Airmax 97 features) is not the same as making a new Silhouette (Say Air Force 1 vs Airmax 91)

I'm not sure if this is simply terminology, but if so then you're using the word silhouette wrong.
&gt;It’s a new shoe.
Yeah, it's a new shoe.
But it's an old design that they took and tweaked.
Hence the name: Wotherspoon **air max 91**.
It's literally in the name man.
&gt;I don’t think you know what you’re talking about on this one.
It's quite literally in the name.
It's almost like you're arguing that the newest iteration of the Spiderman Origins is a brand new thing.
They've taken a story that's been beaten to death, with a character that's beaten to death, and then re-done it.
Yeah, it's a "new movie", but we've all seen it before.
We know the story, we know the bad guy, we know the good guy.
Applying new CGI doesn't make it "brand new &amp; fresh".
It doesn't make it bad, but it's definitely not a new concept or new brand ... hence the name.
I don’t know how you can go to so much effort crafting a long winded reply, and not do a basic image search and realise the Airmax 91 is a completely unrelated different shoe.
Clearly you aren’t that informed about the subject you’re debating on, so i shall no longer engage.
I literally did ...

Mate ... it's in the bloody name.
Do you think they named it the Wotherspoon **Air Max 91** because it has nothing at all to do with the Air Max 91?
Just google them yourself, they are the same silhouette with tweaked details.
I said i wouldn’t reply, but its irresistible.
As i said 5 or 6 messages ago.
The name is not Air Max 91.
It is  Wotherspoon Air Max 97/1.
Airmax 91 is vastly different.
I can’t understand your inability to google search...
Oh sorry ...
I meant the Air Max 97.
Didn't realize I typed it wrong.
I bought a pair when they released back in the late 90s, when they were all the rage among techno fans.
But the original 97s and the Wotherspoon are the same silhouette.
It's literally minor details they have altered and released as a "new" shoe, again.
That's a 21 year old shoe that has been re-released with slight tweaks again, and again, and again, and again, and again ...

Summary: 
Yeah, it's a new shoe.
I was in agreement with you until now.
I came here to say the same thing.
It's not a new silhouette, it's the same silhouette as before.

None of the nike shoes I tried even came close to them.
"Business Wars: Nike v Adidas."
It is  Wotherspoon Air Max 97/1.
