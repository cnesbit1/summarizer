Are any of our local channels available to stream on vue, directvNow, or any like that?
Get a digital antenna from amazon or Wal-Mart.
It's around $15 and no monthly payment.
Yea I’ve got one but I’m lookin to have it as a service .
I think direct tv has locals.

KRIS and KIII appear to be on the Roku, but I don't know how up-to-date their app is.
I'm  pretty sure the local channels aren't live on any streaming device.
I've tried pretty much all of them.
I decided to stick a digital antenna in my attic and have been happy with the results ever since.
A universal antenna will pick up most local channels in the area.
I use one downtown, I get about 6 English speaking channels, and a host of Spanish speaking channels.Beyond that, I would recommend you get a HTPC and setup KODI or some such for streaming.

Summary: 
I think direct tv has locals.
