Hi guys,I'm Moving to CC in two weeks and the only thing that I'm worried about is furniture, Do you guys recommend buying furniture from San Antonio instead of CC?
Or are they both priced the same?
I'm only looking to buy a couch, bed and a study desk for the time being.
Any advice would be appreciated!
I don't really know the pricing for furniture in San Antonio but I do know that you can get some good furniture at Chubby's for decent prices.
I got my bedroom set from furniture row and really liked them.
The place I used to go to a lot has closed I believe.
If you have access to NAS Corpus Christi they have a furniture gallery where you can buy Ashley furniture at pretty low prices.
They dont have commission and sell pretty much for what they buy it for.
I bought a couch from them which was selling for about $1850 retail at the Ashley store in town for about $700.
If you don't have access to base, i would suggest going to antique stores, garage sales or craigslist for hardwood furniture.
For sofas and beds i would suggest buying new or at least from someone you know fairly well.
(Bed bugs) I ordered my bed from [Amazon] (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008KQ8YZO/ref=twister_B008KQ8X82?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1), which was risky but it turned out to be a great bed.
I do have to mention that San Antonio will have a much larger selection of furniture, but you do have to consider how you will get it down to Corpus if you buy it up there.
And the prices will be about the same if not cheaper in Corpus depending on where you shop.
