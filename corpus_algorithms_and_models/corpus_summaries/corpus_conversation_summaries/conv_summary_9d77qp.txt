If anyone is willing to trade, I’ll be ready to trade this pokemons until the end of the night.
Hi.
I don't have the Conkeldurr you're looking for but I can breed you an HA Timburr in a Dream Ball if you'd like that.
I’d love this!
What will you want in return?
The HA Eevee will do.
Just need a little bit of time to breed the Timburr.
Take your time!
I’ll make an egg right away!
Tell me when you ready, okay?
Sure.
I will.
Hi!
I have one ready!
Btw do you want a male or a female?
Because I hatched both genders.
Cool, I need a few more min.
I’ll go with the female :)
Sounds good.
Just let me know when.
(:
sure!
i’m ready.
I'll add your FC and will be online shortly.
already online at Plaza.
I don't see your IGN listed in your flair yet.
I have to change it, I’m Gabriel.
Ah now I see.
Enjoy your Timburr!
Thank you very much!

Np.
