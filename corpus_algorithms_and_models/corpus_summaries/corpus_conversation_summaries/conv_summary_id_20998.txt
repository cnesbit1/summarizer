Original Response: 
I don't blame him at all for having a thing for his step sister!
Is it weird that Joe encourages it?
Nah, Barry is adopted, so there's nothing wrong with that at all.
Plus Joe is the ultimate super dad.
He was in love with her before Joe adopted him, and Joe knows that, so I suppose it's fine ?
Seriously, the best character on the show is Joe.
Always dependable, reliable, understanding and good hearted.
Just wants to protect the city and care for his 3 kids.
Maybe he'll open up a restaurant in Santa fe.
I understand this reference.
