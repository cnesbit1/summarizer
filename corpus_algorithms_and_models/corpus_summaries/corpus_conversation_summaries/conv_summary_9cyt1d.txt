Original Response: 
how is he even alive?
I've seen and met many humans in my life, that guy is definitely not human anymore.
I doubt he makes it to 50 tbh.
Ha, check out this pic.
The other guy is a Dutch bodybuilder named Olivier Richters

There's always someone bigger than you.
He's taller, but funnily enough not bigger.
Idk, I think I might call him bigger as well.
Ford’s arms don’t look all that much more impressive imo, and Richters is at least 6” taller.
If you check out his IG he looks surprisingly broad-shouldered for a guy his height.
Although according to their “listed” weights, he’s only about 20 pounds heavier.

What a little head.
Oh, okay, he must’ve gotten bigger.
I remember reading he was only like 300 pounds.
Ya I think he’s added a lot of size recently-ish.
I remember the first time I came across him online he hadn’t been lifting seriously for very long.
His IG says he’s a little over 340 but looking at some pics I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s a little low.
&gt;only like 300 pounds.
what world are we living in?
That's like... Struve if he was jacked lol.
It's like in Men In Black when the shopkeeper gets his head blown off and it starts growing back lol.
Wtf.
Overeem for scale https://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/991678/AmQcqy-CAAET00A.jpg.
Damn, look at the size of Reem’s knuckles.

Summary: 
I remember reading he was only like 300 pounds.
Ha, check out this pic.
