Short of genocide, what do you mean when you say 'get rid of the Republican party altogether'?
Confused here, I'm a Republican and I am very much not ok with sexual assault.of any kind whatsoever.
The entire party is corrupt and no one associated with it (now, in the past, or in the future) should be allowed to be a government employee or lobbyist of any kind.
No murder necessary.

See: current republican President.

Not a great recent track record.
Trump, Moore, Porter, Manafort, O’Reilly, Ailes, this list goes on.
At least the Democrats held Franken accountable, Republicans never ever do and usually smear the victim in the process.
And yet you're fine with a president who is the poster child for sexual predators and who nominates sexual predator supreme court justices.
How do you enforce that or create such a rule?
Then vote against people who commit it.
Unless you’re all for the grab-them-by-the-pussy president, in which case you are totally okay with sexual assault, you just want to claim that you’re not.
This is what happens when you operate on feels instead of reals.
Fascism.
Have a *republican lite* party form.
Then when everyone votes, the majority seats will be held by this new party and the Democrats.
The current republicans will be pushed into obscurity.
Really?
You voted for a serial sexual assaulter, which I might add, has been known for decades.
Or maybe I represent me and only me.
Do you think people murdered all the Whigs?
Yes.
I'd ask why they're supporting a president who is a sexual predator.
What case number was the filing for that confirmed his sexual predator charge, I'm having problems finding it.
[removed]
The Whigs destroyed themselves with anti immigrant rhetoric with a potato famine in Ireland.
You must live in the magic land of Throw the Bum out and put my Bum in.
Is it nice there, I hear they have good coffee?
Republicans seem to be protecting members of their party abused of sexual assault while Democrats are more likely to throw that person under the bus so to speak.
Republicans have fought tooth and nail to defend these guys to a scale that you don't see from Democrats.
I mean Republicans talking heads and fox news.
The establishment, etc.
Not necessarily all constituents (though lots of them).
Hope it implodes and is reborn as something more reasonable.
Remember when he not just admitted, but bragged about committing sexual assault?
I just asked my neighbor if a republican ever assaulted her sexually and she said no.
Then I was asked to leave because I love next door to a restaurant.
They asked that like it was a gotcha question or something and not a self evident answer.
So delusional.

[deleted]
Cool.
So how do you feel about all the other Republicans who are fine with sexual assault?
[removed]
Read my lips.....You Voted For One To Be Your President.
[deleted]
&gt; The fact that you seem to genuinely believe that a huge group of Americans are OK with sexual assault is concerning.
Accusations of sexual assault certainly haven’t been deal breakers in the past few years, now have they?
You dont know who I voted for.
Well if I hear someone say "I am fine with sexual assault" I would certainly request that they should not be part of any party or be a public figure.
I do remember the statement.
However context is everyrhing.
In what context is bragging about sexual assault acceptable?
I am sorry that things seem that way.
If you of someone who has been sexually assaulted I recommend you contact your local police department and file a report.
Lol please give actual evidence.
Like a case number, like you ask for with trump.
So you didn’t vote for Trump then I’m assuming.
And you must have been disgusted with the Roy Moore situation?
Never watch any Fox News?
Or does none of it count unless they literally say the sentence “I am okay with sexual assault” and all their actions that demonstrate it are excused away?
I dont know Republican politicians personally.
So I cant say that I know their stance on those issues.
Csn you give me a specific statement or action?
Probably the same that killing unborn children is.
I thought we were entertaining hyperbole, my bad.
What the fuck?
Trolling?
When did I say it was an actionable idea?
Quiet, loser.
&gt; Republicans never ever do and usually smear the victim in the process.
Taking a page from the Clinton Playbook.
Hillary is one of the smeariest smearers ever to smear, mostly in defense of her husband whose accusations far exceed Trump's by every possible metric.... but so many Democrats were 100% willing to look past all of that.
IMO if you're going to consider people guilty until proven innocent in regards to how you vote, you have to apply that rationale to *everyone* from *both parties*.
Full disclosure: am not a Republican or a Democrat, dislike them both *greatly* and haven't voted for any of them since the early 1990s.
Hillary isn’t the best but if you think she’s done things worse than Trump you’re out of your mind.
Anything is possible in Shouldland!
We desperately need to get rid of the current Democrat party too.
If nothing else, the shenanigans surrounding the primary should convince you of that.
(But there are *plenty* more reasons...)
I'm a registered Democrat and voted for Hillary in 2016, begrudgingly.
That being said, the Democratic Party and those who vote Democrat do not have a monopoly on good ideas.
Illegal (emphasis illegal) immigration is one specific area where I think the Democratic Party has worse ideas.
And it's a pretty failed strategy to vilify 25% of the population and accuse them of being supporters or enablers of sexual assault.
If you strongly believe that you are justified in doing so, I wonder if you believe it would be reasonable to hold every single Democrat who, like me, voted for Hillary in 2016 to that same standard.
She she was very much a part of the defense of her husband's sexual assault, and voters in both the primaries and general election who voted for Hillary didn't demand that Bill Clinton be isolated from the campaign and potential administration.
Bill Clinton is no better than Harvey Weinstein.
He wielded his power on numerous occasions to fulfill his desires, at the expense of those who didn't have the power to resist or refuse.
To the OP two levels up:
I think it's illogical for you to ignore the history of the Republican Party (the party of Lincoln and Emancipation) when it suits you, ignore the history of the Democratic Party (many of whom destroyed that poor young girl Ms. Lewinsky, the victim) when it suits you.
Maybe Republicans are voting based on a single issue or multiple issues that are more important to them.
I certainly had to swallow a bunch of things I couldn't stand about HRC when I voted for her.
Does that mean I support shaming sexual abuse victims?
I hope not.
It's a ethics question isnt it?
If you aren’t “aware” of any already you’re not talking to me in good faith.
You’d have to have been living under a rock to not know about the Roy Moore situation.
Sean Hannity defended him.
Republicans were saying shit like they’re be fine with him pursuing their teenaged children.
You know damn well what I’m talking about.
Your reply was a complete non sequitur.
Let's try this again: In what context is bragging about sexual assault acceptable?
You don’t know their stance on a multitude of issues that are public knowledge and therefore have no opinion about them but you’re fine with voting for them?
Lol.
Who said specifically that they were fine with that, unfortunately a reporter doesn't represent my belief system or morals, they report and give opinion, probably more opinion than is needed.
It's like Bill Clinton never even existed.
It must be nice to have a worldview where you have convenient excuses to not feel bad about the awful politicians you support.
I think you are assuming whom I have voted for.
Also i cannot vote on politicians in states i do not reside in.
Oh, so you voted for Hillary?
Not desperately.
Compared to republicans defending nazis and pedophiles, not believing in climate change, and some believing that the earth is only 6000 years old.
Democrats are a messy room.
Republicans are a forest fire.
One take priority to correct more than the other.
That's pretty naive, especially after you said you belonged to a particular group.
Wait are you for real?
You really can't know?
Their views are publicly available.

I mean, people voted for Donald trump.
Even Roy Moore almost won his election.
Are you a troll or just dumb?
I see what you're doing here, controlling the narrative on human sexuality on a reddit thread on a pro women's topic wont work for me sadly.
If you're not ok with his statement then there should be some heavy consideration to a myriad of other social and sexual topics.
When a woman grinds her pelvic area on a mans face it's ok because he tossed some money on the stage first?
You cant have it both ways.
Women use sexual position for power just as much as men do.
I do not disclose whom I voted for.
[removed]
Truth sucks I know.
I just dont react to the first knee jerk comment is all.
If Roy Moore did pursue someone teenage daughter, than yes, he should not he in office.
I'm not controlling anything.
I'm commenting on Reddit.
You won't answer my question, which is very interesting.
You're just saying "women do bad things too!"
As if that makes men sexually assaulting women okay.
A woman being a stripper is not comparable to sexual assault unless she gives a non consensual lap dance, and if a man paid for it then chances are he is consenting.
That you think it is reveals much about how you see women.
&gt;If you're not ok with his statement then there should be some heavy consideration to a myriad of other social and sexual topics.
So you approve of sexual assault.
[deleted]
[removed]
I believe women and men both use sex to promote their power or subdue people this is not a New Concept and has been going on for much longer than either of us are probably aware of.
That being said yes I do think the Donald Trump should not have said those things but then again Donald Trump is not a politician.
Unfortunately the political arena is ripe with character assassination and many other disingenuous activities.
Do I feel that Donald Trump is a great person?
Not really.
But his heart is in the right place.
Not to say that a means to an end is a great thing but on the other hand the direction of our country is more important than his potential character flaws and I think I speak for a lot of people with that stance.
If we wanted a person of pure character then we would have voted in a priest not to say that's even a impeccably clean position anymore with the recent accusations will not even recent but many of the accusations that have come from people regarding Church leadership and sexual activity.
But to answer your question it is not okay to brag about sexual assault but the terms sexual assault have many different viewpoints if I were to accidentally brush my hand against a woman's backside when I passed by her on accident would be considered sexual assault by many people.
We're not talking about mistakenly touching someone though we are talking about something else I understand that.
If this was truly a sexual assault situation then there would be at least one woman who stepped forward and said hey I was the person he was talking about when he made that comment and that would be a whole different scenario.
He bragged about sexual assault.
That is not debatable.
Grabbing someone's genitals without consent is sexual assault.
Where is this person at that had this done to them and why did they not step forward.
The vast majority of victims do not stop forward because it's generally an additional traumatic experience on top of the original trauma.
I’m not republican nor am I democrat.
However, if you want to distract from the fact that our current president is not one of the worst offenders with your long paragraphs about how “but the democrats too,” then that’s on you.
I wouldn’t have supported Bill either, but throw that nonsense at me like I give a fuck.
My point was one thing.
[removed]
Just going to report you instead of saying what I really want to say.
Your comments are getting more and more disgusting.
[removed]
If?
He was banned from a mall for flirting with high school girls there.
He requested parents permission to date teenagers in his 30s.
All of this is well documented.
Then he stands up and says they’re all lying, the whole town is fake news.
You’re being either intellectually dishonest or not doing your due diligence in researching your party’s top candidates.
I know, right?
Look at how the Dems held Clinton accountable and believed Flowers, Willie and Lewinski.
Don’t you remember Carville saying about Jennifer Flowers, “Drag a $100 bill through a through a trailer and you don’t know what you’re gonna find.” There is no moral high ground for Dems.
This is pure political maneuvering.
I can't believe we actually have people who think like him in the general population.
It's just sad more than anything honestly that somebody could have such little empathy and put "winning' over what's right.
Oh no, I'll readily admit to *despising* Hillary from the moment she stepped into the national spotlight (and yet I voted for Bill in '92).
And no, I'm not talking about those bizarre accusations of murder and whatever else...
I'm talking about her non-stop smearing of every accuser that ever came forward against Bill, and all the sketchy legal maneuverings she instigated against many of them.
*Those are matters of fact, not opinion.
*

Hillary is a skeevy fucking person down to her deepest core, plain and simple.
We would do much better by tossing them all out and starting over IMO... *all* of them.
Sorry, I didn't mean to be so explosive.
I have a personal history wrapped up in the way that people 'jokingly' refer to wiping out a segment of people and other such rhetoric, and I wanted to call that person out.
I never said that.
I said the accusations against *Bill* were far worse than those against Trump... and they are / were.
Well unfortunately I do not vote in that state but if I could I would vote not to have him there I don't follow every political news line unfortunately.
&gt;Yeah, that’s her.
With the gold.
I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her.
You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them.
It’s like a magnet.
Just kiss.
I don’t even wait.
And when you’re a star, they let you do it.
You can do anything.
Grab ’em by the pussy.
You can do anything.
The moment you entertained the thought of it.
...
I mean, I also don't like the Republican party.
But are you seriously suggesting that we forbid nearly a quarter of American citizens from being represented in government?
Lol thanks I consider that a compliment given your lack of a rebuttal.
[removed]
If “grab them by the pussy” doesn’t equal “I am ENCOURAGING sexual assault” then I don’t know what does.
Come on.
It has nothing to do with "Bill did it too", it's the fact that Hillary openly and brazenly participated in villafying the women that Bill assaulted.
Dude, you don’t follow special election senate races?
Senate seats are kind of a big deal?
An uninformed voter leads to a skewed democracy.
You should be ashamed.
Ah yes, I too only vote for politicians I know personally.
Unsubstantiated allegations do not equal guilt.
When did we lose the right to due process in this country?
I could claim you sexually assaulted me just as easily as the examples you gave.
[deleted]
[removed]
You said you're a Republican.
And it's "who" you voted for not "whom".
I think Trump and Bill’s accusations are about equally awful.
Given the laundry list each of them have tacked to the inside of their closet door, we could probably spend a lot of time debating that... neither is even vaguely close to being a good human being, that's for certain!
So no use arguing with you.
Since you can only get facts from the person who did it and they deny it so you believe them flat out.
He took part in an inappropriate picture where he appeared to be groping Leanne Tweeden while she was asleep, he wasn't actually touching her and then he proposed she give him a kiss during a comedy skit at a USO show.
Didn't actually assault anyone, whip his dick out and beat off in front of them, drug anyone, and was very obviously contrite reflecting on his behaviour in hindsight... but he's blackballed while the President is on tape admitting to groping women.
Facts and common sense standards are not relevant anymore, just riling up the mob to demand action or resignation.
What?
So, saying “grab them by the pussy” is sexual assault?
Who exactly is the victim here?
I need to inform everyone reading this that Lincoln would not have been in the modern Republican party.
Easy mistake unless you really know your American history.

DAE both sides?
/s.
It makes you sound like a person operating in bad faith on the internet.
Comments like that absolutely set off most people's "Russian troll" alarms.
Without government funding to protect socially liberal policies, they don't exist.
Libertarianism is a front for selfish people who pretend their actions don't or shouldn't have consequences.
[deleted]
It's like he got a consensual blowjob and didn't rape his own wife.
Oh wow, I didn't even know there were people so stupid as to be incapable of entertaining ideas they don't agree with or even mere fantasies...
Libertarians also don’t believe in taxes, which is how our government functions.
Whether people like to admit this or not, the US would not be a world power without regulatory oversight and a central authority.
No but raping your ex wife is.
