Hey everybody, I'm new here.
I've really recently been trying to have a living Dex in Ultra Moon, and I'm practically successful, but all I really need is a Hoopa!
Can anybody here help me out?
I got a bunch of shinies to trade if anyone's interested.
Thanks!
Edit: got my Hoopa!
Big thank you to jswizzl for the trade!
I have a few McDonalds Hoopas.

Either Hasty or Modest nature.
I self-obtained them directly from the event in Alpha Sapphire and reset the file for multiples.
Since it's an event I would want a 2:1 trade.
I'm interested in the shiny Cacturne and Nuzleaf.
That's fine by me!
I'll add you right now.
Awesome, do you have a preference for nature?
Not at all, whichever works best for you is fine.
Also, your FC doesn't seem to be adding.
It says it's invalid...
Oh I'm sorry!
It's 4639, not 4369.
I'll fix that in my flair right way.
Excellent, I'll be online very soon!
Okay!
I'm in Festival Plaza right now, so just send me a request as soon as you're there!
Thank you for the trade!
Thank you too!
Have a good rest of your night :)
