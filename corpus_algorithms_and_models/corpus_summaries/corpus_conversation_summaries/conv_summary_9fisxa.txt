I didnt know what this meant, untill after he got popped for tren, which I knew was like, a fuckin farm animal roid, but then everyone just kept posting VAI CAVALO this n that so I finally looked it up.
Does it mean cow or something?

Vai cavalo is like workhorse or some shit, and i think they give it to ponies as well.

It would basically make recovery impossible when it comes to MMA training.
