Original Response: 
**My short bio:** While embedded with US forces in eastern Afghanistan, journalist Carmen Gentile suffered one of the most unusual injuries in the annals of modern warfare when he was struck in the side of the head with a rocket-propelled grenade, shattering bones in his face and blinding him in one eye.
His new book "Blindsided by the Taliban" is a dark-humored, self-deprecating account of his injury and effort to overcome his physical and psychological wounds.

So why didn't the RPG explode?
Those that know better than I have theorized that it was either a dud, had not traveled far enough to detonate or perhaps was not properly armed before being fired.
An MRAP in that same area the day before took an RPG to the engine block and had to be towed back to the combat outpost.
I'd like to think that by the transitive property my head is stronger than the armored plating on an MRAP but we all know that's the musings of a delusional idiot.
Let's say it was dumb luck.
Yeah, I'll go with that.
Thanks for asking.
C.
I think it was just a faulty rocket.
You're probably right, though part of me still like to think it was attributable to my mutant healing powers.
Does your friends and family make puns about you being really hard headed and stuff like that.
Hey I saw you on /r/combatfootage earlier!
My money is still on the nose cap not being removed.
They'd been saying that for decades prior to my being shot in the head.
That incident only confirmed their assertions.
That's probably a good guess.
You know, one of these guys, I'm going to have to perhaps do a story looking at the attack from a purely clinical perspective.
I could consult weapons experts, soldiers, veterans, others that have been hit by RPG, etc.
I could title it: "How the hell am I still here?"
Think that would work?
That's a good guess.
Maybe an weapons expert should examine the dent in the side of my face and see if there are any nose cap serial number tattooed on there.
You already replied to this one, bud!
For the record, "How the Hell am I Still Here" would be an amusing title for that investigation.
Ugh.
I'm a reddit dum-dum.
I just started using it a couple of days ago.
"Lord help me, I'm just not that bright."

See you can blame it on an RPG to the dome though, the rest of us have to make do with being posted to /r/OopsDidntMeanTo.

Summary: 
I think it was just a faulty rocket.
That's probably a good guess.
I could title it: "How the hell am I still here?"
Hey I saw you on /r/combatfootage earlier!
