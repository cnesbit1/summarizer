Original Response: 
Does anyone here drive for Lyft?
Was considering applying as a side gig but would like to here what itâ€™s like from someone who drives in town first.
I used lyft a whole ago, but I have no idea about bring a driver itself.
But grub is really popular here.
if you live in the middle of town and work from home then its good, otherwise there is a lot of down time between rides because there are more drivers then riders in corpus.
I have a friend who is a Lyft driver in Corpus and she really likes it.
I drive Lyft &amp; Ubert part-time.
There are way too many drivers these days, so getting enough rides to make it worth your while is tough.
But if you're insistent on signing up, use my referral links please:[http://lyft.com/drivers/JASON7044](http://lyft.com/drivers/JASON7044)[https://partners.uber.com/i/hu4ejddw5](https://partners.uber.com/i/hu4ejddw5)
