Original Response: 
They burned unsold things rather than selling it in low price.
It was the right move.
They‚Äôve had to work hard to shake the chav association that happened a decade or so ago.
Total brand killer.
It's because they don't want their brand associated with lower income people.
They want it to remain exclusive to people who can afford it at sticker price.
They literally burn tens of millions worth every year.
What does chav mean?
Lower class English.
Basically English white trash (for lack of a better term, no judgement being passed here).
They were obsessed with wearing fake designer shit and it watered down brands like LV and Burberry.
Imagine all those fake purses and shit they sell in the streets of NYC.
It hurt Burberry‚Äôs ‚Äúexclusivity‚Äù image.
i like the point, they are still standing their ground and their reputation.
They could simply produce less of it and make higher profits.
It's common with high end brands.
It's why Louis Vuitton, coach, etc was expensive for so long.
Now it's everywhere.
They are protecting their brand and the niche it holds.
So how does Burberry destroying extra products stop chavs from buying fake ones?
Then they wouldn't be the brand that burns millions on merchandise.
**C**ouncil **H**oused **A**nd **V**iolent.
Because selling them at a discounted price would perpetuate the issue of lower income "chavs" buying it, wearing it, and soiling the image of their 'prestigious' brand.
They stop the chavs from buying both discount and fake, so just left with the fake which are at least discernible up close.
Same tactics sort of that Herm√®s pulls with their burkin bags and other products.
Council housed and violent.
Fashion is a high risk industry, especially for the designers.
It's hard to predict demand for a new design/style product.
That's why the fast fashion chains like Express can sell for much cheaper.
They are building on successes of high fashion, reducing risk and increasing volume, which ultimately drives a lower price point.
If Burberry, or other designers, don't have stock available for their items, they won't be able to capitalize on the successful items.
If they produce less quantity of all items, they will have to raise prices, which affects demand and pushes them out of certain demographics that may be their key market.
That is definitely not been shaken.
Too bad it is associated with chavs anyway.
the merchandise itself is worth pennies in materials and labor, the only value is in the brand, and the brand cheapens if you find their products on bargain shelves.
I worked for a company that would sometimes needs to dispose of 10s of thousands of cloths.
You would be surprised at how hard it is to find a charity that can accept that kind of a donation.
They'd work hard to donate everything, but they couldn't always find someone that would accept the donation.
So they did throw them away sometimes.
These were unbranded bulk clothing.
like 10,000 green polos.
Burberry, i'm sure is also concerned with protecting their brands image.
My client didn't that that concern.
But donating at a large scale is hard.
FWIW.
The rich buy anything and live lavishly so they wear what they want, the middle class buys out of season stuff on sale, and the cheaper products which mimic the trend setting rich lines.
Ultimately in their head they don‚Äôt want to be associated with poor people.
The poor buy whatever they can which is ultimately the middle classes hand me downs, extremely cheap knock offs, clearance racks in big box stores.
So ultimately the riches taste in fashion trickles down.
Fashion brands don‚Äôt want to be associated even with the middle class because that‚Äôs left overs, the rich want the newest exclusive stuff money can buy as long as they are the only ones and feel elite.
Since fashion will and has always functioned that way the only way to keep your margins from shrinking and rich people from becoming disinterested you have to burn the shit so poor people aren‚Äôt associated with your brand.
If you are an exclusive brand and a rich person hears about how some poor people wear your even 20 year outdated products on the reg that‚Äôs like a death sentence to that form of the company.
Fashion comparatively to other industries is deeply driven by the upper classes tastes and wants, and just made up by the belief of its value like currency, it leads to understanding why trickle down economics can‚Äôt work imo.
If your solution to not feeling exclusive enough is burning products that can help people that are just making ends meet, or mimicking your old style, or even make someone who needs warmth warm.
Just because you want that feeling so bad.
That shows a 100% guarantee that the ultra rich would just horde money so they feel more exclusive and exceptional in their elite club.
or maybe they distribute it to homeless people but burning it?
I don't think its a good idea.
Exactly!
they are not practical.
Agreed to this point!
Because they don't want to degrade their brand

&amp;#x200B;
I bet their brand is going to tank.
There‚Äôs no way people buy their streetwear garb after their rich clientele see ‚Äúcommoners‚Äù wearing it.
[Like this hoodie](https://www.neimanmarcus.com/p/burberry-mens-harrington-graphic-print-hoodie-prod211060136?childItemId=NMN5F54_&amp;navpath=cat000000_cat000730_cat000227_cat57030762&amp;page=0&amp;position=68&amp;uuid=PDP_PAGINATION_42dfdcb73b1cbe4b291ede6ad91ec239_oORsCUd6fy8zRUhzY5CJ06RW).
The print was meh.
But what the hell is that price?
All their shit is ridiculously over priced for what you get.
$240 for a T-shirt.
$1,128 for a backpack.
$580 for sneakers.
It was reported earlier this year that they burned their merchandise with a total worth of $36 million.
I would guess the true cost of it was probably at around $3 to $4 million top.
Tbh, probably only a few hundred thousand bucks.
A $240 T-shirt probably costs $5 to make.
And that‚Äôs generous considering that regular T-shirts cost less than $1 to make.
Hopefully the more labor intensive products (like leather jackets and handbags) are made in low enough quantities that they sell out.
$240 for a t-shirt isn‚Äôt that bad, Versace t-shirts are $700.
&gt; All their shit is ridiculously over priced for what you get.$240 for a T-shirt.
It's exactly priced for what you got.
You get to show to the world that you can afford $240 t-shirts.
It is still bad.
I can get long staple cashmere for cheaper.
Exactly, which is why their new idea of ‚Äúnot destroying clothes‚Äù is going to hurt their brand and their ability to charge $240 for a T-shirt.
Because the people who pay $240 don‚Äôt want to be associated with the ones who got it on sale for $60 (or less).
That‚Äôs the rough price of Burberry when it‚Äôs not fake or discounted.
This is a business sub, why not just look at the data rather than regurgitating teenage angsty rhetoric about meanie head corporations?
Burberry Group plc operates at ~69% profit margin prior to administrative costs.
The most basic assumption for the 34M inventory burned would be a cost of 11M, meaning the original poster is probably more accurate and your assumptions are incorrect.
Okay, you‚Äôre right.
Also I‚Äôm Not anti-capitalist, but I sure don‚Äôt like bad design that is expensive.
Basically veblen goods.
My rhetoric wasn‚Äôt necessarily directed at you, but rather the redditification of what is supposed to be a business sub.
It‚Äôs basically the same 17 year olds posting from r/politics but with articles mildly touching on business.
No worries, I agree with you anywaysüòÑ.
Cheers!üéâ.
