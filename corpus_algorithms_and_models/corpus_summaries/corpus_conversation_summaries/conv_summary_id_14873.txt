OP loving that repost karma?
Repost?
I check the last 30days submissions for this and every pic I post to this sub.
If you can kindly point to the post in question I will be happy to remove it.
If you want to just not respond we can leave it.
If you want me to go through the trouble of proving you wrong I can.

Please show me where this pic was posted here with in the last 30days.
