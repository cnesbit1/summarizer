Original Response: 
This happened a few months ago, but I still think about it every time I walk by.
I went to Walgreen's to buy Plan B with my boyfriend.
The lady at the register grabbed some scissors and offered to open it for me right there so that I could take it with my water bottle.
The Walgreens is in a pretty rough part of town, so I wonder if she has seen girls come in, in much more dire situations.
I am fortunate my circumstance in that moment was low-pressure, healthy, with my boyfriend at my side.
The simple action of her offering to open the package right there was simple but powerful.
Really put me even more at ease.
Anyways, I wanted to share it here, it seemed a good place for it.
Have a good day!

I remember once, when I was 20, a 17 year old co-worker of mine asked me to take her to CVS to buy plan B and between the 2 that we went to, they both told us they “wouldn’t have any for the next 72 hrs”.
Of course, that’s the time frame after which plan B becomes ineffective -__-.
Glad you had a better experience, though!

I'm not American but I have bought emergency contraception in both Canada and Europe and I'm wondering why this is such a grand gesture.
Please don't downvote me!
Genuinely want to understand the barriers in America.

For the first ten years after it's approval, it required a script if you were 17 or under.
After a court ruling, it became otc (over the counter, no script needed for anyone) about ten years ago.
The EV movement tries to make it very difficult to obtain, and there are laws that allow pharmacists to refuse it if they "have religious objections".
Sometimes women have to go to several pharmacies to buy it because, despite the term 'over the counter', it's actually stored behind the counter so the pharmacist can have a little power trip and judge you.
