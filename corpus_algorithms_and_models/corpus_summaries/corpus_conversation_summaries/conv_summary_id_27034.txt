I really like that dress.
I felt the same way about the dress she wore at the end of [last week's episode of GoT](http://i.imgur.com/m7OqDkk.jpg)

It makes sense, as far as she knows everyone she's ever known and loved is dead as a doornail due to varying degrees of monstrosity.
She hasn't had many positive influences for a few seasons now.

4 episodes behind:(
I interpret as more she's grown up instead of her turning bad or any thing.
She started off as a very naive girl who slowly starting growing up a bit more as the show went on.
Then when Belish she finally figured out how the game is played.
We saw that when she lied with that looks she gives him.
This signifies her transformation naive little girl to what ever she's about to become.
I wasn't sure I was going to be able to pick my jaw back up off the floor when I first saw the photos of Sophie Turner from this event.
She's absolutely, stunningly gorgeous.
I told you what episode it was from.
Yeah I know I'm not accusing you of spoiling.
I'm just sad cuz I'm 4 episodes behind.

Summary: 
I told you what episode it was from.
I really like that dress.
