Hey, guys!
We've had a female calico cat showing up (because we've been feeding her) who isn't native to our stray population here in the Doddridge/Staples area.
If you have lost a cat and think she may be yours, please PM/comment with a detailed description/photo and I will snag her when she returns for her next meal so that she can be returned home.
I know of a girl that has 5 cats that lives in the area... probably not her though.
I know someone that JUST a lost a similar cat?
Can you attach a picture?Edit: I'll PM you info.
