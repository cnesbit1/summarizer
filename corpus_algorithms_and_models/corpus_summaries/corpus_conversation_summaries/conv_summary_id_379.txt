Original Response: 
My pregnant wife is desperate for a feta burger and is insisting that I don't have to make it.
Where can we go in town that has a feta burger?
Looks like Eirinis Gyros &amp; More has one.
I tried googling feta burger corpus Christi and came up with that as well.
I don't think their burger quality will be that great.
Has anyone had a burger from here before?
The food is really good from there.
Wife says: we'll find it.
[We did it!

Bull Chicks  has them I think.
If this is a recurring craving, Ginger Cafe has a lamb burger with feta as well.
I haven't tried the burger, but their food is quite good.
Hmm.... Ginger cafe is great.
I never thought about asking for a burger.
They have the best burgers in town in my opinion; best gyros too.
My gf and I are addicted to their Gyros.
They definitely have a Greek Burger on the menu that has Feta and Spinach, been wanting to try it.
Well, I'm sure the wife and I will end up there this weekend.
I'll have to remember to report back.
