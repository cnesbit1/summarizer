Original Response: 
At least it's 5.56.
9mm, .45acp or 7.62 and you might have a problem.
Care to explain?
Those are typical munition calibres that both the SAF and SPF use.
Depends on what kind of 7.62.
7.62x39(AKM/SKS) means possible terrorism.
9mm and .45acp are pistol calibers.
Pistols are easier to conceal, and therefore easier to smuggle.
It's unlikely it's from a patrolling officer since we use .38.
We have some 9mm handguns, but the .38 Taurus isn't phased out (completely) yet.
EDIT: A word.
What if 203mm.
Then we're attacking Malaysia.
Honestly thought this was a reference to pubg.
lol how come explain pls.
203mm is probably artillery shell.
20.3cm across so I'm sure you can imagine.
It is a shell iirc.
while 203mm is an artillery shell, the Singapore Artillery doesn't have a weapon system that fires 203mm shells.
At most 155m.
Now if it was a 227mm rocket...then yes, that's our HIMARS.
Gpmg uses 7.62 tho so it might not be an akm.
Our snipers and gpmg uses the nato 7.62x51 while the 7.62 x 39 are mostly used by AKs and AKM.
That's 7.62 NATO.
Ah my bad, you learn something new everyday ðŸ˜‚.
It's understandable, most people are confused by it.

Summary: 
It is a shell iirc.
203mm is probably artillery shell.
Depends on what kind of 7.62.
