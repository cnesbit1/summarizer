Original Response: 
Hello all!
My boyfriend and I were just having sex when he said “Why don’t we try it without the vibrator?”  At first I said ok but when I started to feel close to climaxing I tried to grab it and I noticed he looked displeased.
I then explained to him that the media and porn make it seem like you should be able to make me cum without a vibrator and that he shouldn’t feel bad that I use one.
He apologized and said he knew that to be true but still felt bad.
I reassured him and we had amazing sex as usual.
However, I would love for people to leave comments so I can show him this later!
All comments welcome and thank you in advance!
TL;DR: my boyfriend feels bad that I need to use a vibrator during sex to cum.
Leave a comment letting him know that it’s ok and that media/porn is wrong.
Edit: I’m fine with all comments.
I meant to take the last sentence in the tldr out.
Edit 2: I don’t just have sex and they swat my boyfriend away and use a vibrator.
I just add it in while we continue PIV sex.
These comments should be able to tell you who cant hit the g spot and who needs assisting lol.
You do understand that many woman can only cum from clitoral stimulation right?
No i dont hence my post.
If  they told you you made them cum without clitoral stimulation they lied and did you a disservice.
While there is an exception to the rule I know for a fact there is a existing “orgasm gap” because guys have this idea of how a woman is supposed to cum.
It’s the ones who take the time to understand how to truly pleasure a woman that win.
My boyfriend does this and, while he was feeling bad about it last night, I wrote this post in hopes that he will understand how common it is for woman to need clitoral stimulation and how uncommon it is for woman to cum exclusively through PIV.
So what would a man do 100 years ago?
Guess it was impossible to truly please a woman right?
I mean there is a long history of men not really caring about woman or their wants.
Maybe they weren’t truly pleasing them?
Maybe they would do oral?
[Either way here is an article of how vibrators have evolved over the last 100 years.
](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4776588/amp/How-sex-toys-evolved-past-100-years.html) Theyve always been a thing.
Edit: here is an article on the percentage of woman who cum with just intercourse alone.
HINT: 20%

20 FUCKING PERCENT.
Let’s flip it a bit and you TELL ME how you would feel if you ONLY came 20% of the time you had sex?
But just to reiterate, the stat above is how many woman cum from just PIV sex.

Men didn't give a shit

You could please women.
Start by listening to them.

I thought she meant she needed a vibrator not a long object.

Summary: 
I just add it in while we continue PIV sex.
I reassured him and we had amazing sex as usual.
Maybe they would do oral?
