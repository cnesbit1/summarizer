Original Response: 
r/The_GreatAwakening just banned.
Jesus Christ, this is insane..
its a witchhunt 

How long before they start banning users from the site because they have a view that is remotely to the right?
We must continue to speak out and condemn this witchunt.
Remotely to the right?
what's the next sub?
Differing from the Deep State would that be a better wording?
Reality would be preferred.
Reminder that as the left goes further left, the center becomes "the right".

The  storm after the awakening?
Apparantly you are a hater if you believe there are only two genders.
/r/conspiracyhub.
Who's reality?
Why ban something that is a LARP?
If a LARP it can do no harm right?
Banning them only proves that they have been right all along.
[deleted]
Yes, because telling someone to GTFO because they're being a shithead has always been a universal proof of being "right."
Oh shit.
That means the crackhead screaming about demons on the street corner the police arrested was right too.
&gt;If a LARP it can do no harm right?
I think it might have to do with the people following the LARP and what they say and do.
That can cause harm.
All the people from even slightly controversial subs need to know to go to [Voat](https://voat.co/v/conspiracy) immediately after the sub is inevitably banned.
The mods of banned subs have done a great disservice to their members by not having a back-up plan in place.
They were calling for public hangings over there.
Are you insinuating extrajudicial murders are a right wing ideal?
Why don’t you guys just use the Chans instead of having to worry about getting banned on Reddit?
Or do you enjoy the victimization?
Or Voat?
You say that as if it was just innocent opinions and discussions being shared on that subreddit.
If you could provide a source on that I would be happy to look at it.
I love how you lump me in with these groups though I dont agree with them.
Some of those subs are despicable

However I am big on not censoring anyone including people with extreme views whether that be on the left or the right.
Kinda tricky considering that trash has been taken out already.
Isnt everything archived?
I would be shocked to find that shit on the internet is not saved or archived somewhere.
Honestly, probably us because we swing at both repubs and dems here.
Lol now apparently q’s insane theories are just remotely right wing.
Lol.
It’s a crackpot conspiracy even for conspiracy theorists.
The state has not outlawed q larpers from running their own forums.
When impeachment comes q will likely call for revolt and reddit probably wanted to get ahead of that.
Even if you can find a link.
People defending that subreddit will say it was just others trolling to make it look bad.
It’s easy for them to deny it after they are the “victims” of the Reddit’s ban hammer.
Ah yes, we should hold our ground like the good old days.
We need to oppress women and minorities.
Oh yeah, Christianity is the only true religion, and marijuana is the Devil’s lettuce.
The irony here is that the Left on Reddit are huge on victimization and delusions of persecution.
They often accuse others of attacking them, and that Reddit is a right wing vehicle enabling these "fascists" to do so.
Do you want to hear something funny though?
I've never heard of TGA before seeing this post.
In fact, short of TD, I don't know of any other Alt-Right subs.
But I can easily name off five subreddits that lean hard left without breaking a sweat.
Oftentimes, these subs have content that either toes the line of Reddits rules of conduct, or outright violate those rules.
These subs still exist.
They havent been shut down or seriously looked at for violations, they keep chugging right along.
I think the gist of what u/mrsuns10 is saying is that there is a serious discrepancy in what Reddit decides to keep and what to ban.
The rules are not being applied fairly nor equally.
One doesn't even need to subscribe to a right leaning ideology, merely disagreeing with the narrative of the Left invites scorn, ridicule and brigading.
I imagine if the rules were adhered to and enforced without bias, we wouldn't be having this conversation now.
As it is, Reddit is well on its way to becoming an Alt-Left echo chamber with memes and puppy and kitten pictures for flavor.
Telling people to go elsewhere is just one symptom of this metamorphosis.
Yep because r/GreatAwakening was slightly on the Right spectrum lol.
Reddit is left leaning.
America is left leaning in general (although active voting is closer to 50-50).
This is a fact.
Just because there are 5 hard left threads does not mean they tread the same water and engage in the same behavior as MDE, KiA, T_D, GA, Cringe, etc.
Also, every post I ever check out on a right-wing sub has two to three comments with people bitching about downvotes or brigading.
I see just as many posts solely about downvoting and brigading.
This is self-victimization at it's absolute purest form on Reddit.
And don't sit and bitch about "scorn and ridicule".
If you have stupid ideas that you want to share on public forums, people are going to catch on and call you on them.
This is America.
If you believe in the sanctity of free speech and the right to share any opinion, face the fucking music when people aren't a fan of what you have to say.
Edited: Grammar.
What if he was?
Who defines a “shithead”?
Nice argument 

Edit: Usually I don’t care enough but took a look at your account...if your stance was the complete opposite, there would be 50 comments calling you Boris.
There are more than two?
This is fascism!
And why decentralized platforms are so important.
If you haven’t heard of the great awakening before today, I don’t think you’re in a position to generalize an entire political party’s identity on Reddit.
Give me a break.
That subreddit was spewing very dangerous lies.
Can't.
If you've ever commented there, it's gone from your history.
Convenient eh?
That's not relevant to the discussion.
If someone considers someone a shithead and throws them out, then that just means the person doing the ejecting thought they were being a shithead, and has absolutely nothing to do with the arguments.
E.g., I can walk into your home and call your mother a whore, and you telling me to GTFO has zero relevance as to whether or not your mother is a whore.
[removed]
Funny you mention that because I never commented on that sub.
What even is the deep state.
i did, i few times.
I guess it could be a figment of my imagination, as I can't really prove it anymore.
&gt;  But I can easily name off five subreddits that lean hard left without breaking a sweat.
Oftentimes, these subs have content that either toes the line of Reddits rules of conduct, or outright violate those rules.
These subs still exist.
They havent been shut down or seriously looked at for violations, they keep chugging right along.
Name them.
You won't.
Lol wtf.
Nice try dude.
Silly, they're the arbiter of truth.
Now relax while they purify every bit of information you take in.
Right and left is all bullshit.
Stop being a sheep.
Don't buy into that bullshit.
Being a fan of what you have to say and taking away the ability to say it are very different.
Lol.
But seriously, what if the people we think are completely bonkers are actually right?
r/nosleep.
I was cross banned from r/communism for making a point in r/latestagecapitalism.
The mod immediately called me a liar then muted me from there too.
Lol idgaf about being banned from a sub I don’t even frequent all I said is I never post in that sub.
These people suck, reddit is going down hill and has been since the mass migration to voat.
How where they dangerous?
Exactly?
What?
This is bullshit.
Its all archived outside reddit servers.
99.99% of it.
most likely he was, just misunderstood and can't properly convey what he is experiencing.
No one took the ability for someone to say anything.
Just because they can’t call for Hilary Clinton and Obama to be hung on Reddit, doesn’t mean they can’t say that on Voat or scream it at a Trump rally.
[deleted]
We got bamboozled when all the 9gaggers arrived with their feelings and victimization.
Remember when r/conspiracy used to be good?
Great documentaries on unsolved mysteries and questionable occurrences with governments.
Now we are arguing that the site itself is conspiring against its users... What a sad time.
If they ban this sub I’m just done with Reddit entirely.
May not even pay for internet if it’s going to be that Orwellian anyway.
Fucking soft ass people behind a keyboards ruining good dialogue cause it contradicts their worldview.
Freedom of speech is dying because of you fairies.
Do I need to draw you a picture?
Maybe some PHIL 1000 stuff for you?
And so are a lot of other subreddits, yet they don’t get banned for inciting violence.
The highly right leaning military-industrial complex.
&gt; America is left leaning in general (although active voting is closer to 50-50).
**This is a fact.

STOP.
RIGHT.
THERE.
You are lying.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/225074/conservative-lead-ideology-down-single-digits.aspx

35% conservative

35% moderate (in the middle)

25% liberal

Just because your echo chambers are left leaning doesn't mean the real world is.
Lol, ok.
If that's what you want to believe, all good by me.
Cheers friendo.
If you read the write up, you’ll see that the “Moderate” numbers trend closer to the left than the right.
50% of Democrats view themselves as Liberal, while 35% view themselves as Moderate and 13% view themselves as Conservative.
On the Republican side, 69% view themselves as Conservative, 25% view themselves as Moderate and 5% view themselves as Liberal.
So the Democratic Party holds a larger share of the Moderate voters, which would indicate a majority of Moderates are more left-leaning.
Most voters that do not identify with a political party will identify as Moderate out of a desire not to align with a political philosophy, this includes most non voters.
However if you look at the key political issues in America, a majority of Americans poll on the more liberal spectrum.
Liberal and Democratic positions on gay marriage, abortion, immigration, voting rights, banking regulation, affordable and universal healthcare, and more, all poll in the majority.
I’ll be happy to pull up recent examples of this tomorrow as I need to go to bed.

It's more like the handheld clacker balls.
They start in a neutral state pulled together by gravity in a downward position.
One is on the left, one is on the right.
As the hand moves they move farther apart until they meet back in a neutral state in an upward position and slam each other back down.
CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK 

They can only ever go as far as the other ball lets them.
CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK

They're still useless clacker balls that do nothing but make racket and get on everyone's nerves.

r/ politics calls for violence agaisnt the President on a daily basis.
Do you agree that they should be banned too?
Well you see, hillary and her buddies are actually running the country, but not enough to rig the electoral college despite rigging the popular vote.
Also they communicate through hand gestures on live TV and codewords in emails.

Have you ever been in a victim of a LARP?
Others are playing, they may or may not know that you are not a consenting participant.
It's a form of gang stalking I guess.
Probably the reason some people go crazy out of the blue.
No, you don't see it on All.
You know how many left leaning subs one can see on All.

That doesn't make any sense.
This is how free speech dies.
It will only escalate from here.
The two are leagues apart from the same thing.
Individual users can be banned from r/politics because of such comments.
Subreddits like The_GreatAwakening have mods and most of their users using to promote violence or let others post about inciting violence.
Funny, the mods at r/ politics must be asleep then.
Mods can claim to ban these types of comments, like they did on GA, but if the enforcement is non-existent, like on r/ politics, it amounts to the same thing.
https://i.imgur.com/6NRsGT0.jpg

This is just one thread, but it's a common occurrence over there.
You don’t seem to understand what I am saying.
Mods of r/ politics are letting others post about inciting violence on a near daily basis.
Yet, the sub is not banned?
Strange.

Could cause harm, sure.
But if you spent time reading Qanon followers you'd know they're a very patriotic and for the most part god-fearing group.
The Left has ginned up a negative profile of these people but it's very incorrect.
When I get a free moment, I'll find some stuff for you.
None of this is a direct threat, in the legal sense, which is important because if it were it wouldn't be protected speech.
Every cite you have is bloodlust at best.
From what I've seen the country is fully Republican on all 3 branches how is a Democrat running the country at all?
And why is it Hillary?
She's not very smart.
She conspired against their best chance at winning the election and then they did their best to support Donald trump our Twitter'r and chief win the primary and costed her self the election.
I really can't imagine why after her failure this deep state would still pick her as their ring leader.
Any power she may of held in this deep dark state was gone pretty much the moment she lost the election.
Is there someone else running the deep state now and are they just using Hillary as a front now?
I think they're getting you guys to go after the wrong target?
I was hoping the /s wouldnt be necessary but apparently it was.
Depressing really.
I did read them.
Y'all have to stop pretending that everything was sunshine and roses, we all looked at the sub and saw what was written.
Remind me when it does.
can’t wait to hear your show about this, john.
this timeline has been defying all my expectations since 2016.
Go ahead and post the links you are referencing.
Ironically you say that on r/conspiracy.
&gt; go to Voat

ok bye!
have fun with Voat’s post restrictions due to shitty servers.
maybe you can power the servers with memes idk.
yeah GA was pretty insane you’re correct.
And when VPN's become a problem, they will start banning accounts that use them...

We are really close to making Orwell proud.
I doubt I’ll have the “right” to do so at that time.
And I'll remind you when it doesn't, what do you want 1 week, 1 month?
Considering this in really about censoring opinions and not just people breaking the rules.
So you are saying we should be a sheep to another ideology?
&gt;this timeline has been defying all my expectations since 2016.
True dat.
No.
If it was people breaking the rules, why wouldn’t they ban those individual users?
I don’t believe any of that Q nonsense, but I did visit the subreddit recently out of curiosity.
Didn’t see anything that was breaking the rules.
Anyone can claim someone broke the rules, there isn’t any proof.
So they ban the entire subreddit because some people were *allegedly* breaking the rules?
You do realize that they aren’t going to just say “yeah we censored these people” they will come up with excuses and justifications that the average person won’t second guess or question.
So a post and one nasty reply?
Looks like some shill trying to get the sub banned to me.
Because mods weren't handling their subreddit to keep the people from making those kinds of comments.
Thats practically the whole reason TD is still around, because the mods actually worked with the admins to **moderate** their sub to reddit's rules (e.g.
TD users referring to /r/politics as redacted and other varients).
Just because you don't see anything breaking the rules doesn't mean they weren't; you could be of the opinion that the rules weren't being broken when they were or just not see it.
You do realize if they were censoring people for their opinions they'd be doing a whole fucking lot more than subs that are clearly promoting behavior that directly conflicts with reddit's rules of conduct?
edit: I responded with possible doxx material so if my reply gets deleted that's why and you'll have to make your own investigation.
They start with the smaller groups that the majority don’t like.
You do realize R/ conspiracy was on the list of things to be banned right?
They only took it off because that would be too obvious, they are saving it for another day when opinions and beliefs being silenced is “normal” there are archives of the subreddit somewhere, go see for yourself if you see any rule breaking.
To just take their word for it is ridiculous.
Where was this list?
Was it on some admin task list?
Or was it user based?
&gt;They only took it off because that would be too obvious

Or, let me ponder for a second, maybe this user list for targets is being moderated and subs that don't fit the agenda for banning hate speech are removed, like if someone put /r/CatsStandingUp was placed on the list?
&gt;go see for yourself if you see any rule breaking

Well I certainly don't want to be banned for supporting doxxing so its pretty hesitent to post links, but here you go:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SnapshillBotEx/comments/9a6emk/archives_for/

I checked two that were actual reddit threads and saw comments in both coordinating other accounts or doxxing methods like questioning merchandise sales.
While not required, you are requested to use the NP (No Participation) domain of reddit when crossposting.
This helps to protect both your account, and the accounts of other users, from administrative shadowbans.
The NP domain can be accessed by replacing the "www" in your reddit link with "np".
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/conspiracy) if you have any questions or concerns.
*
Yet there was no evidence for any actual doxxing.
If I suddenly want to start asking about doxxing around here, me, an individual user, should the entire subreddit and all affiliated subreddits be banned and wiped off reddit?
If you haven’t noticed the trend of increasing censorship and aren’t concerned about it, then I don’t know what to tell you.
Keep your head in the sand all you like, just don’t bitch and moan when you’re the one getting censored.
There is zero protected speech on a private website.
The law has literally nothing to do with anything involving Reddit's decisions.
&gt;Yet there was no evidence for any actual doxxing.
You clearly didn't look.
Because I saw multiple comments doing exactly that.
&gt;If I suddenly want to start asking about doxxing around here, me, an individual user, should the entire subreddit and all affiliated subreddits be banned and wiped off reddit?
If the mods refuse to enforce reddit's own rules, admins aren't going to do their job for them.
TD is still up because the mods agreed to work with the admins to control their subreddit breaking site-wide rules (e.g.
users not being allowed to mention /r/politics and instead using redacted/other variations).
And they have been consistent with this exact policy (see /r/srs from several years ago).
&gt;If you haven’t noticed the trend of increasing censorship and aren’t concerned about it, then I don’t know what to tell you.
I would be concerned if that trend didn't exactly correlate to a trend of increasing breaking of **explicit** site-wide rules.
Opinions aren't being censored, communities are.
&gt;Keep your head in the sand all you like

I literally just posted you proof of rules breaking by the sub in question and you're going to say this?
&gt;just don’t bitch and moan when you’re the one getting censored.
Or maybe its not unqualified to stop people from performing witch hunts?

The fallacy is that, with the advent of the internet, every idea is given equal footing, instead of relying on evidence and scientific method to determine what's true or not.
The crackhead has no evidence.
Reddit admins do have evidence that all the Qanon subs were full to the brim with hatred.
But only those seen as conservative?
Am I wrong in that assumption?
It's no coincidence that "conservative" is becoming synonymous with "hateful".
If you can find me a progressive sub that had the kinds of objectively offensive and hateful discussions like r/GreatAwakening, I'd be glad to report them.
I don’t really hang around political stuff here anymore, and after this I’ll probably unsub even news and just stay with entertainment only stuff.
If I had seen it I would.
However, outside of Reddit I’ve seen liberals hate and spew violent rhetoric as often or even more often than conservatives.
Well one difference, but this being my observations and opinions doesn’t mean it’s facts, is that conservatives say hateful things towards those in power and liberals say it to all.
Stuff like “lock Hillary up” vs “people that voted for Trump should be locked up.”

Edit: ugh.
Nope.
Tried looking in r/liberal and I can’t do it.
Too much blind hate towards anything Trump.
I am a republican, so I might be biased, but I can’t read anything like that.
Blind hate towards any political party fires me up.
&gt; I'll probably unsub even news 

Reality does have a liberal bias.
I read a lot of comments on reddit and talk politics to a lot of folks in the real world and I have never heard anyone say anything nearing "people that voted for Trump should be locked up."
Blind hatred is unreasoned hatred something or someone before encountering reason to harbor such resentment.
Trump has given more than enough reason to feel the way those people feel.
If you're a Republican, you should be ashamed about what's happening and what your party is doing to negatively affect our country.
If you're a Trumpublican, a follower of the disgraceful cult of personality, carry on.
I’ve seen a lot of threats towards anybody republican or voted for Trump.
Many many threats of violence and other things, but I have seen them go the other way.
So no side is innocent.
I get news from other sources and I don’t feel the need to discuss it.
Which even with liberal bias to many news sources, those that discuss it here push it even further left.
I just don’t need not want that anymore.
I am registered as republican because I want to vote in primaries and I mostly fall on the right.
I find it’s easier to say I’m a moderate republican than saying I’m some sort of independent.
I am very socially liberal.
I vote for gay rights, healthcare, stuff like that, but I also like small government and lower taxes and stuff.
I did vote for Trump in the general election and I find it’s dangerous to say that.
The left doesn’t care about anything else, I’m already a “deplorable” and nothing I say after is even heard.
I don’t have an emotional hang up with it.
If Trump is proven to have done bad things, I will be first in line to hold him accountable.
He seems to be doing a good job besides all the other stuff being said, and accusations aren’t proof.
They may or may not be true.
I didn’t vote for him in the primaries for what that’s worth, I wanted Ben Carson.
I just hate that people become so emotionally attached to politics.
Both sides.
I care less about who someone voted for than their shoe size and I’d like that people don’t care about it as well.
Anecdotes become evidence when they can be duplicated and reference multiple times.
Over 3000 people died in Puerto Rico as a result of a subpar response to a natural disaster.
Today, your president denied the US government data supporting the fact that it actually did happen, and chose to blame Democrats for making it up to reflect poorly on him.
No accusation there.
That's plain disgusting.
You can blame democrats for being emotional, but if that turn of events doesn't evoke some sort of emotion in you, you're complicit in contributing to the problem.
edit: link - http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/09/13/trump-ignites-firestorm-over-number-hurricane-related-deaths-in-puerto-rico.html.
He did everything he could do as far as I know.
I heard there were local problems with supplies not getting to where they were supposed to, you can’t blame the president for a hurricane.
And I do get upset about things he says and does, but nothing has been illegal or immoral.
Only accusations, and I don’t take accusations as evidence towards wrongdoing.
If accusations were guilt, all of our presidents and politicians would be in jail already.
The general idea is that there are two sexes, but multiple genders.
Gender, of course, being a societal construct.
I think it's weird that people care enough about this shit to be offended by it.
If you don't think it's immoral to deny the death of thousands of American citizens actually happened, then we're definitely done here.
I don’t think he denied people died, he was questioning the amount estimated.
Something I don’t agree with him on.
I don’t do that kind of work, so I don’t know how they find the numbers.
But it’s looking like you don’t want to talk anymore.
That’s fine, have a good day.
He doesn't do that kind of work either, so he doesn't know how they find the numbers either.
The people that actually ***do*** the work are the ones telling him the numbers.
They are the experts.
If we don't believe them, who do we believe?
If 3000 people died and Trump says "no, only 2999 people died," he's still denying that 1 death happened.
This is what I don't understand about how you can twist yourself into a pretzel in order to justify or assuage your decision to continue supporting this guy.
These are people, not just numbers.
Every American citizen that needlessly loses their life is a travesty.
Don't you agree?
One of the biggest points I tried to get across was that too many people just assign others to either be good or evil based on one fact.
All this turned out to be was that you painted me to be a trump apologist, which I am not.
Anybody losing their life is horrible.
I’ll just leave it at that.

Summary: 
I am very socially liberal.
I tell you this she will be  (x) out.
I don’t have an emotional hang up with it.
Something I don’t agree with him on.
If I had seen it I would.
I just don’t need not want that anymore.
Yet, the sub is not banned?
Wish I could find it.
Right and left is all bullshit.
- I want to see her publicly executed!
You don’t seem to understand what I am saying.
One is on the left, one is on the right.
i did, i few times.
Tried looking in r/liberal and I can’t do it.
If a LARP it can do no harm right?
Am I wrong in that assumption?
Funny you mention that because I never commented on that sub.
Banning them only proves that they have been right all along.
I think it might have to do with the people following the LARP and what they say and do.
These are people, not just numbers.
If they ban this sub I’m just done with Reddit entirely.
I just hate that people become so emotionally attached to politics.
I'm not saying I don't believe you but do you mind linking a few?
I doubt I’ll have the “right” to do so at that time.
If it was people breaking the rules, why wouldn’t they ban those individual users?
Do I need to draw you a picture?
Looks like some shill trying to get the sub banned to me.
Even if you can find a link.
If that's what you want to believe, all good by me.
No, you don't see it on All.
Didn’t see anything that was breaking the rules.
Do you agree that they should be banned too?
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
So they ban the entire subreddit because some people were *allegedly* breaking the rules?
He did everything he could do as far as I know.
Because I saw multiple comments doing exactly that.
I get news from other sources and I don’t feel the need to discuss it.
I was hoping the /s wouldnt be necessary but apparently it was.
The people that actually ***do*** the work are the ones telling him the numbers.
I don’t do that kind of work, so I don’t know how they find the numbers.
All this turned out to be was that you painted me to be a trump apologist, which I am not.
If we don't believe them, who do we believe?
I see just as many posts solely about downvoting and brigading.
Considering this in really about censoring opinions and not just people breaking the rules.
You know how many left leaning subs one can see on All.
I did vote for Trump in the general election and I find it’s dangerous to say that.
What even is the deep state.
Individual users can be banned from r/politics because of such comments.
If you could provide a source on that I would be happy to look at it.
I don’t think he denied people died, he was questioning the amount estimated.
The crackhead has no evidence.
I think they're getting you guys to go after the wrong target?
I was cross banned from r/communism for making a point in r/latestagecapitalism.
And why is it Hillary?
&gt;If a LARP it can do no harm right?
I am a republican, so I might be biased, but I can’t read anything like that.
And I do get upset about things he says and does, but nothing has been illegal or immoral.
I think it's weird that people care enough about this shit to be offended by it.
I love how you lump me in with these groups though I dont agree with them.
And so are a lot of other subreddits, yet they don’t get banned for inciting violence.
Why ban something that is a LARP?
In fact, short of TD, I don't know of any other Alt-Right subs.
When I get a free moment, I'll find some stuff for you.
It's a form of gang stalking I guess.
