Hey RedLiakos,

Could you tell me how you obtained the Rocky Lycan as this detail required by [Rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) of the sub.
Thanks!
There's no point now since the trade is off but ok.
I got it from u/RareBallHunterTroy in r/pokemonexchange and have photo proof.
You still need to provide the relevant details when offering and thanks!
