Original Response: 
I lost the key to my motorcycle while at Schlitterbahn and it's the only one within 800 miles.
Which locksmiths in town are good and fairly priced?
Try LockDoc on Airline near Alameda.
Thanks for that!
Everybody wants to charge over $100 for a new key to be made, even with the key code!
Are you a local?
Many years ago while working on the beach the owner of lockdoc told me he charges tourists more.
From the poor service I received I would believe it.
I took my business to Discount Locksmith.
My wife and I recently moved here and are enjoying it!
I'm just waiting for a meet up to get to know y'all better.
