“Khabib’s martial art explained” so we just all gonna forget about the Russian champion who raised us huh?

This article isn't for people who know who Fedor is, it's for the influx of casual fans looking to read about Conor's newest opponent.
Taktarov bless.
Is it really?
I'm about to open it, but I never thought of the technical side of things like this as casual.
Fedor wasn't the first and khabibs streak is almost as long, hes also light years more relevant atm.
The article talks about Fedor a good amount, if you actually read it.
OP just changed the title.
As a fan of anything there is not a switch from going from a casual fan to hardcore fan, its a transition that takes time.
This article is written for casuals that want to get to know the sport better and transition into a regular fan.
Lol

If I say I'm going to my class it doesn't mean I invented or own the classroom.
For real.
Sambo has had strong representation in MMA since the beginning.
Khabib has beat 3 top level opponents, when Fedor was 30-0 he had beat atleast 15 top 10 guys, it is laughable to suggest they are the same.
Cannot compare Khabib to a guy that was p4p no 1 for 7 straight yrs.
Is normal.
Well Fedor was never 30-0, he lost in like 99 or 2000 to a bullshit cut in RINGS.
But yeah he fought a lot more high level opponents during his crazy PRIDE run.
I don't consider that a loss and nobody else did.
And you know if kalabeeb saw this argument he'd slap us all.
Loved him in Bad Boys 2 and Predators.
Yeah no doubt, I was just being pedantic for people who might not have known about that, I don’t consider it a loss either boss that’s why I called it a bullshit cut.
Sir, please have an upvote for the sheer brilliance of your comment.

Summary: 
I don't consider that a loss and nobody else did.
