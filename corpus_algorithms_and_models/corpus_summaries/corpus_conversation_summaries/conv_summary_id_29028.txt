Original Response: 
CW always choose beautiful women for their shows.
My favorite part is how she turns to a brunette when she takes her clothes off.
I'm just happy she did that scene before becoming really famous with Supergirl.
Yes..only if marvel's Netflix shows did the same.
But...
They do?
Nice.
She also had tons of leaks before she got on super girl.
I saw them Nd was like who is this?
Saw super girl Nd didn’t connect the dots.
Few months later saw this homelands scene Nd made the connection.
Go on, downvote me for giving my opinion.
Not gonna delete it, I've got karma to spare.
I prefer super/superb as opposed to on/off.
Why do you keep saying "Nd" instead of "and"?
Just a texting habit I’ve kept since I was young.

Summary: 
I saw them Nd was like who is this?
