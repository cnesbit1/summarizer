&amp;most of the people I know working for the city are rather miserable.
The county isn't much better.
That being said, they do have a somewhat decent retirement plan w/ TMRS.
They do have a health &amp; wellness clinic that is open to city employees w/ no copay.
They used to have a gym in City Hall, I think, but I'm not sure if they do any longer.
What department were you looking at?
Pay increases are hard to come by.
The only way to obtain increases is to keep transferring to other departments.
A lot of upper management is derived from employees that have been with the city for decades, so they are set in their ways.
As an outsider, it'll be hard to make any positive changes without meeting friction from other staff members.
It was a very negative environment and I am glad I work in the private sector now.
