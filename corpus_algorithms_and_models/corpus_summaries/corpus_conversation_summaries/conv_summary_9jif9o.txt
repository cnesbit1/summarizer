Sure that's your dad?
Dude looks like he's still in his late 30s.
Congrats on the good genes.
Well, that’s because he is in his late 30’s!
Lol!
man.
i feel old right now.
(late 30's with a 14 month old and one on the way).
that said, he's looking dapper as fuck.. good on him.
He's late 30's with an 18 year old (yours truly), and I have a few younger siblings!
Congrats on the new one, and good luck along the way!
I think he will appreciate the comments when he sees these later!
Thanks!
so why aren't you right there with him?
riding is a family sport.
I am actually getting my motorcycle license next week!
Then we will be riding together all the time.
very nice to hear.
enjoy the hell out of it and stay safe.
I was 21 when I started to ride, dad was 42 as I recall, but that makes sense when pops had kids early.
It's weird to think my dad as a well-established adult, with an adult kid, was only a few years older than me really, but that's how it is.
It really does put it into a new perspective!

Nope.
I said he was late 30’s.
Wowwwww get off reddit I already deleted it that was a 5 second response dude.
Make sure to get some dirtbikes too!
Don’t feel old, my dad was about 38 when I was born (I’m now 20) and my sister when he was 40, you’ve still got plenty of time :)
Oh yah, i’m not killing myself or anything.
Just had a moment.

Summary: 
I said he was late 30’s.
i feel old right now.
Congrats on the good genes.
Well, that’s because he is in his late 30’s!
