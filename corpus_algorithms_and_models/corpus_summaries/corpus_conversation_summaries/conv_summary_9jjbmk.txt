I'm looking at all these comments and really sighing ... Americans just are like this aren't they.
I think you're within rights to be mad.
I mean I'm going to make a guess that the food he made just fucking sucked, and was about as relevant to Ethiopian food as panda express is to Chinese food, but you know, without the MSG to help you choke it down.
To be honest, yeah it does sound like a disappointing birthday, and the food DOES sound insulting, I don't think you're crazy for being insulted either.
I'll say I think a kind of cultural thing with americans is that the 'results' don't matter, only the thought counts, that's why everyones mad at you for not praising his dog shit food - because they think effort is all that counts.
Also, they are american, they have probably never tasted actually good food.
/s goes here but I'm not kidding really ;p

I don't think you're being ungrateful either.
I don't think grown men for the most part are so dumb they need to be given explicit instructions like "I want to go to a fancy restaurant for my birthday" - instead he should have been paying attention to your likes and dislikes, you said it yourself you spelled your love languages out to him loud and clear.
I mean... it just sounds like he didn't pay attention to what you like as a person at all and just boiled it down to - "Oh she is Ethiopian, I can score good boy points by focusing on that" 

Basically, I don't think you're in the wrong, or ungrateful, and your boyfriend sounds a bit socially daft.
Is there a delicate way of bring up your disappointment?
Not really.
Is it important to outline your attitude on this sort of thing for the long term survival of your relationship?
I think it is.
I can't tell you how to navigate that but basically, I feel like if you don't nip this in the bud every special occasion will turn into plates of crap being trot out as 'Ethiopian food' in place of actually well thought gifts or other acts of service that are actually mindful and considerate.
Just my two cents.
Also, Happy birthday, sorry it was a bad day, but hopefully the coming year brings you everything you want out of it.
WOW!
Ok, someone who understands my sentiment exactly - it's like you read in between the lines.
Yes, exactly I really think he thought he was scoring major points by just doing something Ethiopian instead of thinking, "ok, but will this be something she likes?"
Thank you for your wishes and thank you for my understanding how disgraceful this experience can be.
Americans just don't understand sometimes...lol.
Yes and they get really mad when they're told they don't understand instead of trying to educate or better themselves too lol!
I'm going to be honest with you, lot's of thinly veiled racism in this thread (like someone calling you a raised victim, wtf?)
I would honestly stick to asking your family and friends for advice, people on reddit can be, well, a bit like people who spend all their time behind a keyboard and not getting enough fresh air.
They're acting like you're being mean to your BF when you're just disappointed lol.... since when is that a crime.
Hopefully you can maybe talk to bf about this and resolve it in a productive manner!
Wowww yes!
Racism - overt, and subtle for sure.
Lol the thing that cracks me up is I really am understanding my BF more now since posting this.
He loves reddit.
I always tell him people on reddit are not real (obvi I know y'all are) but I encourage him to talk to actual people about things too because people are BOLD when they are anonymous.
Yes lol very bold.
Reddit is only good as long as you realise it's like... not real life.
It's an exaggeration.
I think a lot of young guys (and hey some girls) sometimes don't have the life experience to see that everything's like, exaggerated or stuff people would never say irl.
That said, your bf is probably ok, but if all he does to interact with the world is reddit then... yeah I can see why he thought his idea was 'thoughtful'.
Actually thinking about it the 'Ethiopian Feast' sounds like an idea someone on reddit would suggest to him haha.
I bet he did lol.
Thanks for being a voice of reason here.
