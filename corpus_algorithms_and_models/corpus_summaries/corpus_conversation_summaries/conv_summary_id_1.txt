Original Response: 
I've been highly considering moving to Corpus soon, and I really need some help from people my age (21).
Is this a decent place to live?
Am I going to be robbed as soon as I get there?
I ask because the crime rate is apparently one of the highest in Texas.
Please tell me where to go and where to avoid.
Any help is appreciated.
Just stay out of the west and north parts of the city and you'll be fine.
I haven't had any problems with crime.
It's a pretty laid back place to live, don't expect too many attractions, most of the recreations are outdoors (beach, fishing, etc.
).
You'll probably survive.
The very end of Staples that leads to downtown is definitely the worst place to be in the city!
South side is beautiful and ocean drive area is generally safe as well.

Summary: 
I haven't had any problems with crime.
