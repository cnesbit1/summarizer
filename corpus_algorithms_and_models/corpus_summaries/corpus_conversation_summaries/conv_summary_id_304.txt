Original Response: 
Do you or anyone you know have an 3D printer they are willing to help print things with?
Filament provided, just need access.
San Antonio has the public workshop things that has 3d printers, computers and such.
I forgot what they're called.
Post on Facebook for Southside, most likely to find one there.
10 bit works.
Yeah I used to go there.
Thanks for the info!
I've got one if needed and live on the southside.
Nice!
I work on the Southside!
What kind of files can you read and what kind of filament are you able to use?
Would like to work out a deal.
I've got a Robo r1+.
I can do abs or pla and a few others.
I only do pla right now but can switch to abs if you need.
I generally print stl files but can do a few others I can't think of off the top of my head.
That's rad!
