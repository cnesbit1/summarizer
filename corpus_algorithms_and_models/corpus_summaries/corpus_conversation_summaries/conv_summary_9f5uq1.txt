Original Response: 
Labelling it the "other" opioid epidemic is kind of disingenuous.
Its literally once of the main gateways to shooting heroin... What do you think they do when they cant get scrips any more.
It is, very objectively, not a main gateway to shooting heroin

As the article points out, as does the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, the rate of abuse among those with opioid prescriptions is less than 5% and the rate of addiction is between 0-3%

Of the many *millions* of people who have an opioid prescription in Canada, virtually none will ever ~~shoot heroin~~ become addicted and use illicit drugs.
The rate of addiction is significantly higher than 0-3% - that statistic comes from opioid-manufacturer-funded talks in the 80s.
Recent studies show a rate of 10-30%.

No, it doesn't, it comes from CAMH, CCSA, Health Canada, and our own Senate report on opioid addiction 

It also comes from over thirty years of study on heroin addiction, reaching back to the Vietnam War

fuck...lol.
Really gonna need a source on that.
30% is nothing short of hysterical lunacy.
I know anecdote != data, but in my experience very few methadone patients are normal folk who got addicted to legitimately prescribed painkillers.
The *vast* majority have never had an opioid prescription in their lives except for methadone.
Their route to addiction was entirely through recreational use, almost always in conjunction with crystal meth.
The public has this notion that a significant number of legitimate opioid users become addicted and it's simply not true.
Interestingly, medical practitioners form a large proportion of the small "normal folk" segment of methadone patients.
Partly because they had easy access to the drugs, but a depressing number turned to them as a way to deal with the crushing stress of medical residency.
You know you dont need to use a needle to get off on heroin.
can't tell if sarcastic?
Sorry forgot a suffix and deleted a word.
I was just being retarded.
You can substitute any other opioid or route of administration if you like, they're all equally untrue.
What do you mean untrue?
Like it doesn't exist or that it's illogical?
Whether or not people inject heroin, drink methadone, snort hydromorphone, or smoke opium the truth is that it is incredibly unlikely their addiction began with a legitimate prescription.
It happens a lot.
They got you your link.
No, it very obviously doesn't, and we have literally decades of studies from here and around the world that clearly and empirically proves that - you can't just make a claim like that with nothing but your own bullshit to back it up

Fuck me, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here!
No, they didn't, and the upvotes they're getting for such a wild and unsourced claim is mind boggling.
It is unlikely if they got a script for 7-14 days after a dental or sinus surgery.
Now if they have Chronic back pain or migraines or joint pain from an injury they might get scripts to manage the pain on a continual basis.
Over time they need high dosage with tolerance.
Eventually the doctor will not raise the dose and maybe he retires or something and they are daily opioide users taking high doses with legitimate pain.
If you look at the actual amount of opiods used by prescription by gram of morphine 90% of user with a script use 10^ of the opioids and 10% of the chronically injured, sick, dying use 90% of the opioids.
The long term rate of morphine addiction remains constant surprisingly for around a century at 0.7-1 % of the population at any one time.
It did not vary all that much in North America even post vietnam.
Last decade that rate of addiction is double, triple, even more than that in many places.
You are.
