Original Response: 
To start, I love sex!
I'm very comfortable with my sexuality and I enjoy it with long-term partners or more casually.
However, recently I've become somewhat uncomfortable with the power dynamics of it.
It makes me wary that men are taught from a young age to both desire women and to disrespect them, and when I look at porn I can't help but notice the linguistics of the titles (5 guys *destroy* teen slut, man *ruins* 18-year old, etc).
I feel like the negative cultural messages men are given about women (especially pertaining to sex) must sink in, and it's only a question of degree.
I sometimes end up wondering if a guy I'm sleeping with harbors contempt for my gender, and it can take me out of it.
Separately, the actual mechanics of sex that involve a man inserting a penis into a woman -- I love the feeling of this, but sometimes feel as though this is an act being done *to* me, that I/women are essentially objects while men are the active subjects.
Does anyone ever feel like this?
Am I crazy?
Do you always feel like sex is an act that you are equally sharing with another person?
If not, does that ever bother you or do you accept it as just part of life and evolution?
If you're same-sex oriented, do power dynamics play into your sex life?
Edit: Everyone has such great answers, thank you!
It's looking like I should try being a switch sometime :) 
Also, I don't really want to get into a discussion about #notallmen or feminism or any of that, just looking for personal opinions on non-BDSM heterosexual sex and how you view it!
M42 here, married 23 years.
I really don't see power dynamics in our bedroom.
We listen to one another.
We do all sorts of kinky shit, but it's mutually decided on.
I choke my wife a little bit every now and then - because she gets off on it, not because I'm imposing my will or whatever.
Do some people have power dynamics?
Sure.
You see dom/sub stuff here all the time.
But I don't think this is a requirement for sex.
&gt;porn porn porn

Meh.
Pro porn is largely bullshit, anyway.
Just because some people are into that doesn't mean that is how sex actually is.
Remember, porn is to actual sex as a Die Hard movie is to real police work.
As for the men/women objects/subjects... in my opinion, you are thinking way too much.
This sounds like a step or two down the slippery slope of the "all sex is rape" type radical feminism.
I mean... sometimes, my wife pees on me (by my request).
Yes, she's standing over me, but she's not degrading me - she's doing it because I want her to.
Sometimes, her legs go over my shoulders and I fuck her hard and fast... because she likes how that feels.
sometimes, she pegs me... because I want her to.
She's thrusting, and yeah, I'm the "receiver"... but there is no "she's in charge now" feeling, because we never try to be in charge.
We just do things that feel good, that make each other feel good.
People are people.
Our genitals fit together a certain way, yes, but sex should be an active partnership if everybody is going to be happy.
Now for some people, that means latex suits, ropes, whips, and somebody being THE BOSS.
Awesome for them.
for some people, it does mean the guy pins the woman down and fucks her however he wants.
If they both like that?
Awesome for them.
But neither of those are default settings.
Find someone that respect you, that you respect, and have whatever sort of sex you both enjoy.

This bothers me.
I respect women.
I teach my sons to respect women.
Some men do learn disrespect, but your view here that this is the default feels pretty gross.
Thanks for responding-

I agree that most porn is bullshit, but it's also the case that a lot of people watch porn when they're pretty young and don't know that that's not how real sex is, and get it into their head that it is, which I think is a shame.
Respectfully, I don't think it's a bad thing to think critically about big topics (and I think sex and how men and women think about sex is one of those), and I don't think I'm thinking "too much".
I'm a feminist but just because I'm curious about people's thoughts on the complementarity of our roles during sex doesn't make me a radical.
I totally agree that sex should be an active partnership!
I'm all for no default settings and mutual respect.
&amp;#x200B;
Please understand, I'm not attacking you at all.
I think that critical thinking is a skill that needs far more practice than it currently gets.
Please note that at no point did I disparage you personally - but I did question some of the claims you have made.
&gt; I'm a feminist but just because I'm curious about people's thoughts on the complementarity of our roles during sex doesn't make me a radical.
Never said that you were.
What I said was that acting as if all sex automatically makes a woman an object and a man a subject is taking you down that slippery slope.
Woman are not objects just because their anatomy means that their partner's genitals fit inside of their bodies.
Women are only sex objects if their partner views and treat them as such - and they permit that to happen.
You have some valid concerns about shitty guys not viewing you with respect.
Just like I tell my daughter - don't have sex with shitty guys.
Well, to be fair, I give that advice pretty universally, regardless of gender.
I completely understand, and don't think you're attacking me at all!
I can see where you're coming from, I'm just not sure I agree about it being a slippery slope (mainly because that idea that "all sex is rape" is so absurd) because I don't think it has to be inherently negative if it is in fact the case that women take a naturally passive "object"-like role in sex (it just can make me personally uncomfortable when I think of it like that!)
I appreciate that you have a more neutral-positive view of sex with no clear power dynamics based on physiology, I wish that was more the case.
I totally agree with you, though unfortunately you can't always know who's shitty.
I've been pretty damn lucky though on that front, and hopefully your daughter has been and will be too :)
I can agree that you aren't going that far (all sex is rape).
But from here, it sure seems like you are awfully close to that.
Why does a woman have to be an object?
I mean... in my book, a woman that just lays there and takes it isn't much of a sex partner.
You need to be moving squeezing, stroking, etc.
If you're doing that, are you not an active participant?
So how can you be an active participant **and** an object?
It's an interesting dichotomy you have there.
I wonder where those feelings come from?
Men want sex, use women for it; women... tolerate sex?
I think we're disagreeing on the definition of object.
I don't mean that a woman does nothing while a guy fucks her, I mean (to take from a thesaurus here) an object as "a person or thing to which a specified action or feeling is directed", meaning only that the woman does less and that the action is initiated by the man.
"How can you be an active participant **and** an object?"
That is a fucking great question!
Maybe you can't.
Maybe you can be an active participant but still have less power, and by that definition are more of an object in a subject-object relationship (which is different than being a sex object).
I don't really think there's a definitive answer here, which is why I just posted this to get opinions.
Again, not at all what I'm saying - I think men and women both want sex!
You can hold less power in a two-person dynamic and still love it and be turned on, in fact, it may turn you on more (hence the popularity of BDSM).
I think you're using a flawed definition of object, then, if you rule that a person loses their agency, despite freely choosing to be an active participant in something, simply because something is being done to them.
Totally valid argument.
I don't think it's a flawed definition, but perhaps one that shouldn't be utilized for examining the act of sex, which is fair.
Re: your edit

That’s great that you teach your sons to respect women!
That doesn’t mean that’s the norm though.
I understand that it feels gross, but believe me it feels grosser as a woman who has been told not to walk alone at night, to ever leave my drink alone, to have my headphones in in an area that isn’t crowded.
Women are constantly told both that 1) We shouldn’t distrust men, how dare you paint us all with this brush and 2) We need to be vigilant in case they try to hurt us.
If a girl was raped, “You should have been more cautious, not been alone with him, not done that, etc.” Can you imagine how frustrating it is trying to reconcile those two messages all the time?
Just the fact that there are such high rape and domestic violence rates indicates there’s a large problem at hand.
I think it’s getting better, because I am optimistic at heart even if it doesn’t show in this thread, but parenting is only one influence in how people develop ways of thinking about the world or people (in this case, women).
I understand the frustration; I have both sons and daughters.
What bothers me is that your statement that I quoted crosses the line into sexism.
As a mod, I routinely remove comments that are worded similarly towards either gender.
Another mod approved your post, but I don't know that they really considered exactly what you said here; I would have personally removed it until you removed the sexism.
Let's change arenas and consider race instead.
There is no doubt about it - in the USA, blacks are far more likely to commit violent crimes.
That's just simple statistics.
Let's say you are alone in an inner city.
I don't care if you're male or female, you're going to stick to well lit areas, stay in populated areas, etc.
It's just common sense, it has nothing to do with racism.
Correct?
Because if we really dig into it, crime rates tend to be more tied into social status, education levels, etc - but blacks in the USA tend to start with way more strikes than whites, don't they?
Surely you wouldn't be okay with saying something like "it makes me wary to trust blacks, since they are more likely to rob or murder me."
Why?
Because you surely understand that disproportionate or not, it's still a situation where a minority portion of a given population - that is not representative of that population as a whole - is responsible for the bad acts.
So why is it okay to paint men as bad?
Yes, you have to be careful with your drink.
You have to be careful of who you go home with, etc, etc... because you know that there are bad apples out there.
That doesn't make it okay to paint all men as rapists, nor does it make it okay to paint all men as disrespecting/objectifying women.

Summary: 
I wonder where those feelings come from?
I think we're disagreeing on the definition of object.
But I don't think this is a requirement for sex.
If they both like that?
sometimes, she pegs me... because I want her to.
