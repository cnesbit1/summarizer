Original Response: 
I have never been to Amsterdam or the RLD (Red Light District) but since I was there, I thought why the hell not try at least once.
I would estimate that there's about 150 girls over the space of three streets, including little alleyways where most of the windows are, rather than on full view next to the canals.
**Night 1**

I walked around for a long, long time before deciding if I was even going to do anything at all.
I think it was maybe 90 minutes of walking back and forth through three streets, trying to decide and build up the courage to knock on a window.
Eventually, I didn't need to knock - they lured me over.
And when I say they, it was actually two girls.
They were both wearing just bra and panties.
I asked how much.
â‚¬100 for both of them.
Both of them would suck my cock and I could fuck one of them.
I asked if I could kiss them.
No.
I asked if they'd kiss each other.
No.
It's always been a fantasy to have a threesome so fuck it, I agreed.
Gave them â‚¬100.
They led me to a bedroom.
Some small talk which I expected from them.
What's your name, where are you from, are you new etc.
Once that was out of the way, one of them asked me to take my pants off.
It wasn't sexy.
It was like being at a doctor's exam.
I got undressed and they asked me to lay on the bed.
"So which of us do you want to fuck?"
one of them asked.
"Just a blowjob", I replied.
Honestly, I was a  little too nervous for sex.
"Oh, perfect!
", one of said, which was said in a kind of "And I don't even have to have your cock inside me!".
Bit offputting, but ok. "You can touch us ok?".
One held my cock and put what can only be described as a paper towel with a hole through it over my cock, then ran a baby wipe over my cock, then put a condom over it.
It was still soft at this point since the fun hadn't started.
Girl A starts sucking my cock like a machine, from 0-100 in a second while the other girl starts making "mmm baby" sounds while rubbing my nipples.
Obviously getting touched by two girls sounds great, but instantly going for it caught me off guard!
It took me a few minutes to adjust to it and get into it.
They started talking to each other casually while one had my cock in their mouth and now and then jerking me off instead.
It was really offputting.
I'm almost certain they were talking about me from the tone of their voice and I think it was probably something like "This guy isn't cumming quickly is he?
", "No he isn't".
I asked one of the girls to take her bra off so I could see her tits.
"No that's extra baby".
"Ok".
They kept going for a little longer, changing from sucking and jerking.
Then I asked to fuck one of them, as we'd initially agreed.
"No you can't now", since apparently me changing my mind from just a blowjob to sex (Same deal they offered upon entering) wasn't allowed.
"But if you give us another â‚¬100 you can have sex with one of us and one of us can be naked?
", "No, this is good", "But it will feel better", "â‚¬100 is good".
We're about ten minutes into things at this point and honestly, it wasn't really doing much for me because there was no passion.
I asked them to speed up and I cum.
They took the condom off and I went to wipe my cock and they wouldn't let me, they did it for me.
"Ok, now you can clean up".
I got dressed, I asked them their names - Isobel and Katrina, said thanks and left.
As someone who needs the whole kissing and touching and general closeness when it comes to sex, I felt pretty let down really, but also on a bit of a high from just playing with two hot girls.
My brain didn't know what to think.
**Night 2**

I wanted to see how one girl would be on her own so that's what I looked for.
Again, I spent about an hour walking around, up and down the same streets and I could tell some of the girls were recognising me from the day before and, well, seeing me about 60 seconds ago.
The girl I found looked great and from the night before, had a better idea of what I wanted and what would be offered.
â‚¬50 for blowjob and sex.
"I'll give you â‚¬100 if I can suck on your tits as well".
"Ok".
I knew what to expect a bit more this time so I just started to get undressed while she took her bra and panties off and made small talk with me at the same time.
It's kind of weird being asked stuff like "So, where are you from?
", so casually, while also preparing to have sex.
This girl did genuinely seem friendlier than the first two, however.
The downside was that once in the room, I realised it smelled strongly of smoke and as a non smoker, it really puts me off.
Still, I'd already paid so no going back now.
She lay on the bed and told me to kneel between her legs while she put a condom on me.
I was about to help when she asked me not to touch my cock and I realised that these girls really are that strict about anything remotely risky when it comes to STDs.
Instead, she got me hard, opened her legs and guided me inside her herself.
This felt a little more relaxed than the previous night, but the downside was that this girl would not let go of my cock while it was inside her because I guess she was worried about the condom slipping.
This made it pretty uncomfortable for me to thrust inside her and so after a minute or two of that, I gave up and asked her to jerk me off instead.
Her tits looked great but I realised as soon as I touched them that they were fake.
I've never felt fake tits before but man, they're so different.
Imagine a balloon, but imagine a smooth rock inside the balloon.
That's kind of how fake tits feel.
They didn't feel bad as such, just different.
Again, when you've only got 15 minutes to experience something entirely new to you, you're just not ready for these things!
She jerked me off until I cum.
Again, she asked me not to touch myself and pulled the condom off before cleaning me, then giving me more tissues to clean myself.
While I did so, she squeezed the condom with my cum in it, making sure there were no holes and nothing had leaked.
It's really weird to see someone inspect a condom like that.
It's so surgical and completely devoid of any of the things you might associate with sex usually.
She cleaned herself while I got dressed.
I asked her name but I honestly can't remember.
I know she was from Albania.
She asked me a little more about me while wiping her pussy casually and she did seem nicer than the first girls.
I asked her if I could give her a hug before I left and she obliged before wishing me a safe journey home.
**Conclusion**

If you're able to disassociate the act of either penetration or oral from the passion that usually goes with that (whether that's kissing, touching, feeling like you're hot to the other person etc), then the RLD is for you.
If you have a specific sexual request and you're willing to pay more than â‚¬50 for it, RLD is for you.
The girls are almost all 18-21 and they all have fantastic bodies.
If however, you need the slightest bit of either run-up to the sexual acts or you need a bit of intimacy before sex, RLD is going to leave you super disappointed.
I personally would probably attempt another girl or two before stopping altogether because I'm sure there are some who will go above and beyond, but in general, I doubt I will be rushing back to Amsterdam to fuck more of them.
Hope you enjoyed reading!
Amsterdam RLD is probably the worst place to have your first hooker experiences, and maybe also at all.
Why is that?
Where's the best place?
Maybe a brothel in Nevada?
Noice.
Time to take a Fear And Loathing vacation.
A place with good reputation.
We have forums for this..
Yeah we do, but I just assumed since you said Amsterdam is the worst place, you would also say where the best place is.
Did you read OP?
I heard Hong kong in Tijuana is supposed to be pretty cool.
Germany is worth a shout, Amsterdam has been an awful tourist trap for years.
Nowhere unless you expect what you're getting yourself into.
come to Switzerland man.
I tried to Hong Kong in Tijuana but she said that was extra.
Bangkok.
DR...?
Whaaaat where.
This is where my ex got the nasty disease he brought home.
Then the prostitute proceeded to whatsapp him constantly asking for money and other things.
Reminds me of Annie and that guy Tobo from the show 90 Day Fiance.
Marrying bookers from Thailand that won't let go.
Literally everywhere: there are many brothels around and prostitutes often rent apartments where they can work.
There are many websites too.
Prostitution is legal here.
I only visited Zurich and Lucerne and the Jungfrau region...I couldâ€™ve got laid in these places ?
Damn these missed opportunities.
Well it's because it isn't bright and obvious like the Red Light District in Amsterdam: brothels are often normal buildings with a sign outside, and almost always not in the in city center (like Amsterdam).
I takes a 10 minutes research on internet and you should find places...

Edit: never been to Zurich to fuck but I bet everything I have there are many places to go lol.
Luzern it's a sure thing.
Jungfrau no idea.
Well depends on which brothel you go to.
My friends have been there so many times they now know some pimps personally who give them discounted rates everytime they are there.
And the girls are clean, no STDs or clingy types.
My friend has been telling me constantly to go to one of those establishments where he is a a regular and get rid of my V card with one of the girls over there.
Jungfrau almost certainly not, there was barely a coop to get food.
Crazy I had no idea.
Guaranteed, if you're going through an airport turnstile sideways.
&amp;#x200B;
A brothel in the Netherlands.
Or, if you specifically want to do the RLD experience, The Hague or Eindhoven.
Google fkk saunas in Germany ðŸ˜‰.
There probably is some sort of local "announcements" site that you could use.
It will almost certainly be better than a brothel and there is much slimmer chance of getting mugged or scamed.
For Poland it's roksa.pl for example.
Just googling "escorts" + [your location] will suffice probably.
I did, I just didnâ€™t think that it was the absolute worst way it could have gone, considering thereâ€™s a lot of places where itâ€™s actually dangerous to try and solicit services.
That one big/popular one in Nevada sounded pretty good last time when I read that AMA one of the workers did.
If you're in Germany sometime, look up "Sauna Club" or "FKK Club" in your vicinity.
The "club" keyword is indicating that it isn't just a place to have sauna time or be naked.
They charge an entry fee that pays you a more or less luxurious spa experience.
Some buffet will normally also be included.
You can stay as long as you want.
You can walk amidst a sometimes large setup of pretty ladies, in some locations completely nude right from the start, which are all very approachable.
f you like one, she will start negotiations which may include getting real close and cozy.
Warming you up a bit.
If you reciprocate, she will ask you if you want to go to a room with her.
Should you agree, be prepared to pay about 30-50â‚¬ for half an hour.
Her services typically include bj and sex in several positions, but many are also open to french kissing.
If something is very important for your experience, ask if she is doing that.
Special wishes like anal she may or may not do, but that tends to cost extra.
Be aware that the women working there are independent contractors.
They pay a fee for working in the club, and you pay them directly for what they offer.
Do NOT go into an FKK sauna, beach or club in Germany and expect sex.
It's not at all about sex.
Could you please explain?
What is it about?
It's usually just a bunch of (usually older) people who enjoy being naked as much as possible, for a variety of reasons.
There may be brothels that are called "FKK clubs", too.
But most FKK clubs aren't brothels.
Last one was Sharks FKK not far from Frankfurt.
And it was ridiculously great.
Never see so many different girls, all polite and smiling.
So I would definitely recommend it over Amsterdam RLD.
Guessing it was the best FKK you've been to?
Plus it is bad for the women.
There is a lot of human trafficking involved.
Just because it is legal does not mean it is moral.
All of this is sad and pathethic.

Summary: 
Crazy I had no idea.
I know she was from Albania.
I asked if I could kiss them.
I asked if they'd kiss each other.
It's not at all about sex.
I asked them to speed up and I cum.
She jerked me off until I cum.

Honestly, I was a  little too nervous for sex.

Some small talk which I expected from them.
I asked her name but I honestly can't remember.
I asked one of the girls to take her bra off so I could see her tits.
â‚¬100 for both of them.
Both of them would suck my cock and I could fuck one of them.
"Ok, now you can clean up".
Well depends on which brothel you go to.
If you reciprocate, she will ask you if you want to go to a room with her.
