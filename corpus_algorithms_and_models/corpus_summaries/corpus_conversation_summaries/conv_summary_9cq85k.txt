Worst show ever.
In the course of the past week, I went from having no idea who she was, to finding out who she is and being super into her and digging all these pics of her, to now she has been posted *way* too much and I am already sick of her.
It's been a wild ride!
She's definitely suffering from oversaturation in this sub this week though.
I'd never even heard of it until this week.

People try to bandwagon and jump on the karma train by reposting pictures.
This pic was from the comments of her last big thread.
I think we've reached peak Brenda Song.
Time to sell your shares before the market collapses!
