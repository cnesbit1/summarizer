Original Response: 
Don’t have Ultra Moon to farm for it myself, willing to trade any Sun/Ultra Sun exclusive, except Solgaleo.
The mon being trade will be caught and nature verified by myself, will catch and verify before trade happens.
This can include any legendary given specifically by Ultra Sun.
I have a Japanese Modest Kyogre that i got off GTS, would you be interested in that?
Sure.
Cool.
Would you trade it for a Modest Xerneas?
Yea, I’ll get started farming that tomorrow morning if you don’t mind.
Cool, just hit me up when you're ready to trade.
I’ve run into a problem tonight, I went to start my game and I believe it’s corrupted.
I’ll be going over to the store tomorrow to pick up a new one, but that means I have to redo the entire story.
Can I request to have till Saturday to get the Modest Xerneas?
Yeah no problem, take your time.
I’ve started farming for the correct Xerneas, don’t know how long this will take from here.
I’m gonna go to bed for now, but tomorrow I’ll get up and farm all day if I have to.
Don't worry, i'm in no rush!
Mewtwo twice, Raikou once, Dialga once, Virizion once, and about 45 regular wormholes....
These green wormholes hate me.
I have it... finally.

Summary: 
Would you trade it for a Modest Xerneas?
Cool, just hit me up when you're ready to trade.
