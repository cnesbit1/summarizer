Sorry our motto is “cheaper, better, faster”.
Half the pay double the output at half the duration by doing OT.
On a side note.
Mine is a US based company.
That’s why we have flexible working hours, can work from home etc.
so long you finish your work.
I reach office 10:30 and leave by 6.
Unless I need to talk to us market then no choice need wake up at 7.

That is not typical for a US company.
US tech company *.
The other industries still in dinosaur era.
I think it depends on the size of the company.
I’ve worked for 3 mid to small sized US tech companies and I have a very flexible schedule and can work from home whenever I want to a reasonable extend.
In fact, I let my guys choose 2 days a week to work from home, which is very much appreciated by young parents.
The downside is my boss expects me to be available at US hours whenever I have to.
My weekly call with him is at 12mn Wednesday and worst, staff meetings at mn on Friday....

The fact that you worked for tech companies is a much bigger factor here than the size of the company.
PM company please.

I'll volunteer.
PM companies please.
Got a lot of opportunities to travel to the US?
May i ask what industry are you in?
Nah, I got friends working in other industries, meet for happy hour 5pm.
Fine.
But you shouldn't be led to believe that is common for American companies, or small American companies.
It's common in only very specific fields and unusual elsewhere.

Summary: 
Mine is a US based company.
