Original Response: 
[electrek.co](https://electrek.co) articles should be banned.
It's pretty much written by Tesla themselves.
So?
This sub seems to give importance to Tesla PR - why not a fanboy site?
Is the article wrong?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrek

Itâ€™s biased, and therefore misleading in regards to the bigger picture.
Oh yeah, because Wikipedia says something - it's true!
Electrek's owner also owns a Chevy Bolt.
Does that make them Chevy biased?

Fyi, the bottom of every Wikipedia page has links to sources.
Feel free to dig up more sources on Google search.
And since reading isn't your thing...'some owners have stock' as of late 2016.
Fred isn't the owner.
Your sources suck.

Wahhhhhh.
