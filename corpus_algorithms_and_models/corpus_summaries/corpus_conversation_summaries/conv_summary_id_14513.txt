Original Response: 
Did she get some work done?
Cause she looks different.
A bad different.
I think the tangarine lipstick is making her look worse.
But she's also way more pale than normal and maybe a bit underweight?
She's been looking like she's been losing weight recently and you're right.
It doesn't look good on her.
She needs to put on a little bit more weight.
Yeah she looks like she's not feeling so well.
I don't know, I saw her in an interview and she looked pretty much the same, maybe a bit skinnier.
I think it might just be the photo.
Like the rpg slider made her mouth three sizes too big for her face...

Summary: 
I think it might just be the photo.
