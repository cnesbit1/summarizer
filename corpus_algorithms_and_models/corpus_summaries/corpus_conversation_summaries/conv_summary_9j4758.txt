Original Response: 
Hey there everybody!
I have returned, once again with a new Foggy Memories review for everyone.
This time, I'm gonna be covering and discussing a well-known mod that I've been using extensively the [Geekvape Aegis Legend Kit](https://imgur.com/a/iQHT9MU).
The original single battery Geekvape Aegis was a Legend of a mod for its durability so the dual battery version was properly named the Aegis Legend.
This item was sent to me for review by [Geekvape](https://www.geekvape.com/project/aegis-legend-kit/) which won't effect my opinion of the item but is very cool of them to provide it for us to discuss here today.
I am a little bit behind on this review.
As most of you know, my wife left me and I took a mental health break for a little while.
Couldn't focus on vaping for a few weeks.
In all honesty I guess I'll probably needed a little bit of a break after riding non-stop reviews.
Regardless, I'm working really hard to try to get everything caught back up and I even remembered to include [a photo album](https://imgur.com/a/CG9DvNo) which I forgot on my last few reviews.
I've been meaning to have a photo album with all my reviews recently and forgot until I posted it.
You can still enter my [Eleaf Amnis](https://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/9gr78s/foggy_memories_eleaf_amnis_review_and_giveaway/) giveaway and in a few days I will name a winner and start another giveaway.
##Packaging
The Geekvape Aegis Legend comes in [flat wide box](https://imgur.com/a/LjN1UOg) with a picture of the Aegis Legend on the front in the color that's inside of the box.
It calls the Aegis the "indestructible beast" and also has some information about the mesh coils that are included on the inside with the tank.
On the [back of the box](https://imgur.com/a/ob6s1br) is information about the specs of the mod and how durable it is.
Pull the lid off the box and you will see the [Aegis Legend, the Areo tank, a straight glass for the tank, extra coil](https://imgur.com/a/juLQd8y) and an accessory box.
[Inside the box](https://imgur.com/a/qasU1c0) you're gonna find a flat micro USB cable, extra o-rings and seals for the tank, a 510 drip tip adapter and an extra rubber plug for the micro USB port to keep your Geekvape Aegis Legend waterproof incase you lose the one included in the mod.
Pull that tray out and find the [Paperwork](https://imgur.com/a/9WZEuqu) associated with the kit like a manual for the Aegis Legend and the Areo tank, a picture to show off some color options for the mod, warranty papers, and safety information.
##Aero Tank
The Geekvape Aegis Legend kit is going to come with the [Aero Sub-Ohm tank](https://imgur.com/a/JS3OUE8) which is a nice compliment to this mod.
At the top, it has thick Goon style 810 drip tip and the [top cap](https://imgur.com/a/jAjpDHB) for the tank having a built in o-ring.
This tank has the Zeus RTA style half twist locking system.
The [fill ports](https://imgur.com/a/6eX0f8G) on the top are wide enough for my unicorn bottles but any thicker tips might have trouble filling this tank.
Pre-installed on the Aero tank is a bubble glass that allows 5ml of juice and a straight glass also is included in the box that I believe holds 3.5ml of juice.
At the top and bottom of the glass is a ring that matches the color of frame and buttons of the mod.
The very bottom has dual airflow holes and a black adjustment ring that has plenty of resistance to keep it in place but is easy to adjust though I rock most tanks wide open and this is no exception.
Included with this tank is [two coils](https://imgur.com/a/rmP0cuR), one of which a quad coil round wire style coil and a one of the nice Geekvape super mesh coil.
##Aegis Legend Mod
The mod that is properly named because it is a Legend and the big brother to the original, single battery Legend.
Functionality wise, this is a dual 18650 device that operates with the Geekvape AS chip like the one in the Nova mod.
I really like this fast firing chip.
It fires from 5-200 watts in wattage mode, does TC for NI, TI and SS coils, bypass mode, VPC which is adjustable power curve and TCR mode.
This chip performs great and fires fast for me it's not the star of the show here.
The housing of the Aegis Legend is IP67 water and dust resistant, designed for high shock resistance and water proof.
On the [top plate](https://imgur.com/a/ebGhn6Z) has a nice looking brushed finish and is made of stainless steel powdered metallurgy.
I don't fully understand what that means but I know it's tough material.
The top is also surrounded by the silicone casing I gonna cover next.
Half of the outer casing is [LSR Silicone](https://imgur.com/a/BKDwf4V) and is thick and protects the device from shock when dropped.
Also, the silicon is used as a [waterproof USB plug](https://imgur.com/a/zTUQaOZ) to make sure water stays out of the circuitry.
It [pulls out to reveal the USB port](https://imgur.com/a/bZAQakJ).
A spare plug is also included incase you would happen to lose this one.
Pinning the rubber frame around the chassis is the [die-cast aluminum](https://imgur.com/a/mvvKgF2) frame section that's screwed in with two screws on each side.
The color of this section is going to match the [buttons on the front](https://imgur.com/a/UmR69lg) that's zinc die cast alloys.
I was interested in this fire Button since I first saw it.
It looked to me like a slide or a toggle switch almost.
It does actually press straight down and has a very nice, tactile click.
When you press it, it has a nice click and has a nice click when you release the button.
The up and down rocker is pretty sweet as well.
It's extremely easy to hit what your trying to select and the way it dips in at the center, you can easily hold up and down pressed at the same time and lock the device.
Like the top section, it seems durable and hasn't shown scratches seems to hold the rubber front part and the [leather palm grip](https://imgur.com/a/Q42TYBm) into place.
This real leather section rests in your palm if your trigger firing the mod.
It has a section of stitching going down the spine of the leather.
Leather is not only durable but also adds grip and comfort in the hand.
The opposite side is gonna have a color screen with a [fire button and adjustment rocker](https://imgur.com/a/NLJmksB) matching the color of the aluminum frame.
The screen has tons of information like like your mode, wattage, temp if that's your thing, resistance, voltage, amps and puffs.
Also, like the Nova, you can change the color of the screen by triple clicking the fire button then hitting the up and down buttons at the same time.
This can rotate from [Blue](https://imgur.com/a/CAuGVWL) to a [Red](https://imgur.com/a/d9nq3bc) or a [purplish](https://imgur.com/a/LLRmyXn) thou the blue and purple are kinda similar.
Whatever type of material is covering the screen is durable as well.
As much as I've thrown this mod around, it doesn't have any scratches on it.
The last past of this long description is the [battery door](https://imgur.com/a/Y8tRhEL) and this is a serious battery door.
When you [release the latch](https://imgur.com/a/nYHcZkH) this door springs open with authority.
The door doesn't have any wobble when opened either.
The battery contacts on the door are raised up, sitting on a gasket that when closed, makes the the battery compartment waterproof.
The latch that closes and locks the door is made of 40hrc carbon steel and that sounds like serious stuff.
When you slide the tab to open the door, it locks open, you [insert batteries](https://imgur.com/a/sYsCkOJ), close door, then slide the lock into the locked position and you are ready to vape.
##Performance
The performance of this mod is gonna be basically my same impression I had of the [Nova Kit](https://amp.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/998rpa/foggy_memories_geekvape_nova_kit_review/) that I reviewed note too long ago.
I love the chip, it fires fast and works great for me.
I've seen people say that it wasn't great for TC mode but I've tested it and it was fine for me.
I use wattage mode for vaping in my day to day life and this is fantastic for that.
Battery life was also great as expected with a dual 18650 device and running at 35-40 watts like myself.
Durability is a main factor here and while I didn't test the waterproof aspects, I did throw this all over my home, repeatability and drop it on the kitchen floor over and over again.
You can't tell it got dropped at all.
I have some brand new mods in my collection that I know wouldn't survive getting thrown and dropped like that at all and the Aegis Legend was scratch free.
##Conclusion
This is bad ass.
Just gonna say it.
I usually just tell you my experience and let you make a decision based on that.
I really like this mod.
You know what it reminds me of, my favorite mod, my [Paranormal Dna75c](https://imgur.com/a/VZsQFGr) because it had a similar type of design.
Though the Aegis is able to hold a [30mm flush](https://imgur.com/a/IcyHcSy) and looks great with a [28mm tank](https://imgur.com/a/18U6fBT) which doesn't seem too large at all.
Plus, this thing is shockproof, Dustproof and waterproof.
In my opinion, if you want a durable dual 18650 mod, this is the go to mod.
I actually threw this mod drunkenly around my house many, many times to test it's shock resistance and its still going.
It has zero stratches from me dropping it from above my head, to the kitchen floor over and over again.
Trust me, I dropped it a lot.
Looking at it right now, you could never tell that I've abused it.
I wouldn't even consider it too big or bulky.
There are some sleeker dual 18650 mods, but they're nowhere as durable.
Smaller mods have a time and a place, and the Agents Legend has a time and a place for when you don't know what you're going to get into that day and you need a mod that can withstand basically anything.
Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it.
I really want to thank [Geekvape](https://www.geekvape.com/project/aegis-legend-kit/) for providing the item for us to discuss here today.
They make very nice mods and it was a pleasure to test it out!

nice review on a nice mod!
Thanks man!
I appreciate it.
It's hard to no like this mod.
I forgot my one gripe, the puff counter resets at 999.
Ive already rolled it over once maybe twice.

yeah,   while i'm not a big fan of the puff counter thing,  or use it much,   i don't know why they have it like they do (as they do on their other mods as well....)... why not got to 6/7 figures on that?
mine has rolled over countless times on this and the Nova,  so I have no damn idea...
Lol I never pay attention to those personally.
Dont really care about puff counters.
It's my odometer, lol.
I got around 3,000 on both the Aegis and Nova.
I know the puff counter isn't important but on my Paranormal, I'm proud of the 25,000 puffs it has.
If I wasn't reviewing other things, that Paranormal would be at like 150,000, lol.
hell,  i find it interesting in THAT regard as well,  like my damn little Epsion i won as a giveaway and thought would just be a beater,  hell,  it has 90k on the counter,  and it's far from my main mod.... so i'm a degenerate,  but i know my Legend and Nova etc probably have 10,000 on them by now EASY.

I guess i find it interesting in terms of either finding out how much i use a mod,  or it's lifespan.....
LMAO i don't worry how much i vape personally.
but i can see how others would.
I find the puff counter handy for judging the longevity of coils.
Having one that resets after 999, though, doesn't help me any as both the coils for my Cleito Pro and Fireluke Mesh are good for far more than 999 puffs.
I've also lost count of how many times it's rolled over.
yeah,  i change tanks too much on mods for that to work for me,  but i hear you and that can help measure certain things depending on juice and whatnot...  and yes,  those mesh pro coils will last forever....
Actually, it's just the non-Pro Fireluke Mesh.
Got screwed at the store, and didn't notice till I got home.
What I really wanted was the Freemax Fireluke, the one with the RTA deck, and which also accepts those beefy Mesh Pro Coils.
I had called ahead and asked for the Freemax Fireluke, was told it was in stock, and so had a black one set aside.
The way it's packaged I couldn't see what was in the accessory bag, what the spare glass looked like, etc., and the employee told me that policy would not allow us to open it before I purchased it, and, of course, no refunds or exchanges once opened...turns out it was the Fireluke Mesh, with the smaller coils and small tank.
Doesn't take the Mesh Pro coils.
Couldn't resist finding the right one online the moment I realized my mistake and ordering it, though.
The dildofaced employee at the store even sold me the Mesh Pro replacement coils, stating they would fit the incorrect tank he had sold me, and would not refund or exchange either the coils or tank, so it was either get stuck with coils I can't use, or spend even more and get the tank I actually wanted, and at least have the Fireluke Mesh as a back-up tank.
oh fuck off that sucks.
what a shitty store....
I just bought the aegis, but the alien 220 it replaces had 45,683 on it.
not bad for an alien!
Enjoy the Aegis,  I know I am!
Thanks, man!
I loved the alien's fit in the hand, and I couldn't find anything close until I held the aegis.
Plus I'm a sucker for snakeskin :)
cool,  yeah i wish i had gotten a snakeskin one (i have a black one and a camo one),  but i like the snakeskin... dammit,.... but i have a "snakeskin" therion dna 166 so that will have to do!

Summary: 
I really like this mod.
It's hard to no like this mod.
Enjoy the Aegis,  I know I am!
nice review on a nice mod!
I really like this fast firing chip.
Trust me, I dropped it a lot.
I got around 3,000 on both the Aegis and Nova.
