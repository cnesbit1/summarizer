Botas Chihuahua on Holly and Airline is the best place in town for boot repairs.
They also will custom make full boots for you, it really is a one stop shop for boots.
The guy also owns Taqueria Almeida next door and it's delicious.
Awesome thanks and I wish I could afford a pair of custom boots... one day.
There at least used to be a shoe repair in Padre Staples Mall.
Shoe repair shop in La Palmera mall!!!
They are the best and have been there for AGES they fixed my Doc Martin's heel for 6ish bucks this was last month.
I came in to say this.
Also, get tacos next door when you drop your boots off.
They're fairly reasonable at chihuahua believe it or not.
i think it's still there.
drive thru.
i used to go there and the guy at parkdale.
Agreed!
This place does really good work.
I just got my Tony Lama's resoled a couple weeks ago.
I had gotten them at a resale shop, so they were pretty beat up and scuffed.
He put on brand new soles and heel cups.
He even polished them up nice and pretty and fixed some of the scratches.
They almost look brand new now!
