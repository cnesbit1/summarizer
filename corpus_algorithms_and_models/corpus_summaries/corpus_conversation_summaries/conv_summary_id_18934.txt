Really wish we got to see those tatas from the HIMYM era.
That's why I dig small-chested women.
Her tatas today are basically the same as her tatas during the Buffy era, the American Pie era, and the HIMYM era.
Heck, they'll probably be the same 20 years from now too.
Have the same hopes for Amy Acker.
Someone needs to start offering them more independent movie roles.
LOL, really?
Buffy era and American Pie era are the same era.
Well, to be fair American Reunion was 9 years after Buffy ended, but yeah I guess you're right.
Just seemed different on the Big Screen I guess.

Summary: 
Buffy era and American Pie era are the same era.
