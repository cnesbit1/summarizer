Original Response: 
Hey guys,

Looking at renting a Honda Rebel 250 for eight hours when I'm in Osaka and riding somewhere for some nice scenic and fun roads.
Does anyone have some suggestions on routes to hit up once we get out of the city?
If anything, should we head North, East or South for a eight hour round trip tour?
Thanks for any thoughts!
Since you posted in /r/motorcycles rather than in /r/RideitJapan/ I presume you do not live in Japan, and that you're here on vacation.
You may have some additional luck by crossposting in /r/JapanTravel as well as RideitJapan.
I strongly suggest looking at a bike other than the Rebel 250 for starters.
VTR250s are a much better, more powerful, much more fun bike, and not available in the US, so it'll be a new experience for you.
Plus, they're way more suited to the roads you'll be encountering.
Osaka is a huge city.
It'll largely depend on where you rent from, but a majority of your 8 hours could easily be caught up slogging through traffic and stoplights, so if you're renting from 819, make sure your shop is on the outskirts somewhere rather than right downtown.
The Kii peninsula has a lot to offer, but 8 hours is a short time to spend there.
If you think you can make it, I highly suggest Mt.
Koya and the ancient temple complex there, as well as the extremely fun Ryujin-Koyasan skyline (route 371).
Wherever you end up going, spend some time with google street view, and avoid the prefectural routes (shown as yellow in google maps).
Look for the smaller white roads which will keep you away from the more dense traffic.
Feel free to PM me with your intended rental location, general experience with motorcycles, and anything else you think is relevant and I'll be able to go into a lot more detail.
Never heard of /r/RideitJapan, will have to check that out!
And I'm a bit ahead of ya, also cross posted on /r/JapanTravel (can't believe how detailed that sub is...).
I was looking at bikes offered and picked from the shops list: a Rebel 250, Vulcan S, and MT-07.
They responded with the Rebel so I thought maybe that's all they had.
VTR250s does look fun, I was thinking a cruiser might facilitate scenic tourists a bit more.
I was looking at 819, and had picked a shop in the Minato Ward, which, looks to be the opposite of the outskirts lol.
Didn't know they had a lot of different shops.
Will have to try and find a location a bit further out.
I actually was looking at riding to Mt.
Koya!
We wanted to stay there overnight but it didn't fall in the cards to let us.
You seem to know a lot about riding in Japan, my one big question I suppose I have other than routes is how safe it is riding a motorcycle around?
I have not opted to pick up travel health insurance and I'd much rather avoid going into steep debt from some fun.
Thanks a ton for your response, helped a lot!
I did 371 this spring during the bloom on a WR250.
A wild beautiful day it was &lt;3.
&gt; I was looking at 819, and had picked a shop in the Minato Ward, which, looks to be the opposite of the outskirts lol.
Yeah, that might be fun at first, and challenging but I think it will get extremely overwhelming.
It's confusing, congested, many of the streets won't even have names, the street markings are different than you're used to, and even though most of the signs are in English the place names won't mean anything to you.
Here's a shop close to a train station that's a better reach to good riding: https://www.rental819.com/area/shopinfo.php?tenpoid=08101&amp;area=7

They have at least 1 VTR250, and another bike I highly suggest is the CB400.
The Ninja 400 or 250 are also great bikes for Japanese roads.
&gt; I was thinking a cruiser might facilitate scenic tourists a bit more.
The Rebel won't handle in the hills and narrow roads as well as the VTR250 will.
It's an ok bike, I've ridden it, but it's lacking the torque you'll need.
&gt; You seem to know a lot about riding in Japan, my one big question I suppose I have other than routes is how safe it is riding a motorcycle around?
I've been riding daily here for almost 10 years.
It's very safe compared to the US.
Speed limits are ridiculously slow though (almost all roads are 50 kph or less), so that could take some time getting used to.
You can get away with moderate speeding, but don't push it too much.
I think your biggest surprise here will be how technical the roads are.
&gt; I have not opted to pick up travel health insurance and I'd much rather avoid going into steep debt from some fun.
As for any rental anywhere, it will come with insurance which will include medical care.
At 819, it's very reasonable per day.
I also suggest looking into OSMAnd (or OSMios for iPhone) for routing your ride.
Google maps can't be downloaded and used offline in Japan due to some kind of corporate legal thing.
Google maps also tends to reroute you to the major roads, and towards the traffic.
I only use it for point A to point B navigation.
OSM is free, you can download the maps so it works offline, and it can be quickly programmed with a specific route.
I suggest downloading it and spending some time learning how to use it before you come here, so you're familiar with it before you have to rely on it.
That was a great write up answering my questions, thank you so much!
Will second Route 371, I usually keep going down to Shirahama and it's 100km of amazing roads with about 3 traffic lights after Mt.
Koya.
A word of warning, route 425 (Ryujin - Totsukawa) down there looks tempting but it's considered to be one of the worst national routes in Japan.
I blundered in there on a damp autumn day and spent the next 30-40km slipping the clutch in 2nd and hoping not to fall off a cliff.

Thanks for your suggestion on that rental place south of Osaka, looks like we are going to go that route.
I've kind of mapped out two rough routes in some first stage planning and would love your thoughts on them?
Both I have set "avoid tolls" but the bikes do come with an ETC card if we slip through one.
This one says it'd be just under 5 hours, which would leave enough time with an 8 hour rental period for some breaks, food and sightseeing.

This one would give us more of that route 371 you were talking about, but introduces about an hour more.
Less time for stopped activities (but if I'm renting a bike I'm probably not going to want to be stopped long).

Sounded like /u/SuperTaiyaki had some good Japan riding experience if he cared to share his thoughts too?
Route 1 has a section of expressway that's free.
You'll have to be careful because if you take the wrong exit, you'll end up on the tollway.
Your rental comes with an ETC reader, but unless you have an ETC card (combined with a Japanese credit card), you can't use it.
There is such a thing as a prepaid ETC card, but that requires paperwork and a sizable down payment.
In both of your routes, I suggest something more like [this](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/''/Koya-san,+Koyasan,+K%C5%8Dya,+Ito+District,+Wakayama+Prefecture+648-0211,+Japan/Ryujin+Onsen+Motoyu+annex,+5-%E7%95%AA%E5%9C%B0+Ryujinmura+Ryujin,+Tanabe,+Wakayama+Prefecture+645-0525,+Japan/Aragi-jima+Island+Rice+Terraces/%E3%81%84%E3%81%9A%E3%81%BF%E3%81%95%E3%81%AE%E8%87%AA%E5%8B%95%E8%BB%8A%E6%95%99%E7%BF%92%E6%89%80,+Japan,+%E3%80%92598-0032+Osaka+Prefecture,+Izumisano,+Shinyasumatsu,+2+Chome%E2%88%926%E2%88%9222/@34.1793297,135.2556,11.04z/data=!4m39!4m38!1m10!1m1!1s0x0:0x70f2a4e4c87b4250!2m2!1d135.305267!2d34.396315!3m4!1m2!1d135.3790618!2d34.2152135!3s0x60073135b306cf81:0xa9ae65e892f91dd1!1m5!1m1!1s0x60072773135b4c93:0x90380466b7e8dd6e!2m2!1d135.5833333!2d34.2166667!1m5!1m1!1s0x60070329bd9528bf:0x66afd00fc33f4ba1!2m2!1d135.5613165!2d33.9557402!1m5!1m1!1s0x60073cf2881d1e7b:0xd86570c027864ed1!2m2!1d135.4209353!2d34.0922891!1m5!1m1!1s0x6000c82249ee7d3f:0x70f2a4e4c87b4250!2m2!1d135.305267!2d34.396315!2m1!2b1!3e0?shorturl=1) to avoid some of the traffic.
The Aragijima rice fields are [beautiful](https://i.imgur.com/DBDMKWL.jpg), but you have to catch them in September to see them at their peak.
By the time you get there they'll be harvested.
[This](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E3%81%82%E3%82%89%E3%81%8E%E5%B3%B6%E5%B1%95%E6%9C%9B%E5%8F%B0/@34.0933404,135.4178123,17.08z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x60073cf2ca842967:0xf5d7ef6c5780eac4!8m2!3d34.0938887!4d135.4201573?shorturl=1) is the best place to view them.
There has been some road damage in Wakayama with the past few typhoons and resulting heavy rains.
[This site](http://www2.wagmap.jp/wakayamadoro/search/shisetsulist.asp?dtp=500) has a list of road closures.
I compared it to the routes you listed, and it looks like you'll be ok.

Edit: Also on route 371 is a small [rest area](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Road+Station+Tanabe+Ryujin+Sesame's+Sky+Tower/@34.0584674,135.528351,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x30082b1e8d1bf9f7!8m2!3d34.0619213!4d135.5642509?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;shorturl=1) where loads of motorcyclists congregate.
The parking lot is sometimes jam packed with loads of bikes.
Definitely worth a stop.
In Koyasan, [this parking lot](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Kongobuji+Parking+Lot/@34.2135687,135.5863003,16.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x8042bf3c7b2c8f59!8m2!3d34.2129023!4d135.5837546?hl=en&amp;authuser=0&amp;shorturl=1) has free parking for motorcycles.
Definitely park and walk around a bit.
My understanding with the ETC card is that it'll rack up charges as I drive, and when I get back to the shop I'll have to pay what was added to the card in cash to the shop.
I may have misunderstood it though?
Good suggestion on the route, I'm pretty pumped for it.
Would you say it's worth doing the full route down to Ryujin, or it's going to be just fine pulling off that stretch half way?
Haven't asked, what did/do you ride in Japan yourself?
It's possible things have changed, it's been years since I've needed a prepaid ETC card.
It used to be that the only option was a prepaid card.
Definitely suggest hitting all of 371 down to Ryujin.
I have ridden 3 different bikes here.
A CB1000, two CB1300s, and my current bike is what you know as the FJ-09.
Made an edit to my earlier post, be sure to check it out.
Thank you so much for the advice, it's been extremely helpful.
I figured out if I get rid of the rice field stop, and just back track on the same roads going all the way on the route will come out to 5 hours riding time.
Doable for an eight hour trip with stops and food I'd imagine.
I have a good friend who rides the FJ-09, he's in love with that bike.
A bit tall for my fit.
Not much to add to /u/dmizer 's comment.
There's not much on the way down to Ryujin except for the road itself, so if you're tight for time you can turn back at any point.
Actually, I do have one thing to add.
As far as I remember, after Mt.
Koya there's very few places to get food, water or petrol except the Mt.
Gomadan rest stop (the Gomadan sky tower, no petrol).
I've not ridden the return leg of your routes so maybe there's a bit more in there.
Countryside petrol stations may not be open on weekends!
Oh, good call on the food and gas.
Might want to try a prepare a pack lunch picnic to enjoy on a pull off of the road somewhere.

I actually was looking at riding to Mt.
