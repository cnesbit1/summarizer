Talk about your day.
Anything goes, but subreddit rules still apply.
Please be polite to each other!
so i told my parents about my gf.
but i didnt really tell them that she's my gf but instead told them that ive been seeing her for awhile now.
showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went "huh she's so ugly" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices.
also told me that she planning to make me meet her friend's daughter who she deem is prettier.
I feel so offended but whatever.
smh.
If u daring enough.
U could always go with the "who is the Groom?
You or her.
If she like the other girl then ask her to marry her lah."
*note this is likely to be a suicide mission so results may vary.
That's quite rude...
i just went like yeah okay (wtv) with the stuff she said.
Good lord that must have stung.
tell your mum shes already your gf.
Your mom's Savage.
But if you're not in it for the eye candy then it doesn't matter.
Otherwise, maybe she's right.
Your mum savage AF sia...
hmm if this is your first relationship I think parents tend not to take you so seriously the first time you tell her about it.
the very first time I told my parents I was dating someone, they were adamant on emphasizing (like your mum) that it’s ok to date but I should keep an open mind for more options later.
as in telling me to date lightly as well.
but they didn’t say those things anymore when they realized my relationship became serious!
I think your mum just needs some time to adjust?
Asian parents are always unintentionally offensive and hurtful with their weird mindsets lol.

Huh.
Usually what I hear is the mum asking if the girl is blind cos who would want their son.
nah m8.
we're tgt for almost 5months now.
well i really do hope so.
i probs wont mention anything abt it anymore unless she asks next time.
yeah i actually dk why she wants me too.
*cries in laughter*
[well](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/97abgn/both_men_and_women_pursue_partners_who_are_on/#e46piua)...
Anyone think there should be a NS sub Reddit or at least a sticky here?
Easier than creating threads every few months.
Not sure if it's in the sidebar because I'm on mobile.
there is a limit to the number (2) of stickies you can have on a subreddit.
Man that sucks, remove the other sticky or ask Reddit to make an exception?
&gt; ask Reddit to make an exception?
....i dont know how to say this in a nicer way but..who do you think we are?
The tiny nation nobody cares about :(
I think he meant in a "maybe we can write in" kind of way?
I care if it counts :(
I mean, if huge subs can't do it, I doubt /r/singapore could.
/u/infinitus_ what’s your stand on this with reference to /r/sgexams?
do you think there’s a need for it!
That man owns r/sgnationalservice.
