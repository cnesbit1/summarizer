Original Response: 
Hi All, Anthony Vapes back here with my review of the Asmodus C4 RDA, please see the bottom for disclaimers and links.
Note: This is the retail version.
##Introduction:
 
 
The Asmodus C4 RDA is the latest RDAs from longtime manufacturer asmodus.
They don’t get a lot of hype around forums but quietly make some really nice products.
I’ve reviewed quite a few of their mods like the pumper 18, minikin 2, minikin boost kodama, and minikin reborn but this is the first atomizer from them i’ve reviewed.
The C4 RDA is a Single coil DTL RDA with an included squonk pin.
It’s available in 8 colors SS, Black, Blue, Green, Grey, Purple, Red and Gold.
They sell on the official site for 34.95 not too bad but the cheapest i seen is elementvape at 23.95 which is cheaper then the ECC show price they had of 25 USD.

##Initial Impressions and features
 
When I first got this RDA, It was based on a recommendation of a buddy of mine.
He wanted me to buy him a C4 at ECC for the show price because he loves his and wanted a 2nd in a different color.
They also make a green color which is rare and i love green so i was going to buy one for each of us.
Anyway they wound up giving it to me free to review but i still got the green i wanted.
I’m not a fan of the little plastic tube packaging though but it’s nice for space saving but annoying to pull out accessories.
The RDA itself however looked pretty nice.
It reminded me of the flave RDA but with a better deck and a recurve like airflow outside.
It’s kind of a combination of the flave, wasp nano, and recurve in a sense.
Overall I was pretty happy with it from the start.
##Build Deck and Wicking (pics above)
 
Let’s talk about the build deck now.
It’s a pretty basic deck.
It’s a single coil RDA that has a similar deck to the wasp anno where there are 2 posts 1 on each side (one negative one positive) so you have to build your coil with leads going in the opposite direction.
It’s super easy to build on just slide the leads in the cut out and tighten down.
The deck itself also has guide notches to line up the coil where you slide your coil bar with the coil on it making it really easy to line up.
The post screws come top down so it won’t bend your leads with flat wires like fused claptons but also work great with round wire as well.
The post screws themselves are great quality hex screws my personal favorite.
The negative post milled into the deck as well.
Overall an excellent build deck that is really easy to build on even for beginners.
Wicking on it is quite easy.
It’s an RDA so nothing fancy just drop your leads to the bottom.
##Performance

Performance wise, I used it as a Single Coil RDA only.
I ran 4 builds in this a fancy 3mm ID build, a fancy 3.5 mm ID build, a fancy 4mm ID build and 1 simple round 4mm ID build.
For size I found it best with a 4mm ID and plenty of wraps.
The flavor is great one of the better single coil RDAs for sure but really works best with the 4mm ID coils especially the fancy ones.
Simple round works good as well but for that it’s better to close off 1 row of the air holes.
Overall very good performance for a single coil RDA 


 
##Overall Impressions, Details, and Extras
 
Let’s talk about the airflow now.
It has side airflow 9 small holes on each side 3 rows of 3 that gets closed off 3 at a time.
It’s a basic side airflow RDA where the air cuts through the posts like a wasp nano or recurve.
The AFC is nice and smooth and easy to adjust.
You just spin the whole top cap to adjust the air and it’s on a stopper as well.
Really well done and i love that style of airflow adjust.
It comes with 2 standard 810 o-ring drip tips one is a resin tip and the other a black delrin tip.
While I like both i was kind of surprised the green came with a blue/purple resin tip.
It should have been a matching green resin tip.
It does not come with a 510 adapter.
The Drip tips both fit very well in the RDA.
snug, not loose, not tight.
You can use your own as well but they need to be o-ring.
Friction fit 81o tips won’t work in this.
The quality on the Asmodus C4 RDA is excellent.
The o-rings for the top cap onto the base feel right and the top cap is snug but not tight.
Very easy to take apart with no issues.
The AFC is easy to adjust, the o-rings fit just right and everything is nicely done.
The top cap also lock into place which makes it easy to get on and off mods.
The post screws are great quality as well and 2 spare screws are included.
It comes with a standard 510 pin and a BF 510 pin like most RDAs these days.
The juice well is a good size.
Not massive but pretty large.
Especially for a single coil RDA.
The over squonk protection and Over drip protection is pretty good.
Nothing special but good.
It also works well as a dripper.
You can drip right down the drip tip without taking off the top cap.
It’s a 24mm diameter so should not overhang on most mods on the market today.
There is plenty of spare o-rings and 2 spare post screws  for it, 2 allen wrenches (one for the post screws and one for the 510 pin), 2 coils, no cotton.
Good amount of accessories overall.
Some cotton and a 510 drip tip adapter would have been nice though.
They also mostly label the coils which is good.
Companies should always label the included coils.
They are triple fused clapton (26x3+38) 3mm ID .2 ohms each.
No ID label or material though.
Not worried about the ID but they should label the material.
Branding is excellent as in there is none on the outside.
No logos or anything.
Not a big fan of branding that sticks out so quite happy with that.
It’s a great looking RDA.
##Pros: 
 
* 2 Standard 810 Drip Tips (resin and delrin)
* standard 510 pin and squonk pin included
* plenty of spare o-rings
* Color Options (love the green option)
* great quality hex grub post screws included (4 total)
* Good over squonk protection
* Top cap locks in place

* great flavor
* simple looks and branding
* AFC is easy to adjust
* great easy to use build deck

##Cons:
 
* no 510 adapter for drip tips
* only o-ring drip tips will work, no friction fit
* included coils didn’t label the material
* green color comes with a blue resin tip.
Should have been matching.
##Conclusion
 
So with all that said, do I recommend this RDA?I don’t like to do a hard yes or no, but this one will lean pretty heavily towards the yes.
Overall it’s one of the best single coil RDAs i’ve reviewed this year.
It’s easy to build on, doesn't need a fancy build but really shines with them.
Good juice well, works as a dripper and a squonker.
Really no major complaints at all from me.
A 510 tip would have been nice and a matching resin tip for the green.
It’s a great performer and at under 25 USD well worth a buy.
I’ve added this to my sheet of recs linked down below.
This is Anthony Vapes just keeping it honest, hopefully you all can say the same and i’ll catch you on my next review.

I've had my eye on this one for a while, I think you just pushed me over the edge here lol.
I think the blue looks fantastic.
thanks!
and happy to help and yeah all the colors look great but i'm happy to have a green RDA.
those are pretty rare.
Yeah the green looks awesome as well, and is more rare, but it is "Ships in 7 days" on FT, vs in stock for the blue.
And we all know what "ships in 7 days" means.
LMAO it means 7 days to 7 years :)

it's actually 10 bucks cheaper at elementvape and they are in the US and they have green, blue, purple, and gold in stock and you'll have it in under a week :)
Thanks for the heads up!
I would have checked vape crawler before buying but you saved me the trouble.
Green incoming lol, crazy good deal on that at element.
Lmao yup no prob man.
Good to know a 4mm works best as well, I figured it would based on pics but nice to have your results.
Gonna slap a quad fused 30gx4/40g spaced 316l build when it gets in.
I'll let you know my thoughts once I get around to trying it.
sounds good!
i look forward to hearing it.
You ever get a chance to try the dpro mini btw?
Also have my eye on that one.
never got one of those for some reason.
Not sure why as i've gotten all their other stuff before and after that one.
Looks like a solid single coiler too, postless but easy looking deck, should be squonk and overdrip friendly as well.
yeah looks pretty good.
I didn't care for the dual coil one but should work better in a smaller single coil set up.
Damn almost 8 bucks shipping from element lol.
Quite steep to ship such a small thing heh.
I think when I shipped you that tripple V2 it cost me 2.75 ;)
LMAO that's the cheapest option?
that's kinda insane to ship a single RDA.
hell you could priory flat rate it for like 6 bucks.
Yeah, makes it pretty much the same price as from vapordna or fasttech, kind of sneaky to charge so much shipping to make up for the great price.
yeah odd indeed.
I've never placed an order with any site really that i didn't reach the free shipping threshold.
I usually buy multiple items or tack on some juice to get free shipping LMAO ironic since i pay 7 bucks to ship out free shit to people so often.

It’s a great looking RDA.
