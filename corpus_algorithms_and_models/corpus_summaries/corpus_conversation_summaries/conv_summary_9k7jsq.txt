The Greens have a decent anti-corruption policy, as does the Pirate Party.
With the ABC network and the Great Barrier Reef grant money both steeped in corruption worth millions all tied to our corrupt government voting Liberal or Labour will make no difference.
Unless the Australian people vote other than these two party’s nothing will change.
Don’t keep rewarding the same two main parties with your vote.
Help Independents and minor parties get a foothold.
Beware of fake progressive parties/independents who are created by the LNP and Labor to funnel preferences to themselves.
Are those parties hierarchical?
If so then we're SOL.
Very flat, and probably not hard to climb.
I've been to a few Greens events with friends much more active than myself, and it seems to me that the power is mainly held by people with some combination of activity on behalf of the party (such as candidacy, or organizational activity), and time spent doing these activities.
The most powerful in the party seem to be the ones who have succeeded in getting elected to positions, understandably so as this is the most important result for the party.
Write to your MP!
I sent an email to my local Federal MP this morning.
To find your MP, use the search at the bottom of this link: [https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators\_and\_Members/Guidelines\_for\_Contacting\_Senators\_and\_Members](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Guidelines_for_Contacting_Senators_and_Members)

Then send them an email identifying the law / amendment before parliament and your concerns surrounding the amendment.
Make it clear to the MP would position you want them to take.
Nice idea, but my local MP is Tony fucking Pasin, so I have exactly zero chance of being listened to, because I don't have large amounts of money to give him.
Join a political party that should most align to your beliefs.
Campaign for change for things that you know are right and just.
