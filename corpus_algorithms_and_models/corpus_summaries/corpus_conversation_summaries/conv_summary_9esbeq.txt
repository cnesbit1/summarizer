This shows amazing research by a group starting in 2004 with discovery that mammals have stem cells in their ovaries, original study done in mice

In 2012 they were able to take a human ovary and discover stem cells capable of producing NEW eggs in human females.
They were also able to remove the stem cells and grow eggs outside of the human body from the stem cells.
In 2017 they proved that not only eggs are lost but they are also partially repleted by stem cells breaking all original thought that we are born with the same number of eggs and we loose them until menopause.
The issue actually seems to be in the fact that ovarian environment can not support the egg growth, not just egg death.
This gives rise to the possibilities that they can take a biopsy of an ovary, remove the stem cells and grow brand new eggs at any age as they have proved that even women in menapause have these stem cells, they are just inactive.
Then, we can use IVF to fertilize that brand new egg to make an embryo.
Therefore this could revolutionize how and what IVF and infertility are known as today as well as how long we think our window of fertility lasts.

Fascinating to me!

Ever heard of over population?
I know right.
I hate to be that guy, but we're at 7.6 billion humans and at a crisis point where our environment changes will become irreversible.
You'd think we'd be investing into technology to help prevent this crisis point and save our planet and the animals on it - but nope, we've discovered a new way to put more humans on the planet, who in turn will need feeding, clothing and raising with resources that are becoming increasingly harder to sustain.
It‚Äôs not about over population as much as helping those who can‚Äôt have children due to cancer, ovarian failure, those currently needing IVF and going through really horrible emotional and physical side effects of IVF - the need is already there.
Those partners who have bad sperm and ruin the woman‚Äôs own ability before they figure out what the issue is and her own fertility is compromised / as happens in 50% cases of infertility for example.
There are so many benefits.
Adding more people.
Nothing about having kids purposefully is anything less than selfish.
All reasons will start with ‚ÄúI want‚Äù.
Technology can improve but not necessarily for greater good.
Sure.
People shouldn‚Äôt get married or have children on purpose ever.
How selfish of everyone to enjoy family life and be human.
ü§£üôÑ.
Look mate the act is selfish.
General existence is full of selfish acts.
Having kids is one of them (on purpose as you know rape and such exist).
I have pets.
That‚Äôs selfish because I spend a lot on them.
They have good lives but I wanted them.
Full stop.
It doesn‚Äôt mean all strides for general advancement of technology should be used because someone says I want when the population is at 7 billion and growing?
At least be honest about yourself and actions.
The whole idea that having a child because people get married love each other and raise a human being in a loving home to better humanity and contribute to these kind of discoveries and science and helping society is not selfish.
It‚Äôs loving.
It‚Äôs being a human being.
Im sorry something happened in your life for you to believe otherwise.
If you believe what you said you would just have NO one have children and all humans should actually die off after this generation because we don‚Äôt deserve to be alive bc if everyone makes a child we are too selfish to live.
If NOT then it‚Äôs ok to have a child.
If it‚Äôs ok to have a child why is it ok that some people have children and not others.
Sorry but I‚Äôll agree to disagree with your view, and no I won‚Äôt downvote your different view from mine.

Who do you think is going to be working and contributing to the economy and taking care of your decrepit ass when you're 85?
Children being born today.
Replacing the population is actually incredibly important demographically and economically.
[removed]
No duh.
People who enter those fields.
Not as an obligation.
The infinite growth model is not sustainable really.
The population should decrease and economy adjust in a better system.
Unfortunately it is currently a sort of pyramid scheme of infinite people taking care of their predecessors‚Äô generations.
There will be no "people who enter those fields" if people now do not reproduce and replace the current population.
Replacing the existing population is not infinite growth and it is necessary for our society to continue functioning.
We might as well say your choice to continue living is selfish.
[removed]
I did say general existence is.
So yep.
I like living generally.
At 7 billions replacement rate is still not a good solution in my opinion.

[removed]
Then you must admit you know nothing about demographics or economics.

I do have a general idea.
The current system is not set up to account for a decline in population as a whole and increase in aging populations.
It needs restructuring bad.
I‚Äôm not touting to have the answer but I can see a problem enough to not find HAVE BABIES as the sole solution.
If people stopped having kids, that would be disastrous.
The solution to a changing economic scale is not endless babies.
Again I don‚Äôt have it but restructuring is needed.
Well, the ivory tower folk are petrified of violence so we are definitely going to get to about 15 billion in your lifetime.
