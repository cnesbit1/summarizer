Original Response: 
I\`m looking for a Espurr with it\`s hidden ability (Own Tempo) I\`m willing to trade for any of the gen 2 or 7 starters, Gligar or Froakie with their hidden ability.
hello, i have a meowstic with its hidden ability, i can breed it for you if you are willing to trade.
if you have any of these pokemon, i am willing to trade:

Bulbasaur (Chlorophyll)
Totodile (Rain Dish)
Treecko (Unburden)
Mudkip (Damp)
Turtwig (Shell Armor)
Chimchar (Iron Fist)
Piplup (Defiant)
Chespin (Bulletproof)
Fennekin (Magician)
Totodiles hidden ability is sheer force, did you mean it with sheer force or squirtle with rain dish?
I have HA totodile but not squirtle.
yeah, i meant sheer force.
sorry for the misunderstanding.
ok I can breed you the totodile.
send me a message when you're ready, i'll be in the festival plaza.
ok ready, sent the request.
Can you send the request again?
I was doing a global challenge.
Make sure you are connected to the Internet as well.
Oh right, I was confused.
do you have the totodile with you?
I thought I traded it to you before.
You didn't, I really don't have it.
didn\`t you trade it for the egg?
No...
The espurr I'm showing is the only one I hatched :(
Can you breed another one?
This is definitely an own tempo espurr, you can check it.
strange, I  guess I\`ll have to breed another.
Don't worry, I can wait.
You'll know its me if my name has friends list next to it.
Thanks for the trade.
No worries, sorry about that first totodile.

Summary: 
do you have the totodile with you?
