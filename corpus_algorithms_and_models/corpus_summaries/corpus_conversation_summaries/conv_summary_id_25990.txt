Did... Did she eat the crust first?
Is this a pizza hut stuffed crust commercial?
Those Brits, no wonder they lost the war.
Nah, she’s doing ratio-styled eating.
You take smaller bites of the most delicious part of a thing so you can take another little bite of the least tasty part.
Here she is demonstrating getting a small bite of cheese, maybe a corner of a pepperoni, and then a small bite of crust so she gets the most pizza experience possible without a situation where she ends up having to eat most of the crust alone, or throw it away.It’s an art.
Upopulair opinion: I like to eat the crust of a pizza.

Summary: 
Nah, she’s doing ratio-styled eating.
