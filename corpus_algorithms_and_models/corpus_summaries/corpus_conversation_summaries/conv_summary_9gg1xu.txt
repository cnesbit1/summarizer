I knew what this was gonna be and I still clicked it.
I'm so sad.
Sorry, man.
At least your team didn't get Gretzky and still not win a cup!
I had to check the flair to see which team you were talking about.
Alexa, play despacito.

Nice multi-team burn.
In fact, i'd say he lost it.
Hey man, at least your ownership didn’t force your GM to call Gretzky at 2am to finish the deal, thus ensuring the great one never played for your team.
Like every great song has a duel meaning, every great burn does the same.
I'm sorry I laughed at your pain.
At least your team didn't have Mike Keenan who was a complete dick to the point that Gretzky left them because of that

Ah wait.
This is your daily reminder that Mike Keenan is a shitbag.
Or that he purposely benched Dale Hawerchuk when his ill grandma was watching him for the last time.

Don’t worry, Yzerman picked it up.
Don't worry, at least you guys got another well-loved player from the Oilers dynasty.

Brett Hull claims when Dale Hawerchuk was a Blue in like 96 or something, they were playing in Buffalo and his sick grandma was going to watch him for the last time.
For some reason he must of pissed off Keenan but he sat him out during that game so she couldn't watch him play

Brett Hull got so pissed off and exploded at him, at costed him the C.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine!

I'm sorry I laughed at your pain.
