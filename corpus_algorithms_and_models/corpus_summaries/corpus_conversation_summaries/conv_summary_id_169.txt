Original Response: 
which place is the best for an adult learner?
Most places its around $50-55 an hour.
Should I just find some random stranger and pay him less to save money?
I'll teach you how to drive!
PM me if you're serious.
I could use some extra cash and won't charge $50 an hour :)

Disregard what I said!

Good luck!
Yes definitely just find a friend that'll teach you.
And learn stick!
And learn how to drive on sand, so you don't get stuck like a tourist :)
Agreed!
Stick is just too much fun...
