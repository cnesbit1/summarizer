“In Bitcoin since 2010” would make unemployment an irrelevance.
Yea most old crypto people don't need to work jobs anymore lol.
Not really accurate.
Bought btc at $1 for the first time.
Lost it all on sr when it got seized.
Lots of other people bought at whatever, $.0.30 or $5 or whatever and sold at $100 or sold after the first big crash.
Or sold after 200% returns.
Most early adopters didn't have the foresight to hold tons of btc to the thousands.
Yes exactly.
I once spent hundreds of bitcoins to someone to get a computer kit shipped to me.
I basically got the computer kit for free, but like at the time I was like wow that's cool I made couple hundred bucks, not oh shoot let me buy back so I can make millions.

What is sr?
Probably silk ro@d.
Silk Road.
The only time btc has effectively used as currency, Silk Road was shit down but other markets continue to this day.
silk road.
I've been following it from the early days but never bought in...

:(
I made about 145k from Bitcoin and Ripple.
It's nothing to sneezed at but I'm never going to be living large for the rest of my life on that kind of money.

If your money is held in escrow on a black market drug website, you’re gonna have a bad time

You’re not smarter than the attorneys at the FBI and what you think is or isn’t “egregious” doesn’t matter.
It is still NOT legal in Holland to possess weed in any quantities unfortunately,its still full on in the Opiumlaw as being punishable.In practise its sort of allowed to have less then 5 grams as a person.
Coffeeshop where they sell softdrugs exist because of the toleration policy,This will change in the future.So yes in theory you could be prosecuted  for this purchase on SR etc.
I hear you, very few people have the balls to buy something even at $100 per piece and not sell it at $500 or $1000.
A friend of mine was telling me back in 2008 to buy computers and start generating this digital coin that suppose to increase its value in time.
Of course I said this was another internet scam and missed that opp, but let's say we did start to mine Bitcoin when it was about $10 per coin I don't think I would hold it until now.
I know someone mining ETH Classic and he has shitloads....what he did is put them in a wallet and locked it with some software for 2 years.
I guess nowadays it's easier to think long term when you know what happened the last 10 years.
They don’t have to be smart anyways since they can use civil forfeiture.
I'm not american but the FBI took my btc lol.
It was held in escrow, if I was smarter I'd have kept it on my offline wallet but at the time it was only like $50 (and then $5000, and then $20 000, but literally a few days later the site and all the btc was seized) so I didn't really care, plus I was spending it so it made sense then.
They took all the btc held on sr wallets, 'legal' or not, so yes: you, me, and everyone else lost all the btc held on sr.
That is like taking the wallets from all ebay customers (including international) because there are one or more illegal merchants on the platform.
Leave it to the US to implement global civil asset forfeiture.
Hi fellow dutchy, what i also wonder is, bitcoin isn’t controlled by the government or banks so isn’t it incredibly hard to seize bitcoin especially from individuals?
Foremost bitcoin is very anonymous and secondly you can just memorize your private key, say you lost it and no one will ever be able to get to your bitcoin.
Yes if something get’s raided and there’s bitcoins stored found locally or the info to get to it but otherwise i don’t see how it’s done.
Or is it people that have wallets on some app/website from a company and the gov just tells the company to hand it over?
Yeah it wouldnt matter if you are unemployed or not because noone would hire someone dumb enough to buy buttcoin, cant wait for this bubble to pop and yall being poor like u used to be.
SR provided a custodial wallet at the time.
That is why 'not your keys, not your bitcoin' applies in this case.
“In Bitcoin since 2005” would sound even bette.
Back in 2008?
Was your friend's name Satoshi?
Hahahah, must've been right?
Don't really remember what year it was, just that it was worth about $10.
Never took advantage of that opportunity anyway, so it doesn't matter.
Thanks for your input.
Well I read the bitcoin paper one week after it was released, but haven't bought any bitcoins aside from a few for spending which I promptly did.
And when the remaining ~0.4 bitcoins turned into 50 dollars I spend those too.
Life as a minor is hard.
Ah thx.
Can confirm.

Only teasing.
I also remember hearing about bitcoin way back when it was worth very little, even vaguely remember visiting a faucet site and giving up after like ten minutes trying to work out what was going on.
Then coming back towards the end of 2013 and thinking.......shit.
Missed opportunities!
A lot of old crypto people are DNM users who actually spent BTC.
I paid $1,000s in NewEgg purchases when they introduced BTC discounts.
Figured it might dump in value since it was worth $300.
I did that too a few years later.
I was like I keep losing money in this shit, so when i bought I think at $200 i was like fuck this im spending on newegg or tigerdirect before i lose money.
All honesty I dont really have a good timeline remembered lol.
I can probably find that transaction tho.
I don't think we should feel sorry about it, there are many other "great" opportunities I've come across during the last 15 years and none of them is here.
I think we're still in the game at the right time and if we focus on the long term we'll do great.

Summary: 
I made about 145k from Bitcoin and Ripple.
I did that too a few years later.
