Original Response: 
My family goes to Port Aransas in September, but I heard they're still rebuilding from Harvey.
Will Port Aransas have recovered enough by then?
I heard the places to stay are still closed.
Port A is in good shape now, most restaurants and hotels are open.
There are a handful that are still closed and being repaired.
We have come a long way, and they are still tearing down some houses.
The beaches and fishing here have never been better.
Where do y'all normally stay and/or visit and I can tell you if they are open.
Lots of places are back open, just start calling and you should be able to make your reservations somewhere.
Pretty amazing how much work has been done there.
Like the others have said, most of the places are open and functional.
I know  Port A would love to have you--the local economy needs it.
We stay at Island Dunes.
They are still under repairs, but by September they will be close to being done.
Keep up with their Facebook page for updates.
Have you asked the place you are staying at?
It seems they might be the best source of correct information.
If you can get past the raiders and the Super Muntants.
