Original Response: 
I don't have a ride to the airport, but is there a bus that can take me there?
Would I have to call a taxi and how much would that cost?
When do you need to get there?
Pretty sure a bus doesn't stop there but you could catch a bus to a hotel that has a shuttle and pretend to be a guest.
Or perhaps one of us is available to give you a ride.
CAll green n go cab, and ask their fare.
Airport used to be $20 flat fee.
Don't know if it still applies.
I know that there was one lyft driver around.
