&gt; I have my 20th anniversary meloetta up for trade so was wondering :)

Once again, you need to disclose all of the required information (Rule 3) when offering.
Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) before posting and reply to me with this information.

What do you mean by this?
This doesn't tell me the details required by Rule 3B.

Are you certain that it is not hacked and/or cloned by our policy?
If so, how?
Can you provide a link to the trade?

&gt; I Have the WC proof of it.
That doesn't mean anything.
Again, "Can you provide a link to the trade?"

It doesn't matter if you will "leave the trade."
You can still provide a screenshot of the private messages.

If you don't want to comply, then don't offer/trade this Meloetta here again as per Rule 2.
Unfortunately, if you are unsure of a Pok√©mon's legitimacy, it cannot be traded here.
Again, the Wonder Card does not mean anything and it certainly does not mean it is legitimate.
I suggest you read and follow the rules if you don't want us to "harass" you.
