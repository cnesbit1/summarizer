It honestly wouldn't surprise me if more than 11 million Bitcoin are lost forever.
10 Million circulating supply is what I expect once hyperbitcoinization happens.
True, when I die my bitcoins will die with me.

Accumulate until crysis.
Others will accumulate from you later for higher price :D.
Yes, people needs to work for bitcoin, not giving it away for free, even for relatives.
Unless I could sell it at 100k lol.
Truth.
Someone gains fiat everytime someone loses it.

Truth, if I sold you my Bitcoin at $19,000 I gained your fiat and you lost it.
Your BANK gained it, they'll just allow you to use it eventually, with some rules and for that amount they'll probably ask you why and where it comes from.

Theory still stands.
His self gained fiat while also giving it.
Incidentally, the same is true for the crypto.
Gained and given, but out of phase from fiat.

‚òùthis person gets it.
False in the sense that you have just undermined the fundamentals of economic theory?

i mined in the old days on my laptop over 10.000 bitcoins in like 2 hours

then i said fuck this my laptop is getting hot with this shit and then reformatted to install a new distro probably a few months later and didn't even bother to back them coins up

i guess like you said many millions of bitcoins are lost forever.

Summary: 
Gained and given, but out of phase from fiat.
True, when I die my bitcoins will die with me.
