Original Response: 
&gt;...he publicly posted a recording of a class in which she detailed being raped in a publicly available Dropbox.
The letter describes this action as “reprehensible” and states that when he was asked to remove the posting by the university he instead asked his Twitter followers to “make copies to preserve the audio recordings online."
What a piece of shit.
Edit: the lengths people in this thread are willing to go to try and defend this grown edgelord are insane.
Full blown tinfoil hat shit, straight up fabrications.
Anything to try and be "right" eh?
Yeah, that is pretty horrific.
[deleted]
He records and uploads all his classes.
An activist student, who had been gunning for him to be fired for his position on First Nations, for no reason relevant to the discussion spoke in front of a room full of people about her having an Aziz Ansari type of "rape" during one of his classes.
As someone who was actually brutally beaten unconscious and raped in my youth it infuriates the fuck out of me to see these low life pieces of shit exploiting the very serious issue of rape for the sole reason of getting someone fired, fuck her she's a piece of shit.
&gt; An activist student, who had been gunning for him to be fired for his position on First Nations, for no reason relevant to the discussion spoke in front of a room full of people about her having an Aziz Ansari type of "rape" during one of his classes.
Is this true?
This cannot be true, come on?

Why are you spreading conspiracy theories?
If this woman did not approve of the recording, then I have no sympathy for his firing.
If you personally, as a rape survivor, want to have your story forever recorded online for any person to hear it and also have it associated with your name, that is fine.
You make that choice for yourself.
Not her.
Should she perhaps not have told her story to a group of people and expected privacy?
Sure.
But his employer asked him to take it down, which seems like something easy to comply with, and instead he maliciously complied.
Then the university fired him.
I am fine with all of this.
He did not commit a crime.
Her story was bullshit and the only reason she vocalized it in his class was because she knew his classes were uploaded publicly and after a year of unsuccessfully trying to get him fired it worked.
Fuck her, she exploited rape for her personal benefit and agenda that is inexcusable.
[removed]
Have you ever worked an actual job?
If your employer asks you to do something and you work around it in an oh so sly way, you will get canned.
This is real life for fucks sake.
Why are people surprised by this.
She purposely shared it publicly because she knew it was going to be uploaded as had every single other class of his she had ever attended.
You're dumber than Donald Trump and Doug Ford combined if you can't see how blatantly obvious this set up is.
Why are you lying about being assaulted?
"This professor is reprehensible for not being extremely sympathetic to a rape survivor, so let me show just how wrong this professor was by being completely unsympathetic to a rape survivor!"
Really?
Practice what you preach.
I do think someone who went through the same experience would have a better perspective on the matter, and how victims deal with it, than you would.
If the professor does indeed record and upload all of their classes, that is very different than the information we're given here.
Recording and uploading all of your classes?
Well standard practice that his students know about and were informed about before hand.
If there's something you don't want recorded, don't talk about it.
Pretty simple.
Him secretly recording just this girl talking about her experience with sexual assault, and uploading it, when that's not standard class practice, is extremely shitty, and a fireable offence.
If anyone doesn't agree with that, I don't think they're looking at this rationally.
[deleted]
Read the actual letter and not the vice article.
He was posting all his lectures online.
He didn't just secretly record the woman speaking and post it online.
There are definitely some privacy concerns, but Vice is spinning the narrative.
While I agree with you that the woman's actions were probably propelled by political motivation, this man took a principled stance that all things should be shared online.
I fundamentally disagree with that, and think that it would have been very easy for him to cut her story out of his recording.
Snip snip and the story is gone.
I dont necessarily disagree with his platform just his podium.
If you want your side to appear more rational than the otherside, sometimes you need to eat crow and back down on principled stances in favor of realistic ones, like the backlash that will obviously ensue when you refuse to remove someone's sexual assault details from your recording.
If this was truly worth it to him, I also support that decision.
Sure.
Cut the 5 minutes from the recording and get the admin to bar her from his class.
&gt; the part where you paraphrase my comments, despite being really fucking short

you didn't need to infer from what i'd said, and what i said was way the fuck different from your further bullshit

this isn't about 'extremely sympathetic', or any dumb pretenses

and is in fact about how this shit professor was pretentious, and was fired for being really fucking pretentious

&gt; if anyone doesn't agree with that, i don't think they're looking at this rationally

or you're avoiding a lot of in-context conversation to so your simplified perspective can justify not having fired this guy.
Even if recording every class was standard practice (which no one has provided proof of) I think students should have the right to remove sensitive material from such recordings without their middle aged professor going full edgelord on them.
I think that's a reasonable request.
I just stated I was publicly therefore you can not question me.
So every student should be able to get them to go back and edit the class recording at their whim because they brought something up they didn't want heard, even though they knew the class was recorded and uploaded?
Have you been to a university?
Since when do any professors go out of their way to do that type of extra work for students.
[deleted]
So the defense is that professors are so shitty anyway, let's keep them for being shitty because it's expected behaviour?
She can say that all she wants, but if he took the official channel and banned her through the administration, he wouldnt be fired.
Sure, every professor should record themselves.
Not necessarily upload the entirety of it online.
Yeah it works differently for tenured profs; they are extremely hard to fire, and this guy has a decent shot at getting his job back or a fat settlement.
[deleted]
Lol, I don't think you understand what paraphrasing is.
I was merely pointing out that you're acting pretty much exactly like the professor who's actions you're so upset about.
Being an asshole to a rape victim (allegedly in the professors case, plain to see in your comment).
So yeah, go ahead and get up on your moral high horse after doing that buddy.
Why's it wrong when he does it, but it's fine for you to do?
I'm not saying he was or wasn't justifiably fired.
I'm pointing out two different scenarios, one where I would support him being fired, and one where I wouldn't.
If he does record and upload all of his classes, that's for sure relevant information, and shouldn't be omitted in the reporting.
Imagine getting so riled up that someone was an asshole to a rape victim, that you go out and be an asshole to a rape victim.
How does that make sense to you?
I don’t feel like this is the argument the guy I’m responding to is making.
He seems to be saying that it was unfair for him to be fired.
To me this is fireable even if he gets rehired because he has great job protection.
You called her story bullshit why cant I call yours.
Read the letter from the university.
It says it clearly there that he was uploading all his lectures.
Vice purposely misrepresented things.
You don't see the irony in calling bullshit on this other person's rape story?
If he records it, and someone lies to defame him, he can sue.
The defense is that these people knew the classes were recorded and uploaded.
If you go on national tv, and say something you're embarrassed of after the fact, should you be able to go and get them to edit it and not let them put it on tv?
If yes?
Really?
If no?
How's this different?
Both times, you're informed beforehand that this is going to be published somewhere.
And no, I don't think professors, who aren't trained to use software, should have to spend potentially hours of their free time to edit class recordings after the fact.
They teach classes, they grade papers, the do research, and attend conferences.
They are not paid to sit in their office and edit class recordings.
Class recordings are a favour to students who miss class, or take notes slowly, so they don't miss out on relevant information and learning.
Teachers shouldn't be punished with extra work for doing their class a favour.
I loved with my profs put recordings of classes online, made studying so much easier.
For most jobs, you'd be right.
With tenure, so long as you do the basic duties of a prof and don't break the law, you can't be fired.
I find it hard to believe the administration's claim that 90% of his lectures were off-topic since he would have to be straying from *his own* syllabus that he wrote.
[removed]
It's easy to keep the entire recording to yourself and release it to news organizations if asked about it to verify your side.
It's not hard at all.
If you have a recording, and somebody is lying in a way that is provably false by said recording, you will win.
[deleted]
[deleted]
He knew what the content of the lecture would be when he chose to post it online.
He had every opportunity to plan around the privacy concerns and he callously chose not to.
I don't see that as spinning the narrative.
I guess we will find out.
Does tenure extend to directly subverting an order to remove an audio recording of a class from a public Dropbox?
Surely, there is a limit.
Nothing in your post counters him being a piece of shit for posting a rape story.
Also, the fake rape survivor who complained in the first place could get a bunch of like minded people to tell more bogus rape stories and bog the prof down in pointlessly editing each lecture.
[deleted]
Can you even read?
She is calling bullshit on the Aziz type of rape aka.
Someone misunderstands your cues and then appologizes and nothing happens.
As has been the case with Ansari.
Since I didn't listen/watch the lecture I can't say what the student recollected but going by the post instead.
[removed]
Omitting the fact that he was posting all his lectures to drop box is absolutely spinning the narrative.
I can't take your comment in good faith if you don't see that.
You can argue that his refusal to edit the lecture recording was wrong, but you cannot argue that Vice is giving an honest reporting of events.
I don't understand why you feel this point is so important.
They wrote that he posted "a recording of a class," not "a secret recording of her."
That's all the context necessary, because it really doesn't matter *why* you're outing a rape victim *when you're outing a rape victim.
* Especially when you then direct people to disseminate copies of the recording so that it can never go away after finding out that she's not happy you violated her privacy.
My posts focus is on Vice' s selective omission to manipulate the narrative, and I stand by that claim 100%.
Also a class room is not a private space, everyone is expected to be recording/transcribing everything going on in class.
1) She outed herself.
She has no right to privacy in this situation.
She told her story in a public place.
2) I think the fact that he was posting all his classes online is an important detail.
It makes it very different narrative than the implied one that he did it out of malice towards a rape victim.
[removed]
Look, im sorry, but I know people who take a principled stance in every single action they do, and it has backfired so harshly for their lives.
We're not talking about the law here, we're talking about university policy.
It was reasonable of a student to assume that her professor would be sensitive to the privacy of their students when posting recordings of the class online, and edit out any sensitive or identifying information in the audio.
He was legally in the right, but ethically in the wrong.
It really doesn't change the narrative though, because he did act out of malice.
He knew that there was sensitive information shared during his lecture and that people who feel comfortable sharing something in a classroom environment don't necessarily feel comfortable sharing it on the internet.
When she started to tell her story, he had the opportunity to remind her that she was being recorded and offer to turn the device off temporarily.
He had the opportunity to seek her direct consent before posting the recording right up until the moment he hit "upload."
With that in mind, his choice to leave it in the recording can reasonably be considered an act of malice.
He found out she was not happy about it being posted online, and instead of publishing an edited version of the lecture, he directed others to save copies of the file containing her story.
What possible motivation would he have to do that if he were not acting maliciously?
[removed]
If this even makes it to court, the case will hinge primarily on whether or not he carried out his basic professorial duties.
The allegation that his courses deviated from the syllabus is the most serious one as far as his employment is concerned.
I don’t buy that you can only be fired for not carrying out basic duties unless those basic duties are rather broadly defined.
That article is spun so hard it could be a dradle.
I have no comments on the actual events or the guy's actions, it's just glaringly obvious the thing was written with an agenda in mind.
Edit - let's be honest folks.
The title of the article is misleading, the language is chosen to be inflammatory, the story is represented to fit a narrative.
I don't agree with what the Prof did, but the article is trash.
The university's letter claims he was fired for "privacy breach" and "harassment."
That's not being "bad at your job" in the sense implied by the title.
Vice has gotten worse and worse over the years and has a strong bias expressed through its content.
&gt;  Vice is spinning the narrative

you don't say.
&gt; It makes it very different narrative than the implied one that he did it out of malice towards a rape victim.
I thought the implication was that he kept it up out of malice towards a rape victim, but chose to make it a free speech issue.
SJW is a term designed to be derogatory and cut down a group of people you don't agree with.
If you want to have a productive conversation about this stuff you might want to consider using different language.
Your point seems to be that his actions were above board and respectful, do I have that right?
If that's actually the point you are trying to make, you might want to avoid sarcastic and derogatory language while you do it.
You could easily just call me a snowflake or something, as long as you realize that shows exactly how respectful and above board you are trying to be here.
You're very possibly right, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't have edited out the section.
It's obviously a special situation that requires breaking from habit.
If you are in a position to post a recording of somebody admitting they were sexually assaulted, you should think twice about it.
Because it's an asshole thing to do, and you might rightly lose your job.
&gt; He found out she was not happy about it being posted online, and instead of publishing an edited version of the lecture, he directed others to save copies of the file containing her story.
What possible motivation would he have to do that if he were not acting maliciously?
Thank you for bringing this one up.
All these apologists trying to paint this crap as innocent, yet the Professor's **actions** (speaking louder than words) after the fact betray his fucked up motivations.
That said, she has a right to ask that it be removed and the university can request that classes not be recorded or that portions of classes not be shared.
This is not uncommon and I have seen it happen.
Did you miss the part where he asked students to save the audio and keep it for themselves?
He did it on purpose.
Had to reacted to requests to remove the recordings quickly and respectfully this might be a very different story.
Plus it's incredibly far fetched to think a reasonable person wouldn't know the difference between "Wednesdays lecture on statistics" and "Suzy confessed to being raped today."
He has a duty of care here.
[removed]
Thats not actually how Tenure works.
You can be fired if you refuse to do your job and to comply with basic policies of the university.
He seems to have not only not complied but also to have absolutely refused to change his behaviour.
In that case the university can fire him.
Tenure is not some magic wand that lets you just do whatever you want on the universities time and dime completely absent consequences.
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I find it hard to believe the administration's claim that 90% of his lectures were off-topic since he would have to be straying from *his own* syllabus that he wrote.
His syllabus would need to be approved by his department.
Given that his department would be unlikely to approve a document that contained so little content related to the actual course and was so wildly off topic he would have submitted something to them that was acceptable and would have been in compliance with the expectations for someone teaching that course.
Then after submitting that and having it approved (and distributing the approved syllabus) he would stray wildly from it and do what he wanted to do.
If anything that is easy to see.
You're claiming - without evidence - she was bogus, and defending against a fictional conspiracy where a group of people falsely admit to being raped to deal him death by a thousand cuts as he wastes his life editing audio?
Do I have that right?
The instant this becomes a thing you immediately stop recording class.
That would suck for the rest of the students, but it doesn't actually matter *because none of that actually happened.
*
Nothing I've seen in the letter amounts to anything more than being rude to people.
The only serious allegation is the not doing his job part.
And I seriously doubt he strayed from the syllabus; his students would revolt.
At least, I know I would have if I failed the exams because the prof couldn't stick to the syllabus.
&gt;She knew that he recorded and released all of this lectures.
But did she before hand?
was there a disclaimer up that anything said in the classroom would be recorded, preserved, and shared without their further consent?
Because it is one thing if he was recording himself but it is another to record other people.
If you have ever been anywhere that someone is filming professionally it is very clear that they post up notices of their filming and that if you are in certain locations you may be filmed and that it may be shared.
It is also why producers will get people to sign waivers for things like reality TV shows so that their footage is usable and they wont get sued.
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;She did it so that she could censor him.
Please show evidence that she explicitly told the story of her rape with an intention that he would film it, and refuse to remove it online when a reasonable request was made.
None of that matters.
The lecture is his intellectual property, and the students knew in advance they were going to be published.
That girl had zero expectation of privacy.
The university was WAY out of line telling him what to do with his property.
&gt;Her story was bullshit and the only reason she vocalized it in his class was because she knew his classes were uploaded publicly and after a year of unsuccessfully trying to get him fired it worked.
How can you possibly know her intentions?
I disagree.
University students are adults, and the students knew beforehand everything was going to be recorded and uploaded.
If she didn't want it recorded and uploaded, why talk about it?
Yes.
OMG.
Why didn't he just edit the video after his employer asked him to?
It would have been that easy.
The actions can be interpreted in different ways.
One interpretation is that he felt that the normal operation of the class, in which lectures are posted online, is more important to maintain than having that system disrupted because of a single student's complaints.
Teachers dismiss individual complaints all the time.
"Gimme a higher grade, I'm special" - "No.
", for example.
The voluntary action of a student to spill something personal in class is not enough grounds to disrupt the system.
The remainder of that lecture can contain important material for study/review for everyone else.
Of course, the ideal would be to edit it out and make everyone happy, but I can understand if the prof considers that more effort than necessary.
&gt; The only serious allegation is the not doing his job part.
and that is the only part that matters.
He didnt do his job, and refused to do it, so he was fired.
That is how the world works.
&gt; And I seriously doubt he strayed from the syllabus; his students would revolt.
The reason for starting the investigation was that students were complaining (as per previous reporting) that he was not teaching the class to the syllabus that was distributed.
But after she asked him to take it down?
So the department--which has taken the legally risky move of firing a tenured prof--claims.
We'll just have to wait and see how this plays out.
&gt; They should if they're daring to go against the SJWs of the university.
Otherwise SJWs will make up stuff and claim that he said stuff in lectures that he never did.
Holy smokes.
The mental gymnastics on display here are gold medal worthy.
Did you really just compare someone asking not to have details of their rape shared online to someone who says "give me a better grade because I'm special"?
[removed]
&gt; She did it so that she could censor him.
Source?
They have a legal department and a large number of experienced lawyers who would review this type of action prior to his firing.
Universities are not unlike big corporations in that way.
They work hard to avoid being in a position where they can be sued, this is especially the case in high profile situations like this.
Considering that they fired him, I would say that the likely outcome is that they have sufficient evidence of his failure to do his job and to comply with university policy to believe they can legally fire him for it and that it was thoroughly reviewed by their lawyers prior to them taking action.
He will play victim and fight it im sure but I highly doubt he will win.
&amp;#x200B;

As you say, we will just need to wait and see how it plays out, though my money is on he stays fired.
The rape victim knew the class was recorded and posted.
She shared that knowing that, in a class full of people.
How did she not out herself?
I'm so confused - so she willingly tells the class she was raped but somehow he outed her?
And she was fine telling everyone in the class about it but somehow he did something wrong by posting the recording of the entire class/lecture inclusive of her story?
I'm not defending this guy - I'm saying the article was written in a way that's only making me ask more questions.
His employer asked him to edit the video.
His response was to use a victim of harassment as a tool to make a point.
I don't see how you can interpret this as anything but the Professor putting his own beliefs ahead of the well being of his students.
From what some other guy said, it seems  it was a setup all along.
Remove this "incident" and what's left?
Nothing!
No.
Attending a lecture you knew was going to be posted online and then talking about a story you dont want to be posted online is just plain idiotic.
If she didnt want it getting out there then she should not have brought it up in the lecture she knew was going to be posted online.
Better question.
How was her talking about it in front of the entire class not outing herself?
Coarsely speaking, both are personal requests.
They're different in magnitude, but it's not the prof's obligation to satisfy them.
Those details are very sensitive, but once they were said out into the open, they're basically public.
The classroom is not a psychotherapist's office and has no expectation of privacy in these matters.
&gt;But did she before hand?
Yes, even students commonly record lectures.
Also, a lecture hall is a public venue.
If you out yourself in public, why would you have a reasonable expectation of privacy?
&gt; It is also why producers will get people to sign waivers for things like reality TV shows so that their footage is usable and they wont get sued.
No, they mainly have to do that because they'd be *making money* off of your recording.
That's a whole different scenario.
&gt; And she was fine telling everyone in the class about it but somehow he did something wrong by posting the recording of the entire class/lecture inclusive of her story?
I can absolutely see that.
It's one thing to admit something to friends, it's something else to admit something in a class, and it's entirely something else to have something you shared in a class be recorded and posted online for the world to see - forever.
Seems like in another incident he invited Global News into the classroom to record a story -- doesn't appear to be a reasonable expectation of privacy within that class...
The letter also mentioned that it is problematic that he was uploading it to a completely publicly accessible drop box, and when prompted to remove the recording refused and instead turned to social media to tell others to download copies.
Acadia has a private Moodle system.
ACORN.
Never have I had a professor upload their in-class lectures to something like a public Youtube account.
It has always been distributed via class restricted Moodle pages.
That's the nature of tenure -- it's like that for a reason.
&gt;Anything to try and be "right" eh?
Are you sure you're not describing Vice here?
Grown edgelords would also apply to them.
I suggest you consume some media that's not pre-digested pablum of your already accepted views.
It's not his obligation, however it is a reasonable request.
When your response to a reasonable request isn't to comply, but rather to say They are trying to stifle free speech!
Everyone copy the file!
Make sure the information is spread", then you lose the benefit of the doubt that your actions were well intended.
And none of that takes away from the fact that your argument is somewhere between a false equivalence and an appeal to ridicule.
No, that's actually the exact same question.
A damn shame.
It used to be pretty good.
"and what's left" is a very long list, particularly when you consider it didn't even all fit in his dismissal letter.
The university's letter is much longer and more varied than just those two tings.
The total list of items didn't even all fit in the letter.
You mean the nature of tenure is that it is broadly defined?
noooo, i mean the nature of tenure is that you can only be fired for not carrying out specific duties -- not sure I would use the word basic though.
You can’t be fired for behavioural issues?
So you think she is lying?
nope.
There are some misunderstandings about free speech here.
Protecting free speech means the *government* should not interfere with your right to speak your opinion.
Professionals can be (and regularly are) held to the standards of their associations.
Just so you are aware he didn't post it online, it's in the Dropbox for his students.
I am much more concerned with false stories of rape being used by this student who has been trying to get him fired for awhile.
Fuck her and good for him for not allowing her to exploit rape victims for her personal agenda.
She is likely reading this, so a special personalized fuck you is in order.
so when he was asked to remove it and then he said all his supporters should make copies what was the narrative there.
She is part of a group of extreme SJW students and faculty at Acadia who have been trying to get him fired since he first stated that the truth requires all positions to be heard and critiqued the Truth and Reconciliation Report for contorting figures and narratives to present a flawed historical view.
He is actually a progressive left wing intellectual himself but was instantly labeled an Alt-Right White Supremacist Nazi for daring to say that.
it aint easy.
Vice News is alright.
It follows the old formula that Vice started with.
It's the other brands they have that are a bit iffy.
Kind of turning into an edgier Huffington Post.

Looks to me like if anybody got played, it was the professor.
Tenured profs have academic freedom (above and beyond their charter right) under which posting their lectures online would fall.
Putting *all* other factors aside, completely putting aside the fact that she told her story in public and he always posted the lectures, the fact that he refused to edit the lecture after it was requested and the fact that he actually asked students to save it and hold on to it points to malice.
Those are not the actions of an empathetic or even professional individual.
&gt; He found out she was not happy about it being posted online, and instead of publishing an edited version of the lecture, he directed others to save copies of the file containing her story.
What possible motivation would he have to do that if he were not acting maliciously?
Retaining whatever value she added to the lecture.
It's important to make a distinction between his lecture and his student's rape story.
Doubling down was purely to make a point at the expense of the student.
I guess the courts will decide whether or not he was within his rights.
He also defended the residential school program.
You have to be pretty tonedeaf to support *that.
*
Being able to argue in favor of unpopular things (like residential schools) is precisely what tenure is meant to protect.
A class is not a private event.
Whatever you say there is public.
You should go read the ([now public](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/rick-mehta-acadia-university-1.4819220)) letter from the university to the prof.
It was very detailed in exactly how and why this was happening.
The rape story recording is one of the most salient details, so it’s understandably one of the main things being recounted, but this was not a one-off instance that lead to him being canned.
He was fired for a myriad of reasons above and beyond the recording.
The letter describing them all literally said it couldn’t fit all the reasons in one (I think 17-page long?)
letter, so it just highlighted parts and referred to two appendices.
Dude he posted every lecture.
She asked him to remove it.
He instead pushed to distribute it even more.
He's a dick, and so is anyone who thinks it's ok.
He's being paid too much to talk already.
He can take the time to respect the people that pay his salary or stop expecting to receive it.
So you take what a random person online says at face value (with no source presented) rather than review the source material and make up your own mind?
[deleted]
&gt; Read the actual letter and not the vice article.
Indeed, [read the letter](http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/4858757/Letter-to-Dr-Rick-Mehta.pdf) that gives seven different sections of complaints, including *one* reference to the posted rape story.
This in itself would be reprehensible, and worthy of informal intervention, which is exactly what the University did.
The full letter outlines *copious* examples of other inappropriate behaviour from a professor, to wit (here just taking highlights *from the highlights*):


&gt; *In the discussion below I provide only examples to demonstrate the justification.
The complete set of documentation submitted with this letter provides the details and particulars supporting the allegations.
*

&gt;  *The grounds for disciplinary action are:*

 (1) **Unprofessional and non-collegial conduct directed at students, faculty and administration, including the creation of a poisoned work environment;**

* posting inappropriate material on your office door that is offensive

* making poisonous twitter statements that Acadia should start saving money by cutting the Women &amp; Gender Studies Program

* you attacked both the [university student newspaper] article and (author's name redacted) in many different foras

* the incident projecting the grades of psychology majors and minors in class and telling students that psychology majors were doomed for the future

* you referred to your students as engaging in cult like behavior and referencing Jonestown

* [your] unprofessional, disrespectful conduct you demonstrated at the Honours thesis defences on (redacted) including rolling your eyes, laughing and shaking your head during (redacted)'s thesis presentation about the impact of science and math engagement on girls' self-efficacy

* your conduct of acquiring the mail of (faculty name redacted) ... is non-collegial and inappropriate

* your use of social media, including posting a [confidential] letter ... where you are critical of two colleagues and included student survey data



(2) **Breaches of privacy in relation to students and colleagues;**

* your decision to invite Global News into your classroom with no regard for students' privacy

* your online [Twitter] postings where you provided identifying detail of the student (redacted)

* the public Dropbox posting of a recording of your (redacted) class in which student (redacted) disclosed her rape experience is reprehensible ... yet you refused to acknowledge the problem or remove the posting

* you responded by tweeting publicly to your followers to make copies to preserve the audio recordings online

* your posting of [confidential] student survey data of other instructors


(3) **Creation of a poisoned, intolerant teaching environment, particularly regarding sensitive issues of gender and race;**

* you make rude, intolerant and degrading comments and present yourself in a hostile demeanor to students

* you talked about rape culture in Intro to Psych and denied that sexual assault survivors are victims

* you stated that women are assaulted because they put themselves in dangerous environments

* you spoke unkindly of Indigenous persons, commented on how female students should try to prevent being raped and ... you put a student's name in the Powerpoint presentation in class and criticized the student openly to a large class of peers

* you have consorted with members of hate groups and movements including MRAs and the Alt-Right ... refusing to outright condemn their hate speech


(4) **Making inappropriate and potentially discriminatory comments towards women and vulnerable groups in the course of his professional duties and on social media;**

* the fact that there are sixteen different items in the category of potentially discriminatory or harassing posts is in itself alarming

* your public statements that gratuitously criticize the work of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission without valid explanation, academic support or relevance to your curriculum

* you are insensitively targeting Aboriginal people and transgender people online


(5) **Personal harassment and bullying of students, faculty and other members of the university community;**

* virtually every [interviewed] faculty and staff member identified situations of harassment and discrimination of women, transgendered individuals, black students, victims of violence, and Indigenous people

* your comments denigrated women, such as suggestions that they are not good at math, they are irrational

* you have also publicly demeaned a student for the quality of their research, then breached their privacy and posted comments inviting others to weigh in

* you have targeted department members in other forms of public communications such as talks ... these include your public attacks on WISE


(6) **Significant deviations from academic syllabus and significant use of irrelevant non-academic sources in class, resulting in a failure to teach the required course material;**

* there has been a detailed analysis conducted ... [and] you presented a large amount of material that would not normally be in an introductory Psychology course

* a significant amount of class time (in some classes 90% or more) was spent on topics which are irrelevant, or not connected to the course syllabus

* you are quick to shut down people who disagree with your perspective and that you often ignore students who you do not wish to hear or respond to


(7) **Unwilling to recognize harmful effects of actions on students and faculty.
**

* you have been completely unwilling to recognize the harmful impact that your actions are having on students, faculty and the University

* you have defiantly refused to adjust any of your conduct and "doubled down" on this activity by seeking support from free speech advocates outside of the University community

* your decontextualized social media postings, engagement of free speech supporters, and your gratuitous criticism of the University are all cause for serious concern

* you have not accepted responsibility for your actions or taken any steps to correct your behavior.
&gt; 1) She outed herself.
She has no right to privacy in this situation.
She told her story in a public place.
Not a public place: a pay-to-attend classroom.
The University is *well* within its rights to demand that a professor place a higher standard on students' privacy.
Ignoring the student's request to take down (or edit) the recording also shows a complete disregard for the position of power and trust the professor is placed in.
&gt; An activist student, who had been gunning for him to be fired for his position on First Nations, for no reason relevant to the discussion spoke in front of a room full of people

Source?
&gt; it infuriates the fuck out of me to see these low life pieces of shit exploiting the very serious issue of rape

You know what, no matter what you've been through, I don't think any of us get to decide what someone else gets to share and what they get to keep private.
If they feel raped, whether or not that meets your own definition of the word, I think we need to agree that they feel *aggrieved* and should be given some goddamn human consideration, especially from someone in a position of power like a tenured professor.
&gt; she was fine telling everyone in the class about it but somehow he did something wrong by posting the recording of the entire class/lecture inclusive of her story?
You mean there's no difference between sharing something with a group of people in a closed room and that info being shared with the entire world?
\crickets.
 &gt; As someone who was actually brutally beaten unconscious and raped in my youth it infuriates the fuck out of me to see these low life pieces of shit exploiting the very serious issue of rape for the sole reason of getting someone fired, fuck her she's a piece of shit.
What a convenient claim for a one month old account with numerous posts about how rape accusations are false.
&gt; Yes, even students commonly record lectures.
This is not at all related to the claim about *knowing* the professor was doing so.
You're moving the goalposts, which proves you have no real argument.
&gt; She purposely shared it publicly because she knew it was going to be uploaded as had every single other class of his she had ever attended.
And you know this... how?
&gt; false stories of rape

So you claim she wasn't raped?
&gt; Source?
their delusional minds.
So that whole list is reprehensible, but speaking as a teacher this point stood out to me:
&gt;you put a student's name in the Powerpoint presentation in class and criticized the student openly to a large class of peers

That's juvenile behaviour and unbecoming of an educator.
You don't get to wield your power as the teacher in a classroom or lecturer in a hall to single-out students in premeditated takedowns.
That's both demeaning to the individual and to the profession, what an asshole.
Speaking as a human:
&gt;your comments denigrated women, such as suggestions that they are not good at math, they are irrational

Get the fuck out of here.
Dropbox not youtube... only the class has access.
&gt; denied that sexual assault survivors are victims

What the fuck.
Concern trolling.
Everything has a label you can use to belittle and ignore somebody else's point of view.
He was fired because he was an asshole, who harassed and intimidated the people around him.
He did it while hiding behind "free speech" and "scientific discourse", but if you are at the point where other faculty members install panic buttons, you're just an asshole.
And you have absolutely zero real evidence she did this intentionally.
None.
You just made that up because it fits your narrative.
[deleted]
i know that Stalin apparently killed people, but which individual people specifically?
"millions" isn't specific so he's probably totally innocent.
Of course they claim accusations are false, since they've been making false claims themself.
He stated not every student that attended Residential Schools was abused and there seems to be a perception that every student was.
This is then contorted and twisted into him denying sexual assault survivors are victims.
The venue is a public space that she knows is recorded, there was no expectation of privacy.
[removed]
I said yes to the fact that she knew beforehand that the prof recorded all his lectures, which proves that you have trouble reading.
You should look into that.
[removed]

&gt;You mean there's no difference between sharing something with a group of people in a closed room and that info being shared with the entire world?
No, I'm saying this:

&gt;I'm not defending this guy - I'm saying the article was written in a way that's only making me ask more questions.
I'm very much on your side, but this article sucks anyway.
Lots of people in this thread have been defending him because the article makes unfair and misleading points, and is written with obvious spin.
The CBC's reporting was a lot better.

Summary: 
Recording and uploading all of your classes?
He records and uploads all his classes.
I am fine with all of this.
He was posting all his lectures online.
The rape victim knew the class was recorded and posted.
I can absolutely see that.
Sure, every professor should record themselves.
Do I have that right?
The defense is that these people knew the classes were recorded and uploaded.
I think that's a reasonable request.
It would have been that easy.
She asked him to remove it.
Yes, even students commonly record lectures.
Then the university fired him.
Dude he posted every lecture.
&gt; Yes, even students commonly record lectures.
He did it on purpose.
She shared that knowing that, in a class full of people.
I guess we will find out.
I don't see that as spinning the narrative.
If she didn't want it recorded and uploaded, why talk about it?
It's important to make a distinction between his lecture and his student's rape story.
He was fired for a myriad of reasons above and beyond the recording.
&gt;She knew that he recorded and released all of this lectures.
If this woman did not approve of the recording, then I have no sympathy for his firing.
They wrote that he posted "a recording of a class," not "a secret recording of her."
Read the letter from the university.
He didnt do his job, and refused to do it, so he was fired.
If you out yourself in public, why would you have a reasonable expectation of privacy?
He knew what the content of the lecture would be when he chose to post it online.
It's not hard at all.
2) I think the fact that he was posting all his classes online is an important detail.
It says it clearly there that he was uploading all his lectures.
He seems to be saying that it was unfair for him to be fired.
He didn't just secretly record the woman speaking and post it online.
If the professor does indeed record and upload all of their classes, that is very different than the information we're given here.
Thats not actually how Tenure works.
In that case the university can fire him.
Have you been to a university?
You make that choice for yourself.
I fundamentally disagree with that, and think that it would have been very easy for him to cut her story out of his recording.
If she didnt want it getting out there then she should not have brought it up in the lecture she knew was going to be posted online.
She has no right to privacy in this situation.
Just so you are aware he didn't post it online, it's in the Dropbox for his students.
They are not paid to sit in their office and edit class recordings.
If there's something you don't want recorded, don't talk about it.
&gt;  Vice is spinning the narrative

you don't say.
Because it is one thing if he was recording himself but it is another to record other people.
The actions can be interpreted in different ways.
She told her story in a public place.
That's the nature of tenure -- it's like that for a reason.
I don't agree with what the Prof did, but the article is trash.
I don't understand why you feel this point is so important.
A class is not a private event.
Dropbox not youtube... only the class has access.
The university's letter claims he was fired for "privacy breach" and "harassment."
I am much more concerned with false stories of rape being used by this student who has been trying to get him fired for awhile.
That is how the world works.
&gt; Read the actual letter and not the vice article.
&gt;...he publicly posted a recording of a class in which she detailed being raped in a publicly available Dropbox.
University students are adults, and the students knew beforehand everything was going to be recorded and uploaded.
If he records it, and someone lies to defame him, he can sue.
Whatever you say there is public.
The venue is a public space that she knows is recorded, there was no expectation of privacy.
