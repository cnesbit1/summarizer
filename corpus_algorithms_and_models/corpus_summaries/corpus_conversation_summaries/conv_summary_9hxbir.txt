Just about everything is up for trade other than my Rayquaza collection.
Also have some Poipole and LL codes for trade.
(i'll entertain any other event offers for these. )'
Able to do Japan Redemptions and RNG.
hii,

hoopa, ID: Alexander, OT:10036,self obtained with 'A' button WC proof

nature:modest, what is your rate for the poipole and ll codes?
also have bold, calm,naive natures.
Do you need the L/L codes redeemed/RNG'd?
Poipole i'd say 3ish would be fair no?
What rate were you thinking of?
ill redeem the codes myself , but as for the rate I was thinking a bit more , especially for the modest one, what kind of rate would you offer for a mix of these both codes?
Do you have more than one?
Modest/Adamant/Timid/Jolly/Quiet/Brave Any of these natures work for me.
I could do 3 and 3?
How many were you looking to get?
3 and 3 for one modest?
That works for me!
sorry for the delay was a bit busy, anyways can you make it 4 LL, 3 poipole.
I don't have that many LL codes.
I just gave the 4 I had to a different trade.
I can for sure get 3ish tomorrow or possibly more.
Right now i'm down to 4 Poipole codes.
Can you do 4 Poipole and 3 L/L?

15ish hours from now.
