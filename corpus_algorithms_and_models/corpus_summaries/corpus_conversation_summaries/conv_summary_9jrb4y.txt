What's the scariest horror movie you've ever watched?
When I was young, The Maid(singaporean horror movie)
Definitely ju-on.

OG Shutter.
I felt Conjuring was not too bad; the *clap clap* cupboard scene made me jump.

The Ring back when I was in primary school

Conjuring 2 is probably subjectively scarier, but I'm so desensitized to horror already that it was just a good ride when I watched it.
coming soon.
probably because i was still young back then.
Heredity.
That was my first horror movie as well!
watched it during a chalet in sec sch.
Images of the ghost lingered in my head for monthsüòÇ.
Hereditay.
Just dyed my hair pink and cut bangs and now the consensus is that i look like an anime character :‚Äù)

Nah, girls with pink/silver hair are hot.
