Original Response: 
 Free Will is an important part of many religions.
Here's a simple argument against it that doesn't involve any science.
**P1) You can only deliberately do what you most want to do, and only freely choose what you most want to choose (in any given situation).
**  


**P2) You cannot control what you want.
**  


**Conclusion: You cannot control what you deliberately do or what you freely choose.
In other words: You don't have free will.
**  


**In defense of P1:**  
A common objection is: *Of course I can do stuff I don't want to do!
I can go to work.
I can clean the toilet.
I can overcome my instincts and rudimentary desires, like forcing myself not to eat delicious but unhealthy food all the time.
I can hold back violent impulses.
I can decide not to lie although doing it would sometimes make my life way easier.
* 

That's certainly possible, but you only do all of those things because of another, stronger desire that requires you *to* do it, like earning money, having a clean toilet, living healthy, not getting in trouble with the law, obeying the rules of your religion etc.
...
There's a constant battle of conflicting wants and desires going on in your head, most of them unconscious, and whenever you decide to do anything it's only because one of them trumps all the others.
But you can't control which one.
Why is your desire to earn money stronger than your desire to stay at home and watch Netflix?
Why is your desire to live healthy stronger than your desire to taste delicious food?
Why is your desire to obey the rules of your religion stronger than your desire to have an easy life?
It just is.
And for other people it may just be different.
Here's another way of looking at it: Whenever you purposely do *anything* I can always ask "Why?"
a few times until all you can say is "I just want it.
*"* Let me give a few examples.
1) Why do you go to work?
*Because I want to earn money.
* Why?
*Because I want to be able to pay rent and buy food.
* Why?
*Because I want to have a comfortable life.
* Why?
*I just want it.
* 

2) Why did you almost sacrifice your life to save an innocent child?
*Because I'd rather die then live with the knowledge that I could have rescued the child but didn't.
* Why?
*Because I would have felt guilty for the rest of my life and I don't want that.
* Why?
*Because it's a really bad feeling that I want to avoid.
* Why?
*That's just how it is.
* 

3) Why did you **not** choose to do whatever hypothetical thing that you really want to do and that doesn't have any negative consequences at all?
*Because I wanted to prove to you that I have free will and can overcome my desires.
* Why?
*Because I want to refute your argument.
* Why?
*Because free will is an important part of my religious belief and I want to be convinced that it's real.
* Why?
*Because I don't want there to be any contradictions in what I believe.
* Why?
*Because that would be an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance that I don't want to experience.
* Why?
*Because I want to feel good and a peace.
* Why?
*I just want it.
*  


Notice how incredibly easy it would be to disprove **P1**: Give me *one* example of anything you could deliberately do without wanting to, and everything falls apart.
**In defense of P2:** 

Think of something you want.
Try not to want it.
Think of something you don't want.
Try to want it.
I definitely can't do it.
Yet some people claim they can.
But that's impossible to achieve because based on **P1** it inevitably leads to an infinite regress: If you *decide to* control or change your desires it's *only because you want to* do so.
Now there are two possibilities: Either you *just happen to want* to change your desires, in which case that's simply another one of your uncontrollable wants.
Or you somehow *decide to want* to change your desires.
But you can only *decide to* do it if you *want to* do it, so you're back where you started.
Either you just happen to want to want to change your desires, or you choose to do so, which you can only do if you want to, and so on.
Even if you think your desires are somehow determined by your soul: You still didn't choose to have them, can't do anything about them and always act according to them.
&amp;#x200B;

Alright, maybe now you say: "My desires are still a part of me as an agent, I'm still the person acting them out, so I'm still responsible for what I do."
- but that's missing the point.
What matters is your conscious self being in charge of your actions; and all your conscious self can do is witness (although most of the time it also has the illusion of being in control).
It's like you're the captain of a ship and your hands are tied to the ship's wheel, but you can't turn the wheel, the wheel is being turned by the movements of the ship which is being propelled by it's engine while getting pushed around by the wind and the waves.
But you're so focused on what the ship does that you don't notice that - you're not looking at your hands, you're only feeling them holding the steering wheel and always following its rotation.
It feels like you're the one in control, like you're the one steering, but really you aren't.
To summarize: You can do whatever you want, but you can't decide *what* you want.
You are a slave of your wants.
All you can do is experience them and experience the actions you take because of them.
Even your noblest intentions can be traced back to very basic desires over which you have absolutely no control.
Cheers.
(Just to give some credit, this argument is based on a YouTube video by CosmicSkeptic called "Why Free Will Doesn't Exist")

Summary: 
Try not to want it.
You are a slave of your wants.
a few times until all you can say is "I just want it.
I definitely can't do it.
*Because I want to earn money.
*Because I want to have a comfortable life.
I can go to work.
*Because I want to refute your argument.
*That's just how it is.
I can clean the toilet.
Think of something you don't want.
