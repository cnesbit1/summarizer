Does anyone else find it weird that TSN is basically exploiting the tragedy for ratings/clicks?
Its commercial free.
They aren't making money off of this.
The families asked them to do it.
No.
If that's what this was about, they'd be running commercials.
There's a very real chance TSN is making a loss on this.
what?
are you insane?
Does anyone else find it weird that no matter what someone does to help people in need, there will ALWAYS be someone who bitches about it?
No commercials and not geoblocked like every other video on their site.
They are not in it for the money tonight.
Dude, no ads on the broadcast.
Theyre eating the costs of broadcasting and what it took to get the people out there and i highly doubt theyre making up for the full revenue by any ads on their website... this is actually pretty classy of them.
I cant speak much of TSN otherwise, as I'm American, but this seems like it was done for the right reasons from my viewpoint.
Free global stream and no commercials, also Duthie said that the families wanted to do this.
Also they had Ron and Don on a TSN broadcast.
Please suspend your cynicism for one night and feel something else, there are a lot of other emotions available tonight and we can leave that one for another time.
If you love hockey, we’re family tonight.
We always are, but a little closer.
And it has nothing to do with TSN or any other media corporation.
Just family tonight, okay brother?
Going for a downvotes WR?
Freight for all of the equipment and that broadcast table, travel cost and payroll for the broadcasters, cameramen, sound guys, and other behind the scenes people, then the costs of the broadcast itself, they are almost guaranteed to be losing money on this.
Now that you say that about Ron and Don.
I listened to them and didn't even realize it was TSN.
That's kind of amazing, well TSN is also amazing.
Ya it just kinda happened and I accepted it and thought hey that’s cool.
Then you said it and I was like oh shit that’s right.

Summary: 
They are not in it for the money tonight.
Also they had Ron and Don on a TSN broadcast.
Dude, no ads on the broadcast.
They aren't making money off of this.
