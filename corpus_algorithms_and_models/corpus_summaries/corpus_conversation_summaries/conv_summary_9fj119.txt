He also just recently requested ownership of ecr_plus, which I found odd.
link?

That is pretty odd, considering we created ecr_plus in a similar situation to what we had here.
But they can have it as far as I'm concerned.
bad bot.
makes much more sense now, ty kind helper bot.
Someone deleted your first reply to me.

I deleted it by mistake on my phone, sorry.
Ill add it back.
Oh gotcha, just making sure.
He probably scripted himself invisible, rendering his username immune.
thx.
on mobile so yes im being lazy.
Now you start making a point for harassment...
Pardon?
I just got banned from vapistan sub.
Probably because I did a waving emoji to sycho on a post of his saying goodbye.
A little petty of me I suppose but I didn't ever do anything in that sub anyway.
There's a pretty large difference between harassment and voicing your opinion on the internet.
The problem is most people don't know the difference these days.
Having your feelings hurt because someone disagrees is not the same thing as harassment.
how petty.
Yeah I'm a huge asshole I guess.
I believe he has his own vaping sub if you still need closure.
Nah I'm good.
I wouldn't want to make anyone feel sad.

thank you for making my point.
And my question is why then do you stalk and harass him?
I'm not doing that but think what you want.
That seems to be best.
[Whatever, right?

It was a valid question.
I wonder how you would feel if you were threatened with a ban for posting on an alt.
Is this someone's alt?
no he's just a shitposter and im okay with that.
Yeah that doesn't really bother me.
If you're gonna talk .
At least ping /u/Corvusfan23.
He may not have come out of this smelling like a rose, but it's all a learning experience.
He didn't blatantly violate rules.
I mean /r/Vapistan is his home sub.
I believe you engaged in brigading just then, and now by mentioning it.
Meh, I don't care enough.
Was just sharing a thought.
I personally don't think I engaged in brigading but if a rational thinking mod believes I did, I'm sure they'll take necessary action.
I'm not reporting it.
Nor do I think mod action is necessary.
Just time to simmer down.
I can agree with you there.
I don't love drama and I've participated in it with comments this week a bit more than I needed to.
He hasn’t to my knowledge either.
He’s just not popular at the moment but he has been civil through this from what I’ve seen.
We all have on this.
I’ve tried my best to stay out and not participate yet here I am too right lol.
We can at least all try and be polite and respectful to one another through this right :)

Exactly.
I thought Corvus got a little overheated at the start of all this, but no big deal, everyone gets mad sometimes.
It's not like a methodical, planned, rule breaking adventure.
Agreed.
Hopefully we can all be a bit more levelheaded through this, myself included lol.
No doubt.
He removed a petition about him stepping down as "harassment".
u/Corvusfan23

If modding is such a sensitive issue for you then maybe you shouldn't mod.
Dammit High I just choked on my water.
And voted to give /r/ecigarette to sychophantom.
So then you're also stalking him by reading *his* post history.
Damn.
Is there like, any way of showing this to anyone?
I mean while we are on the roll of removal we may as well hit as many douchenozzles as possible.
\#ChuckTitsToo.
Same.
He is a blatantly tactless, baiting dickbag.

Summary: 
I can agree with you there.
I'm not doing that but think what you want.
