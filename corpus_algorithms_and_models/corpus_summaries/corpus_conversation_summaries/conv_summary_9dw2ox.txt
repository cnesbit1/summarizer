Original Response: 
The Sandy Hoax is the central issue being used by the jewish/communist-run Leftist Establishment to censor Alex Jones, and then mass censor alternative media and anti-NWO activists on the internet.
So it is important to address this, and know the truth.
Here is video of Alex Jones from January of 2014 where he says:

"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors...manufactured.
I couldn't believe it at first."

Excellent documentary exposing Sandy Hook as a hoax:

"Unravelling Sandy Hook"

One of my interns personally knew one of the adults who died there.
Hard for me to believe otherwise; she was an honest person.
I know what you mean.
I have a unlcle whose ex wife actually taught piano to several of the students.
It's disgusting what people say about the victims.
My cousin’s dentist’s former employer lives there and said the whole thing was fake, so....
No adults died there so at some point leading up to your comment a mistake was made or a lie was told.
I don't know how you could get so misinformed.
There were 6 adults and 20 children killed.
If you aren't willing to do basic research before calling someone a liar, you have a problem.
And that type of ignorance doesn't belong in a sub like this.

Lmao, no shit the official narrative is a thing.
No one died and no one was shot.
You know what doesn’t belong in a sub like this?
Users who don’t contribute conspiracy material and who think Sandy Hook was a real shooting.
You really are allergic to evidence and facts aren't you joe?

Lol what a spastic.
For many here including me Sandy Hook was the first conspiracy theory they ever got into.
Because it’s so obvious that it’s top to bottom, front to back, 100% a goofy **hoax** which has been proven a hundred different ways now.
What a joke you are, asking me for proof when there’s 6 years of proof piled up for anyone to readily see already — despite the desperate censorship on YouTube, Facebook, and elsewhere.
I can and would gladly embarrass you anytime about Sandy Hook if you had the balls to debate about it.
It’s funny how much you love “space” and NASA and the official narrative of government-staged shooting hoaxes, yet you never seem to find time to post about them, in a positive light, or discuss with like-minded official narrative imbibers, but instead spend your time appearing wherever these entities and constructs are called into question to comically attempt to quell the skepticism or critique.
Obviously this entails much time spent following me around.
As always you are welcome to make a post about why you love NASA or why Sandy Hook is a real shooting.
Or even challenge me to a debate.
Or win the $10,000 Baller Challenge.
But, you seem to prefer parasitism.
And yet I've never seen a single drop of evidence that held any weight, and you haven't presented us with any.
You're full of it.

It's funny how you never actually address anything I say and how you never actually do any experiments to disprove your idea that the Earth is flat.
You just base it all of feelings.
*Or even challenge me to a debate*

Really?
Fine what are the ground rules and loss conditions?
[removed]
No, but I can say it's fake because of the mountains of evidence I've researched for the past 3 years, and I can easily and thoroughly embarrass you if you debate me about it.
lol then do it.
You keep on saying how you could thoroughly destroy some one in a debate like a fake-ass Ben Shapiro without walking the walk.
Removed rule 10.
People with facts.
You're saying people with facts don't belong here.
