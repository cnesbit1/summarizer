My personal fav anymore from this shoot?
the preview pic looks like a waterfall is coming out of her hooha.
I have seen her a few times in real life with no makeup on and she is not that great looking.
hhnnnggg.....
That's very Farrah.
It might be lupus...
The quality isn't fantastic but it is from the site that the shoot comes from[rest of shoot] (http://www.mensfitness.com/women/galleries/jennifer-morrison)edit: link.
Its never lupus.
Not fantastic quality?
That's sure putting it kindly... that's *terrible* quality!
I tried to find some better ones but I couldn't find a higher definition version of all of them.
I wasn't trying to blame you...
I just can't believe a magazine that large would put images like that on their website.
A few more from the [shoot here](http://www.gotceleb.com/jennifer-morrison-mens-health-magazine-june-2009-2010-02-17.html?pid=36345) in better quality.
I totally understand.
Yeah it seems a bit strange to me that they don't have higher quality pictures since they were the ones who took them.
