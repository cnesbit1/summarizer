I would be uncomfortable with it too.
Porn is one thing but to me using a cam girl's services is interacting one on one with another person in a sexual context outside of the relationship.
I don't know if I'd consider it cheating but I get why you feel that way.
I think you should communicate this to him the way you did in your post.
I can understand if others don't find it cheating.
I wouldn't hold it against him either right now since we never talked about cam girls before.
He has had no way to know that its not something I'm okay with.
When I talk to him I'll stay away from using the word 'cheating' so he doesn't feel like I'm accusing him of that, because I really don't want him to feel that way.

Okay.
I'll stay away from demanding language.
Thank you.
Jesus.
No.
Look, people get what they think they deserve and/or are willing to put up.
If you're willing to date men who watch cam girls, then that's what you'll get.
The goal isn't to convince him, the goal is to be dating someone with the same attitude and standards towards sexuality as you have.
It'd be cool if your attitude was cam girls were a-okay.
But it isn't.
&amp;#x200B;

You should be able to clearly state you consider cam girls cheating, you know you guys didn't speak about it so you recognize, objectively, it isn't cheating in your relationship, but for you it's a form of cheating and you want him to stop.
&amp;#x200B;

It's okay to ask your SO to stop doing something that hurts you.
It really is.
And it's okay to stop dating them if your standards of okay sexual behavior with others don't match.
I wouldn't encourage a monogamous person to date someone who was poly, even if they could "get over it".
And I wouldn't encourage you to date someone who doesn't automatically see why cam girls are not okay once you point out why to you it feels like cheating.
Your concerns are totally valid.
I wouldn't want my partner engaging in interactive  sessions either.
Has he told you his level of interaction with them?
Watching cam girls can range from the (very expensive) Skype like private chats where you can both see each other to simply watching their pre-recorded videos.
It could be that his level  interaction doesn't cross your boundaries (fingers crossed).
However if his use crosses the line knowing the specifics of what's available will aid you in coming up with clear boundaries and will help avoid this type of misunderstanding in the future.
You may want to look into how much this is all costing him as well.
It would be easy to spend hundreds a month on that sort of habit (assuming a lot of interaction).

She can be demanding, but she doesn't have to be accusative.
In other words, saying: "I consider cam girls cheating, so I want you to stop watching" is okay, but saying "you cheated on me because you watched cam girls" is a bad idea.

However you plan on approaching the subject, this is 100% priority to communicate to him within the first few minutes of the conversation.
If he feels accused he might start to close up, though you know him better than me so take that how you will.

Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and make sure that your boundaries are stated clearly and directly.
He needs to understand what is okay and what isn’t okay in your relationship.
Just know that he may say he agrees, or that he’ll stop, and he might not end up doing so.
A lot of times when that’s what a guy is into he ends up going back to it anyway.
I was going to write something else, but your comment is apt to the circumstances and couldn't have said it better.
Its not said specifically, but about setting and mainlining boundarys and expectations 

edit: words.
I agree, I was going to say just show him this post, it’s worded perfectly.
"BF, when you watch cam girls it makes me feel insecure in our relationship and it makes me feel like we are not exclusive.
I need to know that we are exclusively sexual with each other, and not other people."
Gauge how he reacts.
If he reacts poorly, he will react poorly anytime you express a need you have.

&gt; "you cheated on me because you watched cam girls"

Totes.
The reality is that if you don't explicitly define the rules of your relationship or at least the general boundaries you can't accuse cheating.
100% with you.
Using the word "cheating" to describe her position on the matter and explicitly asking to stop  was my primary point.
This:

&gt; When you sit him down, don't tell him to quit.
I do not agree with.
&gt; Is it ok for someone to ask their SO to stop hanging out with platonic friends because they make them uncomfortable?
Yes.
Now, should they do it?
Well depends on the circumstances.
Maybe.
&gt; Even if it's a boundary, it's controlling.
Look, every relationship to one degree or another is "controlling".
Perhaps our culture says "here's the line of TOO controlling" and another culture has a different line for too controlling.
As long as everyone is being clear on their expectations and people are free to opt in and out as they will, I call it good.
&gt; OP should tell her partner she considers cam girls cheating and that she won't be in a relationship with someone who does that.
The ball is then in his court.
Agreed.
