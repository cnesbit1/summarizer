You know she's been in other movies too...
Yes.
[Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Elizabeth_Winstead)Picture is of her as Ramona Flowers.
I am the only person in my office who chose her when asked who my dream celebrity would be.

I think it's mostly just her as a punk chick that I find rather attractive.
Her in her usual attire doesn't capture my attention anywhere near as much.Maybe I just have a thing for punk chicks in general.
&gt;.&gt;
As much as I love Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the movie doesn't really do any justice to her good looks.
Unbelievably hot in real life.
