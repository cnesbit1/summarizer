Does the new addition have a name yet.

Call it knackers.

How about Roswell?
In Old English it means horse spring (maybe not the season exactly but it's still quite a good coincidental name).
I like it, her mums name is plum so we were toying with the idea of Santa Rosa (a type of plum).
But Crankshaft and pimple are both up there.
Knackers is decent too.

Call it Reddit.
Why not your username?
*Batsmoke* sounds like a fantastic name for a horse!
If you want something girly, Primavera is Italian for Spring.
You could pop that in somewhere in her registry name.
I think it's really pretty.
Or is it "Knockers" for a filly?
Crankshaft ftw.
If an Aussie named their horse Zenith or Aurora their mates would give them shit until the end of their days.
Surely she's going to be called Bonnie.
Bonnie the Clyde.
No.
Knackers is a good name for a horse, because they all end up being sent to the knackery in the end.
If I was ridiculously wealthy, I would have a racehorse named dogfoodifitdoesn'twin.

That must be an inside joke coz I don't get it.
Go with Perkins.
The name knackers is usually given to rams and bulls and not horses due to their retention.
Relevant username.
Or FutureSuperGlue...
What is wrong with Crankshaft.
Nothing!
I love the name!
Maybe I’m stupid but I thought ftw meant “for the win”.
