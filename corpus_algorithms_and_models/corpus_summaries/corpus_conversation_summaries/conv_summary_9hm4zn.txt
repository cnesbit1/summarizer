Took nearly 700 miles but I finally made it the entire day without forgetting to cancel my indicators.
I dont think I will ever feel this good again.
I’m all about accidentally hitting the horn when I’m reaching (my thumb) over to switch off the indicator.
Can't hit the horn if it doesn't work *head tap*
ride a BMW and know the true frustration of stupid indicator/horn layout.
Story of my life.
Then people look at you like "wtf is this knob beeping about"
I swear that Honda has 2 different Horn/Indicator layouts that change randomly when I get on my motorcycle.
My horn works, but:

Can't hit the horn while trying to cancel the indicators if you don't have indicators.
I know that feeling.
Every few weeks it'll work for one tiny beep, then back to silence.
I'm about to get rid of it, looks terrible anyways lol.
Grom has the indicators and horn swapped around, went to bip at someone after they nearly skittled me and Icancelled my indicators the hardest they'd ever been cancelled.
Glad to know it's not just me.
It certainly doesn't help that the horn and turn signal button positions are swapped between my last and current bike that I've only had a little over a month now.
I've started just pretending to wave at someone when I do it now and there are cars around...
I was trying to park in a spot by a crowd of people and missed the indicator.
Just laid on the horn for a few seconds because I was so surprised and didn't realize the horn was mine for a bit.
I didn't want to take off my helmet after that :/
Oh fuck yes!
I did my first ride yesterday and did that a few times.
