Hi, I am looking for a 4 nature Fuura City Lugia redeem (Bold, Timid, Modest, Calm).
If possible, I would prefer a stock redemption with A button and WC proof!
I would be providing the code.
In return I can offer RNG TSV shines (Pcalc, CFW 3DS, checkpoint managed save, would be self bred) or a small amount of NA codes.
I have 2 T/T and 2 K/G.
I would also prefer premier ball flair or higher.
Thanks for looking!
I can redeem this for you :) don’t need anything in return.
Just let me know the language and date.
Oh, thank you!
I would like JPN tag, and any date within the code's lifespan.
Is it okay to send it now?
Yep yep!
I actually just got the one I needed for someone else so I can work on yours.
Code sent!
If it is not too much trouble, could you put both of our usernames in the proof?
[This](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1csTuQllsmLP3Ix9RicafyQIaOGkgXdvy) is my standard proofing :) I’ll put your name in the “for” box.
Okay!
Are you sure you wouldn't like anything in return?
Nah.
These guys are fairly easy.
Although your nature is being stubborn lol.
Sorry about that, I was hoping that 4 natures would be more convenient, but RNG will be RNG sometimes &gt;_&lt;
Haha.
That it will!
My daughter finally fell back asleep so I’m going to grab a quick nap - will finish claiming in about an hour or so when I wake up :)
I lied.
She’s awake &gt;.&lt; I got your modest Lugia ready though!
*edit* it’s on my JPN DS - FC 3841-0700-9852.
Oh, does this mean you can trade now?
If so that is good timing since I just finished up giving someone their GA eggs.
Speaking of which, if you would like to claim anything [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cdAs8RgSrTSgaKrkaeH4Uph7kjbWlZSADpFVYlqj-MA/edit?usp=sharing) feel free to do so ^ _ ^  Perhaps they can be prizes in your ongoing GA or added to your personal collection!
Yep yep!
I can trade now :) I'll go check out the giveaway in a little bit!
I have a bunch of new saves on my CFW DS that I just got so maybe I'll have some kind of incentive to play those up....haha.
I edited my previous comment with the correct FC if you can make sure to add that.
The IGN in this game is め.
Okay, I've added you and am heading online!
Enjoy your Lugia :) Also - can you link me where to post to claim the eggs?
I actually have a couple of matches :)
Thank you for the redeem!
It is much appreciated!
The GA itself is closed, but here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/comments/9jsk0r/flash_giveaway_get_your_eggs/)

Even though the GA is closed feel free to make a comment if you'd like ^ _ ^

Edit: All of the tabs on the spreadsheet I linked are for the GA :)
Ok!
Thank you very much :) I’ll go comment there then since there’s a few that match that I need for my shining living dex project ~~that I might eventually get to working on~~
I just realized the date on your proof is wrong.
The Lugia itself is perfect, but I forgot to change the proof date.
It was done on 9.30.18 (just in case you want to trade it and someone has issues with the proof)
No problem.
It actually ended up being the nature I wanted most, so it will be staying in my collection!
But thank you for letting me know!
Oh yay!
That works out then haha :)

Summary: 
I would be providing the code.
Thank you for the redeem!
I actually have a couple of matches :)
I just realized the date on your proof is wrong.
I can redeem this for you :) don’t need anything in return.
That works out then haha :)
