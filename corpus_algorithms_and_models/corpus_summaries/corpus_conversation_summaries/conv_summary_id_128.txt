Original Response: 
Does anyone know of what companies are hiring for the refinery construction jobs?
I'm heading down there this week to work for Cajun.
What's your trade?
Looking to start actually.
I have some rigging experience but I'm not certified.
I'm a rigger.
Been doing it 23 years.
You can get certified pretty easily.
Try TnT and see if they will hire you.
Thanks, I'm going to go to the CMEF open house here in Houston tomorrow.
They do nccer certifications for rigging.
KBR and Turner have a lot of work around here right now and ETS seems to have a decent chunk coming up.
Not sure who the heck will be doing all that construction for M&amp;G Chemicals, but sure to be some there.
If you wanna work in rigging I'd look at Zachry/JVIC... Bay, or TNT.
