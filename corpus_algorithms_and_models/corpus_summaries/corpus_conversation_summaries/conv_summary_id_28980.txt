Natalie, Sophie, Maisie, then Rose for me.
4, 2, 1, 3.And to be honest, just 4 and 2 with any conviction.
Could take or leave the other 2.
One is not like the other three.
Natalie looks majestic.
Just go right to left, but #4 stands above the rest.
MRW you were on your way to the fetal-alcohol syndrome convention but took a wrong turn and ended up at a fashion show with some hot models, and have to act like you’re one of the models so you don’t get in trouble.
How...
So...?
Brunette, two redheads, a blonde.
Mixed ages.
Two with lipstick and two without.
Varying heights.
Same show.
Different dresses... Who is odd woman out?
Maisie, Natalie, Sophie, Rose for me.
But big big dropoff between Natalie and Sophie, not just cuz I hate redheads.
I mentally used Blonde Sophie to see if she could near Natalie.
3, 4, 1, 2.
2,1,3,4 Probably not a popular choice but it’s my preference.
That's actually the way I'd go too.
1,3,4,2.
4, 1, 2, 3But I respect your choice.
We all have different..uh..."needs"
At least Rose is #1 that’s what’s important here.
Always.
Who doesn't have a thing for redheads?
The short hairy one on the far left, that poor girl has got 20ft pole marks all over her.

Summary: 
Natalie, Sophie, Maisie, then Rose for me.
Maisie, Natalie, Sophie, Rose for me.
