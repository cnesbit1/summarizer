Original Response: 
Good Evening,I am an avid cyclist in the area but sadly some unexpected bills came up and I’m selling both of my bikes.
One is a mountain bike and the other is a road bike.
Both bikes were bought at Bay Area Bicycles off airline and always maintained by the mechanic there.
Hit me up if interested.
I put a lot of upgrades in both.
What kind is the mountain?
Giant Talon 2016.
Any extras?
Or bare bones bike?
Like disk brakes, upgraded derailleurs, etcEdit: also what frame size?
It’s the whole bike.
I upgraded fork, wheels, tires,two bottle cages, pedals.
Tubeless ready.
Size is large.
Edit.
PM if interested can text picturesEdit2.
Upgraded front and rear hubs to Shimano XT hubs.
Are there any good mtb trails around here?
I'be been wanting to get a bike and start riding.
Unfortunately I think the giant will be out of my price range though.
Check out the Facebook group Corpus Christi Trail Devils.
The address to the trail head is 8522 Salsa Dr.
