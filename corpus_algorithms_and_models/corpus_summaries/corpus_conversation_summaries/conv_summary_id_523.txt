Hey everyone,Ive been in Corpus for a little over a year now and need of my work clothes tailored.
Ive gone to 'His and Hers' and the guy took almost a month to patch a jacket, which takes about 5 minutes.
Im trying to get shirts/slacks to get a modern fit/slim fit and most older tailors dont do well with this kind of work from my experience, so I think a younger tailor would be ideal.Thanks in advance!

My wife uses Yolanda's Alterations at Airline and Holly.
She hasn't had a complaint yet.
Awesome!
Thanks for the recommendation.

I second Yolanda's!
My wedding dress needed an alteration and she was marvelous and quick.
Prices were very reasonable too.
Go visit her sometime.
