Original Response: 
Both cause I play necro and I am lame I had big problems with both "dont get hit" and "do it in 8 minutes" achivs.
Thankfully guildy come to help -so here are some tips :

1, if second person get hit, you keep your achiv - so just get into cover and wait for second person to do it

2, you cant go on more then once place at once -game port you after sniper get into phase so you need always cross the field

3, 8 minutes is preatty easy with mesmers or thiefs, so if you have friedns with classes like that to help you -its great.
4, most people would know -but as in many other part of game -any port skill can port you up - in each part when you stand below the tower (so sniper cant hit you) you can port up and start dps and dont need to go around (as you cant spawn bunny in poison field)

5, btw even jackal with all those evades get insta hit, so dont try it.
You can easily solo both achievements at once, no need for multiple people.
I died multiple times from the face-to-face combat and still hat 2 minutes left on the clock.
Trick is to lure him down the hill before he reaches 35% aka wants to go into third phase.
Why?
Because he will walk all the way up the stairs again before porting to the last section.
Thus you can easily walk from tower 2 to tower 3 without him sniping you.

Don't care sorry.
You made that clear by coming back to leave another comment.
Nice one.
And again.
Best way to show that you don't care is to simply not respond.
Stay dense :)
Yes I care so much for your issues with misgendering in a videogame

Try to get this straight.
First of all, I am not the guy who corrected you, I don't really care if you go back and edit it or not, I just find it highly amusing how you find spending 10 seconds editing your comment is "too much work" whilst you are 100% okay to add new comments about how you don't care, if you think editing is a waste of time, replying is an even bigger waste of time and you are probably dumb enough to add yet another reply to this one even though I **blatantly** **tell** **you** **not** **to**.
The easiest way to show that you don't care at all would be to not reply at all in the first place, it wasnt curiousity that killed the cat in this case, it was stupidity.
Somebody didn't get his tendies today I see.
"I tell you not to comment" - who the hell do you think you are?
Actually writing stuff like that... Get a grip, kid.
And yes, you're not even the guy who made the comment.
Which makes it even more insane to go and on with your wHyDoYoURepLyIfUDoNtCaRE nonsense.
You know I was thinking about doing a "who's a good boy" joke, since your name is corgibutt, but you just went on and cared some more whilst saying you dont care.
Good job my man.
Never change.
