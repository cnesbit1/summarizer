Original Response: 
Haven't seen a Christina Ricci photo in a while.
How appropriate that today is Wednesday.
Sorry, I'll show myself out.
I have a few in reserve of her.
I will make a habit of posting a Christina Ricci every Wednesday I've decided.
You should, and see if anyone else notices the pattern and makes the correlation.
Shouldn't the bird tattoo be on the other side?
Is this photo reversed?
It would appear it is a reversed image.
Odd, I did pick up the tat but failed to notice it was a different side.http://i.imgur.com/Qex1PWV.png.

Summary:
