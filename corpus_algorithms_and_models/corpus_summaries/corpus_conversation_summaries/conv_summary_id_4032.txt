That figure is just amazing.
Thigh gap alert!
I've seen the pilot.
Don't do that.
It turned out to be okay overall, if you have nothing else to watch it might be enjoyable.
This is Cancer in television form.

It gets a lot better after the pilot.
It takes a few episodes, but once they introduce a pretty big DC character, it gets pretty good.
There are still some weak episodes, but if you've finished watching The Flash and want more superhero tv, it's worth watching.
That one scene wasn't the best, but the episode overall was actually pretty good.
Barry and Kara are super cute together.
You can't judge a show just from the pilot episode, especially since so many shows change so drastically from that first episode.
I would have been ok with this as a reimagining of the Supergirl suit.
Melissa being almost too adorable is probably one of the best things about the show.
