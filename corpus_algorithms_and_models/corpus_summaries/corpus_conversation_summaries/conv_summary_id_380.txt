Original Response: 
Happy New Year!
I found a very sweet and friendly male black kitten who needs a loving stable home to spend the rest of his life.
He has a very affectionate personality and would be a wonderful companion.
I wish I could keep him, but I have too many cats as it is.
I would be happy to provide scratchers, toys, and food for you.I've had him neutered and got his rabies shot taken care of.
He's litter box trained.
I just want to find a good home for the little guy.
He deserves it!If interested, please call me at 361-881-9103.

Summary: 
He has a very affectionate personality and would be a wonderful companion.
