I think (my opinion so don't yell) that Emily doesn't look as good in this pic.
Not bad, just not the most flattering.
Her Bones character is a bit too harsh, when they let her hair down for outside the lab she looks much better.
That said, I always liked Zooey better.
Could partly be the quirky characters she plays.
And now kiss!
Is this before Zooey's nose job?
Don't know about the picture, or even her before/after nose pics.
I just like her more.
Darker hair and blue eyes, those always good.
Oh ye definitely,  I like her in the new girl series.
Cool chica.
I would have never guessed that these two are sisters.
Genes are cool.
Same voice, similar eyes.

Summary: 
I just like her more.
