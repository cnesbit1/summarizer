Original Response: 
One of the huge value adds of Bitcoin, is the economic education.
But please do not stick to Austrian economics.
It's a based on heavily flawed assumptions (humans are egoists by nature, they make rational decisions all the time etc.
).
&gt;  It's a based on heavily flawed assumptions (**humans are egoists by nature**, **they make rational decisions all the time** etc.).
Can you please elaborate that?
Praxeology is heavily flawed, but the truth in their economic analysis remains true.
Probably not.
What is flawed about people engaging in saving and in the free exchange of goods and services in a market for agreed price, without govt interference and central bank monopoly fiat ?
That is Austrian Economics and most people who criticize that don't understand it.
The opposite, everything else, ensures that a person, committee or cabal inserts themselves into the free trade and allocates resources on your behalf.
Because they of course know better than you how to spend your hard earned money.
The grotesque arrogance of this is lost through the nice sounding caring platitudes that disguise it.
The greatest crimes in history have been committed under this ruse.
Austrian economics makes no such assumptions.
Mises frequently uses the word "rational" to describe human decision processes, but if you read up on his definition of "rational", you'll see that what he really means is "motivated" or "purposeful".
In short, the only thing that Austrians assume is that humans act by moving from states of lower perceived value (where value judgements are purely subjective and may take into account things like altruism) to states of higher perceived value (ex ante).
This assumption is not really disputable, as far as I'm concerned.
[Here's](https://mises.org/library/what-do-austrians-mean-rational) a link to an article on Austrian definition of rational action.
Yes.
&gt;The issue with Austrian economists, and libertarianism in general, has always been their sense of 'outcome ambivalence'.
They don't believe in "public goods."
They don't believe in nations (even their own).
What they do believe in is a set of rules.
Whatever happens to us because of those rules is irrelevant to them and is seen as part of 'le grand experiment'.
&gt;The Austrians get around the problems of market failures, natural monopolies, morality, and rationality through the use of pseudo-clever wordplay.
They rely on an extreme form of methodological individualism based on the "action axiom" as described above.
To wit: Because only individuals exist, only individuals can act.
Societies cannot act because, to quote Margaret Thatcher, "there is no such thing as society."
Therefore, all action can be described at the individual level.
If an action is good or moral for one individual, then it must be good or moral in the aggregate because good + good = good.
In reality, only basic game theory is needed in order to refute this.
[23] Austrians claim, for example, that savings represent money that will be invested in the future, and so money can never be "hoarded."
They entirely reject the paradox of thrift.
[24] A society is simply a group of individuals.
What "society acts" really means is that the individuals composing that group act.
Individuals can act to cooperate with other individuals.
If the Austrian argument were true, it would be impossible for an individual to perform transactions with other individuals; it would be impossible for an individual to cooperate with other individuals to form a business.
It would even be impossible for an individual to spread the ideas of Austrian economics to other individuals!
You can't tell anybody else about Austrian economics, because in doing so you have created a "society".
Clearly, society exists.
Austrians think they can get out of this by changing definitions when it suits them.
&gt;Some Austrians also use this idea as the basis for an ethical philosophy.
This is where they start mixing methodological individualism with methodological subjectivism.
As above, if all individual actions are moral, then their aggregate must be moral.
In other words, it's a logical derivation of ethical egoism.
[25]

&gt;This can be used to justify a number of absurdities.
Interestingly, the Austrians do not grant the assumption of homo economicus (i.e., that all investors and consumers are endowed with perfect or near-perfect information and rational decision-making skills).
However, they redefine "rationality" in subjective terms to mean acting in a way that will fulfill whatever the individual desires.
Thus, any action, whether common sense would define it as "rational" or "irrational," is actually "rational" as long as it has utility in meeting a person's needs.
This bit of handwaving is often used to deny the importance of self-destructive behavior.
That's why economists have no problem talking about "organ donor markets" and never actually question the ethics or implications, since that's for irrational socialist monsters.
That's how we end up with the Silk Road drug bazaar,[26] or the "crypto-assassination markets" nobody's supposed to ever talk about.
[27]

&gt;This also allows them to skirt around the creation of monopolies.
The Austrians believe that monopolies can only be sustained through government intervention as monopolistic profits and practices will always lead people to create a viable enterprise that will undercut the prices of the company with the monopoly.
If this does not happen, it's not because of barriers to entry or insider deals, it's because people must be happy enough with the monopoly at that time to continue paying its prices!
Monopolistic practices are not immoral, either, because business practices aren't "enforced at gunpoint" (i.e., the gubmint isn't forcing people to buy their stuff).
Why, if there's only one telephone provider in the world, no one's forcing you to use the phone.
You are "voluntarily" exchanging your money for their goods.
Don't like it?
Simple, string up duplicate wires across the entire globe and start your own phone company!
Or move to another world that is big enough to support more than one phone company.
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Austrian_school.
Their business cycle theory has been heavily debunked.
Even by the Chicago School.
Yes, they twist the definition of the word "rational" to fit their view of the world.
Market externalities/failures.
This is not a valid criticism, I'm afraid.
If you want to convince anyone, you should state your objections clearly, so that they can be discussed.
What's the problem with using the word "rational" as a technical term, as long as it's clearly defined?
I'm trying to convince people to not blindly believe into one, heavily criticized theory (often qualified as economic "theology").
And I'm blindly downvoted because everyone here are acting like sheep.
I wish Bitcoin wasn't tainted by right wing libertarianism or Austrian economics.
That's it.
I was expecting something **exactly** like that, sometimes I'm scared of myself...
Sorry but that's not Austrian school, what you've just quoted is the personal interpretation and the personal opinion of someone who reject the Austrian school and don't like it.
Instead of having a leftist explaining to you what is libertarianism and the Austrian school, go directly to the very source.
**READ HAYEK AND MISES** and don't let someone else explain them to you.
This way you can make conclusions by yourself and not just absorb conclusions from others.
It's rational wiki.
Not a leftist website.
But, yeah, you seem to not have any counter-argument anyway (that's what I thought too, god damn I scare myself sometimes).
Did *you* read Hayek and Mises ?
I'd suppose that no.
Like the majority of Austrian devotees, you probably just read one or two thing on the Mises institute website and read Libertarian blogs.
Why I'm not reading them ?
Because one thing that is commonly admitted is that their praxeology method is deeply flawed and that they refuse to even touch mathematical models and try to explain the economy by just "thinking" about it and came out with "we need less government".
Wow !
Deep.
I'm not saying that they don't say interesting stuff that you can think about, it's just that I don't want the Bitcoin sub to be Austrian economics devotee.
We already have a link to the Ancap sub (Seriously ?)
in the sidebar...
Don't act like a proud fool, I'm giving you the best advice you can get in life.
Forget rational wikis and go directly to the source, learn to learn by yourself.
Get your own conclusions and don't always believe others conclusions (they have bias too).
You can't say you know what austrian school is if you never read actual austrians, although this is extensible to anything really.
I have lots of counter-arguments but I'm not going to start a discussion about economics because I don't feel like it and english is not my native language, I struggle a lot in this kind of discussions.
Besides, Mises or Hayek would explain it to you much better than I can.
I'm also trying to warn people to not become devotees of a certain theory that is one of the most heavily politically tainted of our times (right beside Marxian economics).
I don't want Bitcoin to become a cesspool of right wing libertarians.
Theories try to explain things.
You can prove them wrong anytime, if you can.
If a theory happens to be true, why not to be devotee of it?
It's only natural for libertarians to feel love for Bitcoin, since it has a very strong component of libertarianism in it and that's undeniable.
It's all about taking the currency away from the state's hands.
It's all about zero inflation policy.
It's all about making the currency valuable again.
It's all about decentralization.
Bitcoin is rat poison for governments, and I think leftists crypto enthusiasts don't really understand what they're supporting.
It's pretty hard to see a leftist supporting gold as a currency, isn't it?
They can't understand it.
Same for Bitcoin.
They've been proven wrong on several points notably on praxeology and business cycle theory.
You probably don't understand the many components of leftism.
I perfectly understand Bitcoin and I think it goes way beyond the scope of the simplistic views of libertarian goldbugs.
You appear biased anyway.
Okay.
Good luck trying to set up any kind of redistribution-of-wealth-system based on violence in a cryptocurrencified society.
Watch out, Bitcoin is deflationary and Monero's out there... in the shadows.
\[*evil laugh\]*
&gt;redistribution-of-wealth-system based on violence  


Aah, the good old rhetoric :D. Stop being a fetishist of money and accept that these are just numbers and that it's necessary to a certain extent to redistribute it in a community as Capitalism tend to favor accumulation at the top.
It's not being violent, it's being realistic.
No one is pointing guns at you but if there was no repressive measures, then it also wouldn't work.
As cute as is right wing libertarianism, it's extremely utopian.
I feel sorry for you as you're probably living in a European welfare state that has paid for your education and numerous other public services paid by the community.
Now onto Bitcoin.
I think it will be used along other currencies.
It will be a counter power but not necessarily be taking over.
&gt;Stop being a fetishist of money and accept that these are just numbers and that it's necessary to a certain extent to redistribute it in a community as Capitalism tend to favor accumulation at the top.
Yes of course, stop being a fetishist of physics and go jump off a window and see if you can fly.
It's not my fault that you can't understand what money is and its importance.
When money stops being money what you have is Venezuela.
&gt;   It's not being violent, it's being realistic.
Yes, it's being violent.
What do you think it would happen to me if I refuse to pay my taxes?
uniformed and armed people from the government would come to my house to kidnap me and throw me in jail.
Maybe you think this is necessary, but you can't deny that this is violence.
&gt; No one is pointing guns at you but if there was no repressive measures, then it also wouldn't work.
As cute as is right wing libertarianism, it's extremely utopian.
Yes.
They're pointing guns at me as I explained before.
And I wonder how can you know how cute libertarianism can be and how utopian it is if you have never read an actual libertarian.
An utopia is like the horizon, you can go in that direction but you never get there.
Even if a complete libertarian society were impossible to achieve, we have to try to go in that direction: Less government, more free market.
Don't forget that we're living in brand new welfare states where we have redistribution of wealth mechanisms up and running... in exchange of having the highest public debt in history and the highest taxes in history, generally speaking.
Is this sustainable long term?
time will tell, but it certainly doesn't look good.
Your venerated welfare state might send us all to the middle ages at any time.
&gt; Now onto Bitcoin.
I think it will be used along other currencies.
It will be a counter power but not necessarily be taking over.
You're very naive.
If Bitcoin and other cryptos (especially the anonymous ones) succeed and become mainstream, governments will try to stop it.
Governments don't like counter powers or boundaries as they tend to expand its power indefinitely.
If you put at risk the capacity of the state to effectively gather taxes you will see a fierce response from the government to defend their business, even if they have to put Bitcoin users in jail.
I'm done trying to talk to childish right wing libertarians.
I have had this discussion countless times already and you'll never convince me.
Believe in your childish fantasies, stay in your dream world of a perfect free market or whatever.
Childish fantasies........ says the one who thinks he can enjoy forever a welfare sustained with historical levels of debt.
I show you real numbers and you tell me I'm dreaming, well, I don't think it's me the one who's dreaming.
Is there anything more childish than wanting someone to take complete care of you without having to worry about the economy?
Look, this is your crazy ideas failing real time: http://www.usdebtclock.org/world-debt-clock.html.
Haha yes I totally support a debt based society, that's totally what I said.
Damn, stop living in your world of Austrians vs statists or whatever, it's ridiculous.
Nevermind that it's the lack of regulation that sparked the subprime crisis in 2008.
Oh no wait under a "perfect free market" nothing like would have happened, right ?
Right ?
&gt; it's the lack of regulation that sparked the subprime crisis in 2008.
Don't forget that you're the one who don't read austrians, you let someone else explain to you what austrians say.
You believe and take for granted that in 2008 banks were not regulated, which is stupid, or you may believe that regulated things don't fail, which is stupid too.
Care to explain what particular regulations were needed in 2008 in order to avoid the subprime crisis?
I just want to make sure if you know what you're talking about or just repeating what someone told you.
I'm pretty you don't even read them either.
&gt; I just want to make sure if you know what you're talking about or just repeating what someone told you.
I'm so scared.
Look at the expert of 2008 crisis who's waiting to paste an entire text about how it's the government who caused it.
Well, it's still in debate (because you know, everyone is trying to find causes that fits their ideology) but the overwhelming majority, including Alan Greenspan and number of economists blamed the lack of regulation of investment banks.
&gt;Former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan, who many economists blamed for the financial crisis, testified in October 2008 that he had trusted free markets to self-correct and had not anticipated the risk of reduced lending standards.
"Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders' equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief."
