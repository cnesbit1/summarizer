Original Response: 
I heard even Denny's nearly got flooded.
If you have a Facebook, go to news 6 and check it out.
They got hammered bad, my SO sent me a picture from the news FB (I don't have FB) and I seen 4 cars floating.
That photo was crazy.
On my way home, coming from Portland using crosstown,  I saw cars abandoned surrounded with water.
Small cars with water up to the door handle.
When I get home I'll put some up.
If I remember correctly, a few people died in the flooding?
In Wimberly, I havent heard of any in Corpus.
No deaths in Corpus, it did get pretty bad.
A lot of vehicles were just covered.

Summary: 
Small cars with water up to the door handle.
