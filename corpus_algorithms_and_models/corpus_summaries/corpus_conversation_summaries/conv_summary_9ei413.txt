Original Response: 
I'm sure the current mod team would rather this be sent privately to them but I feel I need to stand up for Dong on this.
As some may know, a previous moderator /u/dong_magnum was [permanently banned from ecr](https://i.imgur.com/SoJxDKs.png) citing "appalling behavior".
Now I know Dong personally and can say there there is nothing to back up these claims.
The mods have been silent on providing proof despite claiming they have it.
On top of this, /u/_passafire_ was also banned in the same day.
I don't know if it were some personal vendetta but he was definitely active in ecr past his time as a moderator and seems to be without reason as well.
I mean no offense to the new batch of mods but 
My message to the mods is this: If you want to keep an active community around here, trust and transparency is a must.
Obviously I can't tell you how to run the sub but as a former mod here myself, seeing such heavy-handed actions without proper reasoning just makes me sad.
We don't want a sequel to weender.
You can ban me if you want, but frankly, that would just prove my point.
^^^^^^^^Also ^^^^^^^^you ^^^^^^^^guys ^^^^^^^^haven't ^^^^^^^^updated ^^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^^sidebar ^^^^^^^^pic ^^^^^^^^or ^^^^^^^^the ^^^^^^^^late ^^^^^^^^night ^^^^^^^^chat ^^^^^^^^gifsound ^^^^^^^^in ^^^^^^^^months.

When have I not been transparent?
~~Also you were the one who banned dong.~~

And like I said in the post, if you have proof, send it to dong.
&gt; I am waiting on some information regarding Dong and some allegations

so he has been banned based on unproved allegations?

You guys are doing a good job, I donâ€™t want it to come across as me saying you arenâ€™t.
But Iâ€™m sure a lot of the community would at least enjoy a post just saying that the mod team is still investigating and will post proof as soon as itâ€™s all been gathered.
Just an update to know that proof is coming, you know?
Just my two cents.
shouldn't he be provided with a better explanation than he has been given?
[deleted]
No shit we were targeting you.
At the time you were literally the most reported person on ECR.
You were fairly close to getting perma-banned on multiple occasions and we had to make a bot to clear you from the mod queue.
ðŸ‘€.
This is some juicy shit.
Oh wow.
Thatâ€™s fair enough I suppose.

How did he get to become a mod then?
[deleted]
This is a horrible look man :(
You're full of shit.
This reeks of a personal grudge.
You should just man up and admit it.
There's nothing anyone can do about it anyway.

/u/Lynda73 added the newest batch of mods pretty much without consent or consideration from the rest of the mod team.
If i'm being honest, that was pretty much the last nail in the coffin for me.
After that I tried my best to instruct them on how to manage the sub and then stepped down less than a week later pretty much right after dong.
I just know that he was not given a valid reason for why he was banned and I think he deserves at least that.
I'm not involved any further than that.

You have always overly scrubbed people's post history.
This isn't Facebook, it's Reddit.
It's all anonymous.
That's fine.
I'll use my real account.
[deleted]
Is it just me or have I never seen lynda73 post here ?
It's not just you.
Not gonna lie I just went through the mod list and umm Iâ€™ll admit I donâ€™t know who half the mods are some havenâ€™t posted or commented in anything on Reddit with said mod account in 6 months.
see: smallchanger.
100% agree.
u/Sychophantom BTW this is the guy who invented the ChuffTop.
[removed]
literally nobody cares.
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care.
[removed]
It seems people agree with me, though.
While I'll agree with you towards the end of it, I ran shit for years.
Without warning would be better wording for it.
I don't mean that as a slight against you guys.
And on inactivity, it's kind of telling that you're the only one replying so far.
[deleted]
Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night.
[deleted]
I care.
:(
[deleted]
And I appreciate you, boo.

Agree with what, it was deleted lol

Edit: I'm just commenting whenever I notice deleted stuff at this point.
Mods are deleting lots at the moment.
Yeah I don't want to get too involved because at the end of the day I want to be able to post on ECR.
The guy was disagreeing with a mod's definition of doxxing, which I also don't agree with.
Sycho didn't ban him.
Another mod did.
There is no personal grudge.
There is no way to explain why right now.
Once we get the OK to do that, we will.
He really wasn't the one who banned dong.
Fair enough, I'll retract that part.
Are we talking like child porn or something?
I keep seeing things like legal council, nature of the allegations, to protect those coming forward, etc.
I don't have a fucking clue what is going on but unless it is something fucking legit serious, like 3 letter agency serious, I think everyone is being a little over dramatic.
[deleted]
&gt; And finally, you talking transparency is really fucking hilarious, not to mention ironic.
This is pretty rich given that people have to use external websites to see removed comments to find out what exactly is going on.
~~Exposing~~ Making an allegation of an alt account =/= doxxing

is what was agreed with.
[deleted]
It's not CP, but it's for sure legit serious.
The fuck?
Power trip much?
Passafire as well?
Weâ€™ve been told several times in this thread weâ€™d get proof of what he did and havenâ€™t yet.
This just seems strange, both to get banned the same day for separate events.
[deleted]
Not everyone uses alts like you.
No.
Totally separate events.

When have I not been transparent?
