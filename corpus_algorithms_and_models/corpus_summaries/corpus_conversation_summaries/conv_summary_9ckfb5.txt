There is great sexual power in knowing that your partner can be attracted to someone else (and obviously vice versa), but that they still come home to be intimate with you and you only.
You can acknowledge it and then prioritize your own sex life to being more than "Maybe we'll do this if we're not too tired."
Think of how much sexual energy you guys could have shared last night.
Some of the best sex I have ever had has resulted from similar situations.
Your cousin's girlfriend is missing one key attribute.
She isn't you.
😱😭 I love you right now!
I love this perspective, and that last line is **powerful**.
My husband has *you* to thank for how I’m going to jump him tonight!
Edit: tried to fix what’s bold, but now Reddit is the one who is drunk.

Not really, it is plain disrespect... they come to you because you're there.
The person who has the power is the one being lusted over.
The things people tell themselves .
..


And the idea that op should be the body her husband fucks while thinking of the other woman is probably one of the least self respecting things I can  imagine a person doing.
Thank you for this comment.
Having a sex love based on attraction to other people sounds horribly exhausting and SO demeaning for a woman.
I bet everyone comes to stand beside of you at all the parties.
I would always say that being a fantasy and source of arousal is the compliment, while serving as a hole to stick it into (or a dick to fill a hole) is a slap in the face.

Right?
Demanding respect and fidelity in one’s sex life is just *so* unfun.
Who wants to hang out with someone so *monogamous?
* /s.
I am starting to think a lot of men are insecure losers and do this on purpose to make their partners feel like shit.
They will claim it’s an “accident” or they didn’t know it would hurt their partner’s feelings.. yeah right.
They know what they are doing.
Like they muse over another woman as a way to put their partner down and say shit “hey she’s a 10..  but I love you and am with you and can have sex with you and not her!!”.
It’s incredibly insulting, especially if you’re a woman who tries to keep up her looks.
They do it even to attractive women.
They do, because I'm not going to flirt with their husbands.
All kinds of things can spark a sudden boost in someone's libido.
Taking that sexual energy and pouring it into your relationship is better than developing a fantasy around another person that negates the relationship and dropping sex with your spouse to masturbate over the fantasy of someone else.
Making a situation taboo drives it underground where it can fester and develop into a deeper fixation.
Giving a spouse room to admit "yeah, I think ___ is hot and I've got a little crush" means it's given light, you can speak openly about boundaries without being gaslit with denials that no feelings exist, and ultimately both partners can use the reminder that other attractive people are out there to infuse a little more passion into their day after a period of being so settled into routines that they maybe took each other for granted.
I think it's unhealthy if the only sex happens when a third person enters the picture and if the spouse is ignored during a fixation on a new crush, but it's not bad if it's something that is acknowledged and the spouse with a crush makes sure to put in the effort to show their husband or wife is the person they love and adore more than any temporary excitement over a crush.
Have to agree with this.
I've had to put up with it so many times.
It is just exhausting and can ruin a whole day together.
I cant stand feeling like #2.

/u/queefiequeen didn’t get roasted, she got dipped in flour, egg, breadcrumbs, and then deep fried in vegetable oil at 350 degrees.
Yeah I get that intellectually, but it is actually a fantasy of mine.
I don't know how I'd handle it in reality, but in my head it is hot af.
I guess I have no self respect.
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.

Summary: 
They know what they are doing.
