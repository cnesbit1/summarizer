Linking personal information is a bannable offence.
This isn't the place to start a witchhunt.
What personal info did I link?
Linking both the usernames and the comments themselves fall under the umbrella of "personal information".
In future, please read the sidebar before posting.
How when its a reddit account and its a username and some comments that person made?
You can’t find out their real identity from anything I linked.
As I have already explained, no real names and no usernames.
Maybe the issue is I’m having trouble understanding how a *fake name* constitutes personal information

But I think what you’re trying to explain is you don’t want the person to be identifiable at all.
In this case I would suggest rewording of the rule a bit as your concern is backlash against the individual.
&gt;2) Do not post any identifiable information, names, or usernames.
This is a bannable offence.
This includes social media profiles and Reddit accounts.
It's pretty clear, you just need to read the rules.
Gotcha.
