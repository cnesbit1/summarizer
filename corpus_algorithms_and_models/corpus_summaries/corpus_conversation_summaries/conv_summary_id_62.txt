A few hours ago my male tri color corgi got off his leash near Everhart and Saratoga.
Large reward if found or if you lead to him being found!
Any help greatly appreciated.Thanks guys.
I hope you find your corgi!
Have you tried the lost pet hotline or Craigslist?
If you have pics post em and I'll try fb?
