No dinosaur is "more closely related" to reptiles than others - that would imply they descended from more than one common ancestor; it's like saying your brother is more closely related to your cousin than your sister.
All dinosaurs are as close to reptiles as however close their shared common ancestor was.

I was rewatching walking with dinosaurs a few months back, and they suggested that sauropods did it from behind with the Male on top - like most quadrupedal animals today.
I think they suggested that females had reinforced hip and spine bones to help them support the males weight.
Also that it didn‚Äôt last very long.
Though this was a TV show made nearly 20 years ago (which took an amount of artistic license) so the scientific consensus may well have changed since then.
Edit: here‚Äôs the link to the clip (https://youtu.be/-mv_v4ltSrY).
Again this is a 20 year old show, but it positioned itself as a natural history documentary programme.

Sauropods have [had] fused vertebrae around the hips, and it's speculated that the reason for this is to support the weight of the male during mating.

Well then.
Birds are dinosaurs, so everything we know about birds falls under the purview of your question.
However, for extinct forms, we can also make inferences using a technique known as [phylogenetic bracketing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_bracketing).
Dinosaurs are [archosaurs](http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/what-are-archosaurs/), the two living representatives of which are crocodylians and birds (see also our [FAQ on why birds are dinosaurs](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/biology/birds_are_dinosaurs)).
If there's a character that both groups have, it was likely present in their common ancestor.
Things like a four chambered heart (which evolved independently from the mammalian heart), [unidirectional airflow in the lungs](http://mappingignorance.org/2013/03/29/triassic-lungs-unidirectional-flow-in-alligators-breathing/), and nest-building/parental care are present in both birds and crocodylians, so they were probably present in their common ancestor.
That means extinct dinos likely had those traits or lost them secondarily.
We have fossils that confirm these some of inferences, like brooding of nests.
Interestingly, we've also recently found that alligators are monogamous over multiple mating seasons, as are many birds, so that could have implications for how we look at extinct archosaur behavior.
Alligators will also show nest site fidelity, coming back to the same or nearby areas over multiple nesting seasons.
Many crocs have [complex mating rituals](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/alligator-mating-physics/) as well, so these also seem to be ancestral to archosaurs.
As far as dinosaur reproduction goes, we've found a lot of similarities between the reproductive tracts in birds and crocs.
For example, [alligators and birds form eggshells in similar ways](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1547315).
Most ["reptiles"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropsida) have [hemipenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis), which are paired copulatory organs that are everted for mating.
This is not true of archosaurs.
Most birds have lost their penis, but some retained it (ducks and ratites like ostriches and emus are two examples).
I don't know of any fossil dinosaur genitalia, but birds (those that have a phallus) and crocs each have a single phallus rather than the hemipenes of extant lepidosaurs.
That's likely what other extinct archosaurs probably had.
However, given the range in variation that we see in living birds alone, I'm sure dinosaur genitalia existed in all shapes and sizes.
In short:

- Dinosaurs probably ancestrally had penises similar to crocodylians and some birds, but they could have been lost in lineages like they were in many bird groups.
- At least some brooded their nests.
- They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do.
- Some may have been monogamous over multiple mating seasons like many birds and crocs.
[This article](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2012/02/the-anatomy-of-dinosaur-sex/) similarly covers these topics.
Thank you for this answer, I knew the question wasn‚Äôt fully answered, but you‚Äôve pointed me in the direction of what we do know and can infer from study of living animals.
I will follow the links üëçüèº.
[removed]
Thank you!
This was fascinating.
One thing I never understood about this- 

Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but at the same time dinosaurs went extinct, probably through an asteroid striking the earth or something.
So wouldn't that mean that there are many dinosaur species that don't have living descendents?
If they went extinct they couldn't evolve right?
[removed]
Birds are only a specific branch of dinosaurs, and the only branch that survived...think of it like this:  Imagine all mammals went extinct except for a handful of species of bats.
Then 65 million years from now there are still a bunch of bats flying around, descendants of those few species of surviving bats  But none of the other mammals left descendants.
Birds are like the bats of dinosaurs.
Reading your comment made me realize that for the most part I have no idea how birds or crocodiles/alligators mate, just that they lay eggs.
I never even thought about the subject until you asked this very important question.
Extinct is one of those complex terms, I joked to a friend once that humans stopped evolving not because of any biological process but because we are to vain to call ourselves anything else.
My question would be more what dinosaurs did birds evolve from and did all birds come from one group.
There is definitely a line that probably looks like gallimimus(butchered name), moa, ostrich and emu.
But what about chickens, peacocks etc.
Did different group of birds come from different dino stocks.
Wait can different bird types mate?
Yes, extinct is not as simple as it would seem, and becomes less so as you widen the class of life which you claim has gone extinct.
While trying to stay on topic - would the genitalia be covered or retracted?
[removed]
[removed]
Generally, the family of dinosaurs called the Theropods are the only ones likely to have evolved into modern birds.
So sauropods (like the giant plant eaters) and most other dinosaur families do not have any living relatives.
Here's a family tree of the dinosaurs.
http://everythingdinosaurs.wikia.com/wiki/File:Dino_Family_Tree.gif.
To answer that last question: no, different bird species are almost always non-interfertile.
The general rule is dogs, cats, horses and cattle can generally breed among variants of their own species, but birds, fish, and lizards cannot.
Reading about the unidirectional lung system was really fascinating.
I had a hard time picturing such a thing at first, but your link does a great job of explaining it.
Birds are dinosaurs, full stop.
They‚Äôre theropod dinosaurs in the same way monkeys are all mammals.
Not all dinosaurs are birds, so many groups of dinosaurs are extinct and don‚Äôt have living representatives.
But yes, dinosaurs aren‚Äôt extinct.
That extinction event wiped out a lot of things that weren‚Äôt dinosaurs, and it didn‚Äôt kill all the dinosaurs.
It‚Äôs far more complex than is popularly portrayed, and we don‚Äôt fully understand the patterns we see.
In case anyone was as confused by the physiology of breathing in birds as I was

http://bcs.whfreeman.com/webpub/Ektron/Hillis%20Principles%20of%20Life2e/Animated%20Tutorials/pol2e_at_3101_Airflow_in_Birds/pol2e_at_3101_Airflow_in_Birds.html.
If it‚Äôs like moderns birds or crocs, retracted.
Assuming a phallus is present.
It‚Äôs one of my favorite things!
That unidirectional airflow has since been found in some lizard groups, so it‚Äôs not just unique to archosaurs.

Your brooding of nests link redirects me to some website called rebel mouse.
It seems like it should go to the discovery website, does it work for you or is there something wrong with the link?
[removed]
Wait, so birds are lizard-hipped dinosaurs, not bird-hipped dinosaurs?
!
Birds aren't descended from dinosaurs --- they *are* dinosaurs.
They're the one group of dinosaur species that wasn't wiped out, and since then they've diversified and flourished.
Take a look at the second paragraph of the wikipedia article on birds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird):

&gt; Reverse genetic engineering[3] and the fossil record both demonstrate that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs.
EDIT: Also, it's kinda cool that that means that some of the most intelligent living animals are dinosaurs.
*‚ÄúBirds are like the bats of dinosaurs.‚Äù*

I love this response because it is not only informative for the posed question, but it also lays out the whole reasoning and research process that allows to form these conclusions.

Edit - thank you for the reply.
But by definition if there were still a handful of species of bats, then mammals wouldn't be technically extinct, no?
Crocodiles are not dinosaurs, though.

Makes me wonder of the physical mechanics for very large dinosaurs.
Moving such a large tail out of the way and a male being able to mount.
Seems unimaginable.
Yes, that is my issue with that theory... the vertebrae of sauropods did not allow a large angle of movement at each joint... it‚Äôs unlikely they would physically be able to mover the tail out of the way, not entirely anyhow.
Perhaps subtending a small angle to the side would suffice.
There's plenty of evidence of birds thinking, especially corvids.
Chickens are usually raised for foo so they're not typically mentally stimulated like pets.
[deleted]
Maybe they were fertilized by other methods then direct intercourse.
My first thought is how, for example Salmon breed.
Well yeah, but that usually requires the medium of water for several reasons.

Lots of mammals do.
It‚Äôs called a baculum.

Aren't crocodiles more closely related to dinosaurs than reptiles?
At least that's what Wikipedia says.
Sure, but dinosaurs aren't technically extinct either since birds are around.
But future squid people or whatever might define bats as their own thing and not realize they are really the same thing as those big bones of extinct elephants and cows and wolves they dig up...which is what happened with birds and dinosaurs.
I think of extinct as "gone".
Is it fair to say it is a misunderstanding to say dinosaurs are extinct when their "descendants" have been trotting about for millions of years after?
Oh for sure, was just using it as an example that maybe there was a method which we cannot really figure out from the current data we have.
Yeah that‚Äôs always a possibility alright.
There was a research topic posted at reddit some time ago, perhaps a year or two, that pointed out that genetic analysis and fossil evidence shows that several lineages of birds, at least four, survived through the K-P extinction event.
It kind of blew my mind because I had always thought the diversification of birds happened later.
The big question, that we really don't have a good answer to, is why several species of birds, some of them not very flight-worthy (chickens, for instance), survived the extinction event, but non-avian theropod dinosaurs did not.
What were the key differences that made the avians capable of surviving and the terror beasts not so much?
From the descent, it appears that only one species each of monotremes, marsupials, and mammals survived.
That too is curious.

Im a bit sad, tho, I had never heard of a fossilized nest or a fossilized female that was clearly brooding.
Really wanted to read more about it.
And as a more cultural aside, there is [a theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum#Cultural_significance) that the story of Adam losing his "rib" was to culturally explain why this bone is missing in humans.
Crocodiles and dinosaurs, along with a number of other extinct groups, form a group called Archosauria.
The only living members of this group are crocodylians and birds, the latter of which are dinosaurs.
All of them are reptiles, along with some other groups.
Crocodiles are not dinosaurs.
[removed]
[Here](http://preparation.paleo.amnh.org/57/oviraptor) is some information on a brooding oviraptor.
They were called oviraptors, which means ‚Äúegg thief‚Äù because they were found near eggs they were presumed to be stealing for a meal.
Turns out they‚Äôre just awesome parents.
üò¢.
Oh!
Yeah I totally thought they ate eggs, too.
Thanks for the link!
Yes, as I‚Äôve said, crocodylians and dinosaurs (including birds) are each others‚Äô closest living relatives.
They make a single, united group called Archosauria, to the exclusion of other reptiles.
This is not ‚Äúbirds and dinosaurs‚Äù.
Birds *are* dinosaurs.
Crocs are not dinosaurs.
That is not an arbitrary answer.
&gt;They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do.
This has actually been discovered:

[Theropod courtship: large scale physical evidence of display arenas and avian-like scrape ceremony behaviour by Cretaceous dinosaurs](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep18952) 

At least for theropods.
Yes, it‚Äôs wrong to say that dinosaurs are extinct.
Birds aren‚Äôt just descendants of dinosaurs, they‚Äôre dinosaurs.
If you study dinosaur anatomy, you will see it in birds.
So much of what they do just screams ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù.
Their long, S-shaped necks, different bone fusions and digit reduction, their hip anatomy.
They‚Äôre maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs, and it‚Äôs super awesome.
Yes, don't let the names confuse you.
The lizard-hipped dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds, bird-hipped dinosaurs aren't.
&gt;maniraptoran theropod

Nice.
Roosters and hens both have cloacas - one reproductive and waste tract.
Based on the post above, we might infer something about dinosaur mating from chickens.
Here's a description ([source, emphasis added](https://animals.mom.me/reproductive-system-of-a-rooster-7896371.html)) 

**Reproductive Process**

**When a rooster mates with a hen, he will climb on top of her back and place a foot on each of her wings, forcing her tail feathers upward so he can press his cloaca to hers.
** The rooster ejaculates and transfers the sperm, and he hops off.
*Often he will perform a victory dance of sorts, hopping around and strutting*, while the hen unruffles her feathers, flaps her wings and walks away.

Aves is simply the crown group of birds.
When you look at the larger group Avialae, you see an awful lot of birdlike creatures that are extinct, so it‚Äôs not as clean as *things that looked like birds did fine*.
I‚Äôm not sure how other members of Avialae track with the K-Pg, but I wouldn‚Äôt characterize everything other than crown-group birds as ‚Äúterror beasts‚Äù (which I realize is an English translation of ‚ÄúDinosauria‚Äù).
Other avialans are just as birdy as Aves, and in fact if you ran into a non-avian eumaniraptoran on the street, chances are, your brain would think ‚Äúbird!‚Äù 

Squamates survived, but groups like mosasaurs were lost.
Pterosaurs had declined in diversity, but the remaining pterosaurs didn‚Äôt cross the K-Pg boundary.
Lots of crocodyliform groups were lost.
Monotremes and marsupials are all mammals.
We normally talk at higher than the species level for these events, because single species are generally too short-lived to be a good indication.
Groups like monotremes, multituberculates, gondwanatheres, metatherians (including marsupials), and eutherians all cross the boundary, but I think some groups were lost and some regions were impacted more than others.
They were sometimes used by indigenous tribes the craft tools and weapons.
When fashioned into a club, I like to call them ‚Äúwhackulums.‚Äù

Yi qi?
It‚Äôs a shame that some educators are not privy to this fact.
I remember my son coming home disappointed from elementary school because the teacher stated very firmly that dinosaurs are extinct, and he told her ‚Äúuh, no they‚Äôre not, birds are dinosaurs‚Äù (as I had taught him), and she disagreed.
Should have seen her face when I showed her the research.
There's a lot of hybridisation within birds of prey.
Most commonly it's people mixing various species of falcons, but in recent years a few breeders have manged to create even more unusual hybrids within accipitridae, like harris hawk X golden eagles, and goshawk X red tail hawks.
Monogamy in nature has always puzzled me.
Wouldn't it be better to mate with as many different individuals as possible to increase genetic diversity?
What are the evolutionary advantages to monogamy?
Isn't there some debate about the accuracy of our species divide between goshawks and redtails?
Hadn't heard about the harris x golden eagles though, that's fascinating.
Any of the resulting hybrids fertile?
Gee, I have a pair of geese that are an inter-species couple (the female is Anser Anser and the male Anser Cygnoides) and they breed just fine.
And not only that, the hybrid offspring appear to be fertile, too!
&gt;Isn't there some debate about the accuracy of our species divide between goshawks and redtails?
Not sure about that, I'm a falconer not an ornithologist, but redtails have always looked pretty buteo like to me.
&gt;Hadn't heard about the harris x golden eagles though, that's fascinating.
Any of the resulting hybrids fertile?
I don't know to be honest[, this is the website of the first breeder to do it successfully](http://ssraptorbreeding.com/index.php/raptors/harris-eagle)
Do we have any evidence of there ever being hermaphroditic and/or sex changing dinos?
I can't recall and im short on time to google, but i'm sure i've heard about some seahorses (and maybe even frogs?)
that can change their sex to meet shortcomings in their mating ratios male:female.
Yes, they could've only evolved from non-extinct species.
There have actually been multiple mass extinction events (one of which was a global rise in temperature and release of greenhouse gas through natural means) throughout the history of the Earth where a majority of all species were wiped out, leaving all we see to have evolved from what was left.
There was one actually where all but 5% of the world's species died out.
It's very interesting and worth looking up.
[removed]
The main confusion about dinosaurs being extinct comes from the fact that, back when dinosaurs were discovered, people didn't realize yet that birds were a type of dinosaur.
So "dinosaurs" were extinct.
But then we realized that birds are a kind of dinosaur so properly speaking they aren't actually extinct.
I don‚Äôt know how that could be considered an explanation.
It makes as little sense as a woman being crafted from any other part.
Less sense, actually.
Since all the mammals that possess penis bones have females in their species, I can‚Äôt see any logic to it physically or metaphorically.
[removed]
I‚Äôm not a bird guy, so I couldn‚Äôt tell you which species specifically, but I know that those notorious problem solving abilities extends beyond just crows and parrots.
Even much smaller birds with even tinier brains can rival primates in some tastes.
Dinosaur mating displays have never crossed my mind before.
After this I'll probably be thinking of dancing dinosaurs for years.
Thank you, or damn you?
We'll see!
That‚Äôs my backup.

Maybe plants would have been a better metaphor, because they reproduce in the open air with a puff of pollen.
Although it seems unlikely that dinosaur males would create clouds of pseudo-pollen sperm that female dinosaurs would walk through.
That sounds like a great washing powder ad.
I suppose prehensile penises are possible... that‚Äôs essentially what ducks do.

I want to add that birds don't show up well in the fossil record because they have weaker bones that don't hold up as well over millions of years.
So the link between true birds and the larger group of dinosaurs is a little hazier than you would expect from another group, say mammals.
We have a better record for the evolution of mammals (heavily based in jawbones and teeth) than we do for birds.
In fact, teeth are so important that one group of proto-mammals, the cynodonts, are named after how they were first identified:

New Teeth.
They have diverse teeth instead of a more reptilian single tooth which is just repeated over and over.
We could look at teeth for birds, too--when did dinosaurs start losing their teeth and getting true beaks?
It's hard to tell because it's harder to find those teeth without a skeleton along with them.
What books do I need to read to learn more about this topic?
As in, probably textbooks?
I'm a junior bio student.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever tasted a primate.
Tastes like chicken?
I never said they were?
You were the one who used birds and crocodiles to talk about archosaurs and thus make inferences about dinosaurs.
Hippos and bats aren't humans either, but all three are examples of mammals just as birds, crocodiles, and dinosaurs are all (based on your comment) archosaurs.
I see from your flair that you are an actual scientist.
I definitely am not, so I defer to your expertise of course, but my analogy seemed like a good way to contextualize what you were saying.
Sorry if I was mistaken.
Tl;dr - I thought archosaur : bird/dinosaur/crocodile :: mammal : bat/human/hippo

Edit - thinking about it, crocodiles aren't dinosaurs, but birds are.
So maybe a more apt comparison would be primates: apes, humans, and baboons?
It's kind of interesting to think about it that way since humans are obviously apes so it seems redundant.
Is that how you feel when people ask you questions about dinosaurs as though birds don't belong to that group?
[removed]
[removed]
Thanks, that was helpful.
Life was also far less diverse back then.
What we‚Äôve gathered from fossils so far shows a huge lack in biodiversity.
Now whether that is a result of remains failing to be preserved or because of an actual lack could be up for debate.
However we all share common ancestors.
Ultimately we‚Äôre all descended from this one type of fish that got uppity and developed early limbs.
Though I would like to question the conclusion being based on crocodiles.
Crocodiles existed at the same time as the dinosaurs so it‚Äôs possible that their habits and anatomy were very different from their far larger cousins.

Generally speaking, a chicken on a farm has little chance to demonstrate intelligence.
People who have deliberately interacted with chickens to study them have had different results.
&gt;[The birds were significantly more likely to peck at the second key, which offered a greater food reward but after a longer delay time.
In other words, they showed self-control ‚Äì a trait that some biologists think hints at a degree of self-awareness.

Thank you for these links!
idk if you‚Äôd know but how does an animal lose a penis?
i know that millions of years of evolution can have drastic changes, but at what point does that genitalia  disappear and how are they able to then reproduce without it if thats how they had been reproducing for so long?
evolutions coming from mutations is basically the extent of my knowledge on that stuff lol so just curious.
The ‚ÄúUnidirectional flow‚Äù is interesting, but I am having trouble picturing how it works, even with the schematics in the paper.
Do you know of a mobile friendly animated version on the web somewhere?
I saw a site that might have it, but its flash, and does not work on mobile devices.
Are all birds like that, or do some species breath more like mammals?

Birds very likely evolved from either the troodontid line, the dromaeosaur line (raptors like Velociraptor), or something very, very close.
All of those dinosaurs were almost completely feathered and had proto-wings which were not used for flight, but did have a very similar shape.
https://emilywilloughby.com/gallery/paleoart/dakotaraptor.
Chickens didn't survive the extinction event.
They weren't around, dude.
They were domesticated from the jungle fowl long after humans left Africa.
Did you think dodos also survived this event?
It is very important to realize that each era has its own set of species.
Some have longer reigns than others, but in no way were there any modern vertebrate species around before the end-Cretaceous extinction.
I'm currently reading Steve Brusatte's new book, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs, which is lighter than I'd like but is still giving me new information on lots of things (not that I'm a professional dinosaurist or anything, just an enthusiast)
I cracked up at your ‚ÄúWell then‚Äù haha thanks.
Which topic specifically?
[removed]
Thank you.
Very interesting.
No, different bird types can't mate.
That's like asking can different mammal types mate.
You are more closely related to a cow than a parrot is to a chicken.
[removed]
It seems like none of the living descendants do anything like how salmon reproduce.
From what the OP said about phylogenetic bracketing, it sounds like it's unlikely that dinosaurs would have done something similar... but evidently, bird sex doesn't lack for variety.
That said, there weren't really aquatic dinosaurs.
There were large reptiles like Plesiosaurs, or dinosaurs documented to be close enough to water to use it as a food source (Baryonyx).
I'd suspect something would need to be primarily aquatic to have a water-based reproductive method.
[removed]
Isn't it elephants and other weird mammals who have prehensile penises ?
I thought duck had either no penis at all or a single-use, grow-back-after-a-while explosive airbag penis ?
Erm... nope, they have a very long reusable one.
We seem to be both right, apparently it doesn't fall off after every intercourse, but it falls off after every breeding season, then they have to regrow one.
Ah, interesting ... weird nature.
Hmm, probably evolutionary history of mammals in relation to the noted extinction event.
I have never come across the term gondwanatherians or multituberculates before, for example.

In fact, Gallus, the genus that includes chickens, did survive the K-Pg extinction event.
See this [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15253).
Yes, I understand that the modern species of chicken wasn't around then.
But their ancestors, recognizably very similar to the modern species, were filling the same niches and did survive the event.
I'd like to discuss further, but I actually have hand problems from using the phone.

&gt; ).
If there's a character that both groups have, it was likely present in their common ancestor.
Just to be clear, isn't it the case that it's only true phylogenetic bracketing when the extinct species is descendant from the last common ancestor of the two extant species?
(E.g., there is a more recent node on the phylogenetic tree from which birds and crocodiles descend, and the argument applies to dinosaurs that are also descendants of that node.)
In particular, it is *not* the case (as one might mistakenly infer from your language above) that if an extinct species has two extant descendants then anything shared by those descendants was also probably present in the extinct species.
I‚Äôm not sure what you mean.
You look at taxa that are more basal and more derived with respect to the taxon of interest.
If a trait is present in both taxa of your bracket, you can infer that it was present in the common ancestor of both groups *and* not lost in the descendants of that common ancestor.
This allows you to generate hypotheses about traits that you can‚Äôt directly observe, and it can inform future work.
One example would be parental care in non-avian dinosaurs.
Both crocodylians and birds exhibit parental care of their young, and we now have [examples of this behavior in non-avian dinosaurs](https://naturalhistory.si.edu/exhibits/backyard-dinosaurs/how-did-dinosaurs-behave.cfm).
Obviously this isn‚Äôt going to work all of the time, and with a group as diverse as Archosauria, we know there will be a ton of variation.
Beyond that, I‚Äôm not sure what you mean.
What more recent recent common ancestor exists of crocodylians and birds?

Ron Embleton did some illustrations depicting said act.
They were published in Omni Magazine (there's a name I haven't heard in a while!)
back a few decades ago

Thanks... not sure how the postures in the diagrams were researched its something else to look at anyway :)

It's kind of funny isn't that most people probably don't realize that some version of rear entry or "doggy style" has been pretty well the norm for millions of years and "missionary position" is a fairly recent discovery in the grand scheme of things.

Us insisting on walking upright brought about the change.
We humans prefer facial cues.
Monkeys like the butt.
Wow they found 2 complete dinosaur skeletons in the "doing it" position?
He saw the asteroid and said "One last time?"

There's a theory that the reason we're the only one of our evolutionary relatives to have prominent breasts outside of pregnancy and breastfeeding is that they hit the same visual cue that day azz did in our quadruped ancestors.
They are a proxy bum.
A parabooty, if you will...
I uploaded scans from the Omni issue in question...

I did hear that and that lipstick is to imitate a swollen vulva as well.
So a woman with a push up bra and injected lips with day-glo lip stick is basically, trying to look like the backside of a baboon.
So you‚Äôre saying that men find blow jobs so stimulating from a visual standpoint because it looks like regular sex with the addition of eye contact?

Is that pose accurate?
Wouldn't the cloaca be much further behind the legs?
Can they even really bend their tails upwards like that?

Summary: 
Birds are like the bats of dinosaurs.
Crocodiles are not dinosaurs, though.
Birds are dinosaurs, full stop.
Birds aren't descended from dinosaurs --- they *are* dinosaurs.
I think of extinct as "gone".
I never said they were?
Birds aren‚Äôt just descendants of dinosaurs, they‚Äôre dinosaurs.
That's likely what other extinct archosaurs probably had.
I removed the link and I‚Äôll look for a replacement.
But yes, dinosaurs aren‚Äôt extinct.
If you study dinosaur anatomy, you will see it in birds.
Wait, so birds are lizard-hipped dinosaurs, not bird-hipped dinosaurs?
Sorry if I was mistaken.
Thank you for these links!
Are all birds like that, or do some species breath more like mammals?
Yes, it‚Äôs wrong to say that dinosaurs are extinct.
So far 80% of the comments have been removed.
- They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do.
Wait can different bird types mate?
Here's a family tree of the dinosaurs.
&gt;They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do.
The only living members of this group are crocodylians and birds, the latter of which are dinosaurs.
If it‚Äôs like moderns birds or crocs, retracted.
My question would be more what dinosaurs did birds evolve from and did all birds come from one group.
The lizard-hipped dinosaurs are the ancestors of birds, bird-hipped dinosaurs aren't.
I will follow the links üëçüèº.
Aves is simply the crown group of birds.
Birds are dinosaurs, so everything we know about birds falls under the purview of your question.
Generally, the family of dinosaurs called the Theropods are the only ones likely to have evolved into modern birds.
Chickens didn't survive the extinction event.
Not all dinosaurs are birds, so many groups of dinosaurs are extinct and don‚Äôt have living representatives.
They‚Äôre theropod dinosaurs in the same way monkeys are all mammals.
Sure, but dinosaurs aren't technically extinct either since birds are around.
Though I would like to question the conclusion being based on crocodiles.
Aren't crocodiles more closely related to dinosaurs than reptiles?
*‚ÄúBirds are like the bats of dinosaurs.‚Äù*

Thanks!
One example would be parental care in non-avian dinosaurs.
That's like asking can different mammal types mate.
I appreciate that you think I achieved it!
No, different bird types can't mate.
That said, there weren't really aquatic dinosaurs.
Dinosaur mating displays have never crossed my mind before.
I see from your flair that you are an actual scientist.
If there's a character that both groups have, it was likely present in their common ancestor.
So wouldn't that mean that there are many dinosaur species that don't have living descendents?
Thanks for letting me know!
But then we realized that birds are a kind of dinosaur so properly speaking they aren't actually extinct.
There's a lot of hybridisation within birds of prey.
I had no clue what I was going to be for Halloween this year until just now.
It‚Äôs one of my favorite things!
I‚Äôve used that link before, so I didn‚Äôt check it again.
Yes, I understand that the modern species of chicken wasn't around then.
After this I'll probably be thinking of dancing dinosaurs for years.
Based on the post above, we might infer something about dinosaur mating from chickens.
Lots of crocodyliform groups were lost.
Thank you, or damn you?
I don‚Äôt know how that could be considered an explanation.
That means extinct dinos likely had those traits or lost them secondarily.
Makes me wonder of the physical mechanics for very large dinosaurs.
You were the one who used birds and crocodiles to talk about archosaurs and thus make inferences about dinosaurs.
Is that how you feel when people ask you questions about dinosaurs as though birds don't belong to that group?
Crocodiles and dinosaurs, along with a number of other extinct groups, form a group called Archosauria.
What more recent recent common ancestor exists of crocodylians and birds?
Monotremes and marsupials are all mammals.
There's plenty of evidence of birds thinking, especially corvids.
They‚Äôre maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs, and it‚Äôs super awesome.
That extinction event wiped out a lot of things that weren‚Äôt dinosaurs, and it didn‚Äôt kill all the dinosaurs.
Tl;dr - I thought archosaur : bird/dinosaur/crocodile :: mammal : bat/human/hippo

Edit - thinking about it, crocodiles aren't dinosaurs, but birds are.
Did different group of birds come from different dino stocks.
All of them are reptiles, along with some other groups.
You should just call me.
- Some may have been monogamous over multiple mating seasons like many birds and crocs.
We have fossils that confirm these some of inferences, like brooding of nests.
