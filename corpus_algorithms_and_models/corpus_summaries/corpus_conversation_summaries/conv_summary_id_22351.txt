I really like this girl.
She needs to try and make a move into acting.
hot but is htis a celeb?
looks like some instagram model.
Is she Rachel Leigh cook?
From "she's all that"
Exactly what she is - not a celeb in the sense that this sub suggests.
In the early days people often chose their names based on their profession.
Blacksmiths became Smith's, leather workers became Tanner's and chefs became Cook's.
So it's not a matter of choosing her last name.
It's a matter of her being born with it.

Summary: 
hot but is htis a celeb?
It's a matter of her being born with it.
