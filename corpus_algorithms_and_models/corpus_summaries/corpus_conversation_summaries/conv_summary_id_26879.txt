Iconic Jennifer ... 20 years old, gorgeous good looks, incredible T and A .... never tire of looking at this beautiful woman.
Self restraint.
Is that the crooked cop Scarf from Luke Cage?
I went to see this movie in the theatre for one reason.
I knew it would be terrible.
This movie was terrible.

Could be worse.
I saw Howard The Duck in the theater because Lea Thompson was in it and it had a PG-13 rating.
Very disappointing.
Had to look up Luke Cage because I've never seen it, but yes, that's Frank Whaley who plays that character.
I saw Showgirls in the theater.
It was just what I thought I wanted... at first... then it got boring... then it got annoying... then it became so ridiculous that I came back around to enjoying it.

There aren't many people who can say they watched an NC-17 movie in a local cineplex.
They generally don't screen them anymore.

Summary: 
I knew it would be terrible.
I saw Showgirls in the theater.
I would have to excuse them all the time if I was on set.
