Original Response: 
It breaks my heart, but Molly needs a new home.
She is a terrier mix, about 50 lbs, and around 6 years old.
She is sweet and quiet and responds well to commands, honestly sometimes she's more like a cat than a dog.
She has always been well cared for, but we have a toddler who won't leave her alone, and curious toddlers and shy dogs don't mix.
I will provide vet records, an up to date set of vaccinations, and a years worth of heart worm prevention to start her off in a new home.
If anyone knows of a good family for Molly, please PM me.
Thanks.
I'm sorry you have to rehome her.
I'm sure that's extremely difficult, you can tell she's well loved.
Is she okay with other dogs?
Does she shed?
She was devoted to my beagle when he was alive, so she should be fine with other dogs.
Yes, she sheds.
Go to a rave and you'll find lots of people that want to take Molly.
