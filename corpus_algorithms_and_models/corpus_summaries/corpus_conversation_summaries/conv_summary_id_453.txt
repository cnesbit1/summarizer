I noticed the local B/S/T group on Facebook has a lot of people who are all of the sudden in the brush removal business.
All credit to hard workers out there making an honest dollar, but this also serves as a reminder that after a natural disaster, scammers will come crawling out from under their rocks.If you need home repairs, hire a licensed contractor; they won't have any problem showing you their license and giving you an estimate in writing.If the company you're thinking about hiring went into business this weekend, you should be skeptical.Above all, if it feels like a scam, it probably is!If you have elderly family members who need home repairs, PLEASE look out for them, as they are the prime target of scammers.And if you have questions or scam reports, the folks at /r/Scams  are there for you.
Same goes for those looking to help out Harvey victims.
[Learn from Katrina](http://www.nola.com/katrina/index.ssf/2015/08/katrina_brought_good_and_evil.html) and be smart when looking for help or when trying to donate help!
Texas doesn't licence contractors, but reputable ones will be insured.
I could be wrong and maybe over-generalizing, but aren't specialty contractors such as electricians and plumbers licensed, whereas general construction, such as roofers, not?Also, in addition to being insured, don't most reputable contractors offer some kind of warranty?
So true.
The bogus charities will be out in full force.
[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) gives detailed info on non-profit charities so you can see where the money goes.They even have a [page specifically devoted to Hurricane Harvey](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=5239#at_pco=smlwn-1.0&amp;at_si=59a4a7472d1f1e3f&amp;at_ab=per-2&amp;at_pos=0&amp;at_tot=1).
