thanks!

I'm all set bud hehe.
Although that mad mod is super nice and simple.
By the way looking through the pics of it and your Asmodus C4 review, my green one came with a different drip tip than you got.
If you check Fasttech /products/3041/10053499/9655414 , that's the tip I got and I really like it.
the brownish one?
that does look pretty cool.
still not sure why they didn't just go green though lol.
I think they originally came with the kind of mixed color one like I got, it has a lot of colors and even some clear parts.
It's kind of like they threw in a bunch of resin scraps.
Now they have that kind of snake pattern single color one like you got that matches most of them, but oddly the green one doesn't come with a green tip.
Blue comes with blue and red comes with red so don't know what is up with green.
yeah not sure as well.
that's also possible too since i got mine at ECC where they tend to have new stock of stuff to show off and sell.
I remember for sure when it was just announced , all the pics had the drip tip I got for every color and people commented a lot on it as it's somewhat unique, vs the fairly generic one offered now.
Glad I guess vapor dna had some older stock.
yeah that makes sense for sure.
standard tip on all, people complain and they replace it with matching tips :)
And then just say screw green!
lol.
=)
pretty much lol.
like we don't have green what do you want to do?
IDK throw a blue one in.
close enough.
Blue, green, same thing.
Why just the other day I went outside and the sky was green, no big deal.
Otherwise though it really is a phenomenal RDA.
yeah i think the grass was blue too LMAO but yeah i got other tips that match so no big deal and the RDA itself is excellent for sure.

Summary: 
like we don't have green what do you want to do?
yeah not sure as well.
IDK throw a blue one in.
yeah that makes sense for sure.
And then just say screw green!
that does look pretty cool.
