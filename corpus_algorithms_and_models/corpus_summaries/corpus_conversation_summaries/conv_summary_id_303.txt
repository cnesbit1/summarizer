Original Response: 
Wondering where the best locations to find a game are.
25 years old looking for the same age athletic type crowd.
Recommendations for specific beaches, bars, or others places where I would be able to join in would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, I'll check it out.
Used to vb at sonic on staples past saratoga.
Sonic on Staples and Mcardle, and Staples and Saratoga, and Dewey's Beer Garden.
Uhh have you tried playing beach volleyball on the beach??
You live in corpus.. set up a net and watch people show up to join you.
Did you just want to talk about volleyball??
I'm confused.
Being that I'm new to town I'm not exactly sure which beach locations cater to specific types of crowds (if I go to a family beach it's not really going to bring the same type of crowd as a party beach would).
Also the fact that internet searches don't really come up with any adult beach volleyball leagues suggests to me that there isn't a huge volleyball scene here.
South of the Packery channel is the beach you want to visit.
The beach that the Holiday Inn sits on.
But don't be afraid to go to any of the beaches and find a gang of people willing to play some volleyball.. just do it.
And Deweys' mostly plays dodgeball but the sand pit is set up for volleyball.
