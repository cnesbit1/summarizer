*Almost 14 million tourists visited Singapore in 2017, helping the  country retain its position as the fifth most visited global destination  out of 162 cities, and the second most visited in Asia-Pacific behind  Bangkok - based on the latest Mastercard Global Destination Cities Index  released on Tuesday (Sept 25).

*Singapore also topped the table in tourist spending for the  Asia-Pacific region, and was fourth globally for the second year in a  row.
Visitors spent an average of US$286 (S$390) a day here, resulting  in a total of US$17.02 billion spent in 2017.
