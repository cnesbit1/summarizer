Did this have some intentional reason behind it, or does he just not own a car?
If there's a reason, then it's fine.
If he just doesn't own a car, then it's bye boy.
I live in the burbs; you *need* a car here.
Ubering everywhere is just a huge waste of money.
Edit: who downvotes common sense??
?
Why don't you use your own car for the dates?
That's fine and I most certainly have in the past, but that doesn't mean I'm interested in a guy without a car.
Downvoters must live in places with decent public transit.
In smaller cities, especially in the western regions, not having a car is a huge problem.
Downvoters are self reliant.
Great,  but that's not related to her comment.
It's related to yours.
No it's not.
I have my own car as well.
It's a necessity in places without relibale public transit.
It depends on where you live.
You said that in your response....
If you can't see beyond life in the 'burbs, that's probably why people downvote you.
Ok....
But the burbs is where I live.
Thus my answer is tied to that.
Yes I'm aware people also live in the Middle East.
That's not going to affect my answers on dating in my US suburb.

Summary: 
I have my own car as well.
It depends on where you live.
But the burbs is where I live.
