&gt;Hmmm so around 49% on canadian like him 

Where are you getting that from?
They must have meant "9.2%" which also seems high.
Math skills of a trump supporter, ladies and gentlemen.
Your point sir ?
My point is that youâ€™re exactly as intelligent as I would expect someone who supports trump to be.
Please.
Tell us where you got 49% from.
Worse : 15.5%
Very worst : 34.5% 

Add those numbers, you get around 50%, so the other 50% are people that actually don't mind Donald Trump !
But like i said, there's bias in this survey !
I know, right?
Trump is an amazing leader &amp; has single handly changed the US economics to the greatest economics in America!
It was already the greatest in America, but he is working for his people (unless our dumb clown here : Justin trudeau) !
!
So i love the Trump since here we have a incompetent, dumb and artistic PM that don't care about canadian (that are born canadian) !

Well neutral people "like trump" in the sense that they dont think it's worse !

Thats the whole point !

Also, what was the original question for this survey ?
Anyway just checked (Inboundreport) ?
!
What a bullcrap.

Actually, words have a predefined meaning and don't just twist around to support statements after the fact, humpty dumpty.
The people who said 'better' numbered just 18.1%.
Those neutral could just as easily be added to the dislike column 'in that they don't expressly think it's better'.
A real trump supporter will never support criminal immigrations!
Ahahahahaha.
