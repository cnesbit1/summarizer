Original Response: 
No joke, just 3 days ago I planned my annual Corpus trip.
I'm coming in a few days.
Please advise.
Mustang Island it self was closed as of today.
We drove down JP Luby this afternoon which was open.
Places on North Padre Island will slowly begin to open back up.
Places further North, Port Aransas etc., will likely be closed for some time.
The storm damage is immense in that area.
(Mustang Island State Park, that is.)
I would advise you to reschedule or head down to south padre island.
Corpus isn't really going to be ready for tourist visits this weekend.
Sorry to hear.
Are there any usable beaches just south of Flour Bluff then?
I just want to hit the beach with my new GF.
SPI is a bit further and more expensive.
is your car solar powered?
No joke?
Come on down.
Waste your time.Idiot.
The city is still telling residents of corpus who evacuated to not come back yet.That should be enough of a clue that you shouldn't be heading down just to hit the beaches.
Seriously, don't go down, it's not time for tourists and vacationers.

Summary:
