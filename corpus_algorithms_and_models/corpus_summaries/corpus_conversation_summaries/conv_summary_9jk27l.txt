Original Response: 
Religion is on their death throes.
Christianity included.
Major religion will never die, even in Singapore's secularism.
Singaporeans must simply move towards being more tolerant and understanding towards different religions and non-believers.
nah, they will.
they have no relevance left in the modern world.
ah, please.
*organized* religion will always exist as long as there are disenfranchised and/or power-hungry people who need to spin a simple and seductive polemical narrative about how they’re always Doing The Right Thing.
yes, the poor and crazy.
just leave them to their devices and they’ll self destruct.
once upon a time, there was a need for them to do shit jobs, but with further improvements in automation and AI we don’t need them anymore.
There will always be people who believe that what they are doing is right.
Religion does not have a monopoly on these people, you got people like Antifa and the Nazi.
As long as they can justify to themselves that whatever they are doing is right, they can become capable of committing horrendous atrocities.

Fountain pens have no relevance now but it is still surviving

Religions will never be gone.
You do realise that the % of religious people is rising globally and the % of atheists is on a downwards trend?
In fact Christianity is the second fastest growing religious group, after Islam.

I know Reddit is largely secular, but making wild conclusions from an echo chamber is about as valid as standing in a KFC and saying "vegetarianism is in its death throes".
That is global or regional data.
[wikipedia has an article here that shows singapore's religious trends from the last 30 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Singapore) and it seems like there is a rising number of people who identify as "non-religious".
Catholicism is on a fall while Protestantism is on a slow rise; taken together, christianity is still on the rising trend but the trend is slowly dying out.
islam on the other hand is also falling in numbers.
This statement is so off-topic but I just want to say I love fountain pens as well lol.
Penbbs stuff is the shit.
corroborates my stand.
more disenfranchised people turning to religion because modern day society has no need for them anymore.
having more people on your side counts for very little nowadays.
there is about 7 times more people in asia than in the US but does that count for anything?
even in the US, they voted trump in but did it have any effect on those in power?
lol.
You:

&gt; taken together, christianity is still on the rising trend

Who does calligraphy anymore nowadays, it is all about 3D printing!
I know that was disingenuous but it's a lot easier to get your hands on a fountain pen than a 3D printer haha.
Also, this is such an r/fountainpens circlejerk but there's more to fountain pens than calligraphy.
Both statements can be true though.
Islam, Christianity and the non-religious segment have experienced a small rise while Buddhism/taoism proportion has dropped quite a bit iirc according to a census a few years back.
With all the priest rapes being uncovered recently I'm surprised Christians still have the audacity to claim the moral high ground.
Strange meh?
It's well known that Christians are gold medalists in mental gymnastics.
Yeah, because the actions of a few speaks for all of them right?
The day people truly understand this we can actually start discussing real issues.
If your club management harbors rapists for **decades**, it's a bit hard for anyone outside looking in to see anything else except a club of child molesters and enablers of child molesters.
[deleted]
Don't see the Christian coming out in mass condemning the child rape

If the Christian do it as loud as what they are currently doing on 377A, then they are not hypocrites.
I agree, not all Christians have the audacity to claim the moral high ground /s.
For me, it’s more of - before you want to criticise others outside of your faith, clean up your own house first.
Christianity has many denominations, the most prominent being Catholics and Protestants.
Catholics are the pedo ones 

Protestants don't like Catholics.
Most Christians in Singapore are Protestant.
To play devil’s advocate, the instances of priest sexual misconduct within the Catholic Church are not a domestic issue; 377A is.
Suffice to say, I don’t need to explain how apathy is a spectrum.
Oh ya there's that.
Are Evangelicals the same as protestants though?
That isn't even an appropriate analogy.
If someone *tries* to repeal a law prohibiting child rape, you can bet the Christians will come out and condemn it.
Wow way to continue the divide...


Protestants have their fair share of child molesters/rapists.
The difference is that the Catholic church are more organized to move people around.
Currently what is out in the news has to do mostly with priests who have committed the crimes many years ago (some are already dead actually).
Of course, is this saying there's no issue?
Obviously not, the Church needs to address the world at the very least on what has happened.
Christianity is mainly divided into 3 different big denominations.
There's the Catholics, the Orthodox (not a very big thing in SG, but more Russia/Greek), and the Protestants.
The Protestants are themselves divided into even more denominations, such as Baptists, Lutherans, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, Methodists, Anglicans, non-denominational, etcetc.
Each of these smaller denominations have several small to big differences with each other, but are mainly grouped under Protestants, as their main characteristic (from history) is protesting the Catholic church.
Where' there's smoke, there's usually a fire.
People of all creeds and faiths have their fair share of child molesters.
While it is obvious that the Catholic Church has to address the misdeeds prevalent in their organization, I don't think it's fair to lump all Christians with Catholics.
After all, Protestants are way less organised and have different beliefs.
TIL all Christians are Catholics.
Well this is pretty much the "Oh wow Kong Hee embezzled money, all Christians are money grubbing whores", just changed over to the Catholic side.
While obviously each denomination has it fair share of good and bad, it is not exactly fair to lump all Protestants together as "don't like Catholics".
It's also not exactly fair to lump all Catholics as "the pedo ones".
While most people will say the bad things done by a few do not reflect on the rest, it is just a fallacy to say "oh look they have done so much worse, I'm innocent".
Nuance is always important in any issue.
Heck, I agree with you.
Nuance is always important.
I guess my comment was wrong.
It is blatant that every creeds, religion, political group etc have their faults.
In such times I think it's really important to have conversation so that we can understand the arguments from all sides.

Pretty much any major splinter has a history of diddling little children, and then trying to cover it up.
The Catholic Church is just the biggest and most identifiable.
They all share the same DNA though, which is reverence of an authority figure who has no checks on power, willingness to put children into his care because the parent's guard is down, unwillingness to challenge this authority figure for fear of losing one's place in the community and unwillingness by superiors to punish offenders in order to maintain the illusion of the group's holiness.
Once you let someone do your thinking for you because it feels good, you better hope that person is a saint, and everyone in the chain of authority is a saint as well.
If you not Christian you go to hell!
No need gymnastics

God loves everyone but if you reject him you go to hell.
Its not his fault you too stupid to simply accept him.
He loves every one

/s.
Is it just me or are the LGBT flooding freaking Reddit SG with 377A articles.
congratulations you are *exactly the fucking problem as illustrated*
I am in the freaking repeal 377A camp.
I just find spamming of these types of stupid articles really annoying and does nothing for their cause.
As if posting it will do any good.
If anything it is pissing pple like me off enough to jump to the other side.
And I'm the type of middle ground pple the freaking LGBT needs to attract.
Imagine being the type of person who has their opinion on human rights issue swayed because *people are actively discussing the issue* (or in their minds, "spamming").
I don't think it's spam if it's a different article each thread?
You're in the repeal 377a camp, but you're also the middle ground?
Imagine seeing spam post of annoying topic U don't care about appearing again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again

Yes it puts pple off.
Vast majority of pple taking part in the discussion of such topics are already in their respective camps and will stick with it no matter what

Meanwhile middle ground neutrals like me who couldn't care less sees their favorite page keeps getting spam day after day after day after day with stupid articles of the same stupid topic they don't care about

That's how U get a backlash from pple like me.
Congratulations U just help the Retain 377A camp.
If U got something groundbreaking, by all means share it.
Nope, just stupid opinions of SJWs.
&gt; s spam if it's a different article each thread?
&gt; 
&gt; You're in the repeal 377a camp, but you're also the middle groun

It's the same freaking thing in a different skin.
What are the other posts you'll like to see?
The many sunset/sunrise photos, complaints about MRT, complaints/questions about NS, this is my first visit to Singapore what should I do posts?
I have no problem if its 377A related as long as it's not the same freaking shit all the freaking time

Example of different shit here
https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9jjoof/raymond_ng_made_police_report_because_someone/

Not some stupid ass opinion of how I think 377A should be repeal flooding the freaking page.
It's really annoying.
I see maybe 1 stupid sunset photo a day, max.
I see 5 freaking 377A related post on page 1 alone right now.
It's doing nothing for LGBT other than piss off middle ground pple lik me.
I guess you havent been to facebook recently as it is flooded with christians who are even more vocal about the non-repeal of 377a.
You don't like then don't read, jesus christ.
GTFO.
&gt; you


&gt; middle ground

fucking rofl.
He's in the repeal 377a camp, but only if it's convenient for him.
Don't let him see the gays, doesn't want to know about the gays, doesn't want to know any gays and i'm using gay as an umbrella term for homosexuals or any of the lgbtq+ community.
People want to have an open discussion he's like GET OUT GET OUT TOO MUCH FOR ME NOPE NOPE.
'Pple' like you should just downvote this post and move on.
Sorry if articles that turn on up r/sg aren't to your taste.
And if you have the idea that people will stick to their camps no matter what, why bother adding to the discussion?
If the LGBT like to continue in their freaking echo chamber and ignore the advise from the very pple they need to attract.
By all means continue spamming.
Take the fight to facebook, stop spamming reddit.
the community here are already predominantly anti-377A.
OK, then what's your advice on attracting more support to repeal 377a then?
Or how about pple like me who actually plan to support 377A try not to downvote the stupid post and give advise to LGBT on how NOT to piss off the middle ground.
Listening to the freaking echo chamber is why the opposition in SG cant figure out why they keep losing.
Not spamming the freaking page with stupid articles that are the same freaking thing for a start, Reddit SG is already mostly Anti-377A

U don't need to spam the same freaking opinions to pple who already share your freaking opinion.
U go do it to pple who don't

I am not saying to stop posting anti 377A articles.
What I am saying is stop pissing off pple with Spam of useless opinion.
Post quality articles or things that are different e.g.
stupid shit like the idiot who made a police report.
Creating spam topics where let's face it only pple who are already supporting the cause are going to reply anyway doesn't move the cause forward.
It only creates an echo chamber

For the rest of us sitting on the fence, it has the opposite effect because spam is annoying.
I can't think of anyone who doesn't think spam is annoying.
And guess what pple do when they are annoyed.
Stop trying to hold people hostage to your opinion.
I don't see how you can have any worthwhile advice to anyone in the repeal camp when you just said you don't believe people can be swayed.
I don't know about you, but when I see multiple fan art posts on subreddits for various games (which I find annoying), it doesn't piss me off to the point that I'm turned off by the games.
Pple who read these topics and reply to these topics already share the same freaking opinion that 377A should be repeal.
U are doing nothing other than creating a freaking echo chamber.
U're not getting more pple to support your cause

While for the rest of us who are not freaking SJWs get annoyed by because we see it as freaking spam.
Good luck attracting pple to your cause by annoying us with spam messages.
I don't think the majority of the people think that posting various and different articles about the subject as being spam.
Also, I don't think it happens daily.
Rather than saying what people shouldn't do, do you have any suggestions on what they could do?
Would you like to see a mega discussion thread that's stickied on this subject?
Are there even enough threads being posted to warrant a mega discussion thread?
&gt; page with stupid articles that are the same freaking thing for a start, Reddit SG is already mostly Anti-377A
&gt; 
&gt; U don't need to spam the same freaking opinions to pple who already share your freaking opinion.
U go do it to pple who don't
&gt; 
&gt; I am not saying to stop posting anti 

I see 6 topics right now of the same related to freaking 377A on the 1st page of SG Reddit and 5 of them are nothing more than the same freaking why do I support 377A opinions.
Yes it's spam.
He can't come up with suggestions and feels like he just wants to say repeal 377a so he can feel good and get a pat on the back.
Ok, you're entitled to your opinion.
There's the report spam button, you're welcome to use it?
People sharing a similar opinion does not make something an echo chamber.
There are plenty of people who oppose the idea that 377A should be repealed on r/sg, that's precisely why such heated debate is happening.
There's quite a clearly written article on what an echo chamber actually is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_\(media\)) if you're interested.
**Echo chamber (media)**

In news media, echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system.
By visiting an "echo chamber", people are able to seek out information which reinforces their existing views, potentially as an unconscious exercise of confirmation bias.
This may increase political and social polarization and extremism.
The term is a metaphor based on the acoustic echo chamber, where sounds reverberate in a hollow enclosure.

What?
Your comment is the epitome of someone who is not in the middle ground.
If discussing the problem is able to sway your opinion on whether 377A should be repealed then I think you should not be in this subreddit.
This subreddit discusses all things concerning Singapore, problems included.
&gt;And I'm the type of middle ground pple the freaking LGBT needs to attract

What is this supposed to mean?
That we are somehow at the mercy of your whims?
I do not want to ask why you think 377A should be repealed for fear that you may start babbling incoherently.
By plenty of pple U referring to the non-existent negative comments about repealing 377A.
I can't find any.
I don't even see any topics to retain 377A right now after scrolling through 3 pages of r/sg but I saw at least 10 articles of same freaking opinions of "why I support the repeal of 377A" 
U probably forgot to take your medication today.
IKR, wow he agrees for repeal 377a, now we gotta name him our lord and saviour for being....MIDDLE GROUND.

Ah, you sound just like my husband.
I'll tell you what I told him; just scroll on.
I'm sick and tired of hearing about Trump, but the world doesn't owe me anything, so it's up to me to choose what I read.
So if you're sick about this topic, then go find something else to read lah.
&gt;In news media, echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system.
That's pretty much this sub; coming here to reinforce their opinion that 377A should be repealed, or bitching about NS, or the AMDK memes.
It's a phenomenon observed in most subreddits anyway.
What's odd is that he started off proclaiming that he was for repeal then acted the opposite and closed his comment claiming that he is "middle ground".
So okay, you want people to share it if it's groundbreaking.
Follow up: How do you define "groundbreaking"?
And it seems like your mind is already made up as to any topic on 377A is "spamming".
So you would likely not see any "groundbreaking" opinion on this?
&amp;#x200B;

And back to my first point, you literally just personified the person imagined in my previous post on being so selfish and ignorant to have an opinion changed on something that affects heaps of people because you don't like seeing or hearing people talk about it.
Are these posts made by LGBTs or just concerned redditors or redditors looking to get karma?
🤔.
Meh, imo there's nothing neutral about being middle ground on the topics such as human rights.
r/enlightenedcentrism.
True very true.
And people who are anti repeal get dow voted like this single comment thread.
Karma farming.

Summary: 
I am in the freaking repeal 377A camp.
Heck, I agree with you.
I don't think it's spam if it's a different article each thread?
