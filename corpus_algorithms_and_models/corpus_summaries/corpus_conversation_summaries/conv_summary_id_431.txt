Anyone know of any trails or areas to ride?
I used to bike [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/27%C2%B039'59.4%22N+97%C2%B019'29.5%22W/@27.666492,-97.3270497,1044m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d27.666492!4d-97.324861) area back in high school (mountain bike), the way the sandy soil erodes creates some nice little hills and theres a good amount of land to explore around.
I'm not sure if they have any rules about motor vehicles but if theres no sign I doubt it'll be a problem.I'm not very familiar with dirt bikes or how well they would work in sand, but [this](https://www.google.com/maps/place/27%C2%B032'43.7%22N+97%C2%B014'24.2%22W/@27.545473,-97.2410238,469m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d27.545473!4d-97.240041) area just south of bob hall pier looks perfect.
Uh, no.
The area you reference at east end of Holly is a combination of private property and city park.
And a lot of the land has been or is being developed.
Folks that can afford the homes built there don't like outsiders using their neighborhood as a playground.
Are you one of those people?
Heavens no!
I couldn't care less.
Nor could I come close to afford.
Just a lil precautionary suggestion.
