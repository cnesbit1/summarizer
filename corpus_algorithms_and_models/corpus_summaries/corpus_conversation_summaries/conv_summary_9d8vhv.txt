Original Response: 
I am F 25, my SO is M 27.
I have a way higher sex drive than he does, and I get frustrated when he doesn’t want sex when I do.
I know that isn’t fair, so last night when I wanted to initiate, and he said no I wanted to just have some me time to take care of my own needs.
The problem is we live in a 1 bedroom apartment and we were both in bed, so I didn’t have anywhere to go and take care of my needs.
I don’t want to just whip out my vibrator in front of him when he says no, but I’m not sure how to get away to satisfy my self.
I tried saying I was going to go watch a show on the couch, and he lovingly replied with, you can just watch it here next to me, it won’t bother me.
I do want some privacy, but I’m not sure how to sneak away in those situations.
Also, we pretty much go to bed at the same time every day, so it’s hard to go to bed before he does to meet my needs.
Any advice?

&gt; is usually just because 1 partner isn’t finding the other that hot

I'm calling 100% bs on this one.
Different people have different sex drives, and even things like stress can cause someone's sex drive to vary.
Immediately assuming they don't want to have sex with you because they don't find you attractive will kill a relationship.
Holy fuck no.
Good lord.
We hit backhanded comment on her looks, we hit woman's responsibility for a mans actions, and even managed a "no REAL man would ever not want to have sex!"
and you did it all under the guise of offering helpful advice!
Go have a nice long think about not perpetuating this kind of bullshit and why you are ok with it in the first place.
It says a whole lot about you and not good things.

Holy fuck this is some backwards 1950s misogynistic ass talking.
Different sex drives are 100% a thing.
Quit blaming OP.
Sweet Jesus, I always forget people actually think this way.
It's not true.
Different sex drives exist, regardless of the person's attractiveness.

Definitely not the case.
I don’t know what your use of “usually” could be based upon other than you either referring to yourself or guessing wildly.
They could have different sex drives for any number of reasons.
It’s also not unheard of that after being with someone for a period of time the novelty can wear off.
This does in no way imply that she should feel the need to “keep in shape” or “make an effort to dress up”.
There are far better ways of being enticing.
Having a talk about what makes the other person tick is most likely to lead to a solution.
I’m sure a whole lot of people have some kink or other that they feel ashamed talking about, which could turn the routine of having sex for the sake of having sex into something to look forward to.

You're saying that the only explanation for different sex drives is that OP isn't attractive enough.
It's insulting, inane, and patently false.
I'm led believe your have never been in any kind of committed sexual relationship.
Pretty sure anyone with actually knowledge on these things would say otherwise.
"I am a sexist pig and know of others who are also sexist pigs" =/= truth.
Your ideas are harmful.
To everyone.
Other people sharing said ideas is not even a remotely valid excuse for refusing to confront that.

I mean you're spewing a virgins idea of a sexual relationship so...
How you can think asking if they're in shape is not insulting boggles my mind and makes me sorry for your partner.
