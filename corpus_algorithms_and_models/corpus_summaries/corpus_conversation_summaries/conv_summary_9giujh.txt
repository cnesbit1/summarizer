No really.
Even though I have very little in common with Bernier's political values, he is representing some very distinct viewpoints that are perfectly valid and, previously hadn't been meaningfully represented on the political stage.
Having prominent, distinct choices is an important part of democracy, and keeps us from falling into the deeply entrenched "douche or turd sandwich" two-party philosophy we see from our neighbours down south.
It's bullshit.
It's to fool gullible idiots.
Alex Jones calls himself a classical liberal too.
I get what you're saying, but Alex Jones is a literal crazy person, so it's a bit hyperbolic to compare Bernier to him.
If Bernier's spinning a yarn, at least it's a believable one.
We'll have to wait and see if Bernier is really selling what he's pitching, but if he's being genuine, it's a *good thing* for Canadian politics because it encourages growth and divergence rather than stagnation.
The other edge of the sword would be if Bernier's party is a resounding failure in the next election, or he is proven to be a con.
This would likely cause politicians or voters, respectively, to further rally around "the big 3" and continue to be wary of divergent parties.
Alex Jones has never called himself that, he attacks Classical Liberals with his BS.
Alex Jones for example has never called himself a 'Classical Liberal', he is full of shit and even atttacks classical liberals all the time on somehow trying to control the world.
To say he is one or says he is one  make my eyes rolls  and go LOL.
The Editor in Chief of Infowars Paul Joseph Watson Trump supporting,  far right in policy labels himself a "classical liberal".
Paul Ryan also calls himself a classical liberal.
I'm not comparing them both.
I am just pointing out the stupid nature of the word classical liberal.
Paul Ryan is a true believer and has nothing with Alex Jones, there are Classical Liberals in the GOP, but many dislike Trump and Paul Ryan is one of them.
I mean, just because it's commonly misappropriated doesn't mean it should never be used.
Ok.
So the mainstream right wing anti-government slash welfare privatize healthcare politics of Republican Party before Trump is classical liberalism?
The GOP believes in less government, it isn't 100% Classical Liberalism, more American conservatism.
Trump isn't Classical Liberal given his views on women, LGBT's and minorities.
True Classical Liberals believe in the rights of all persons.
Trump doesn't fall under this.
It's marketing because the word "liberal" sounds less threatening than "libertarian."
Look, I'm just like you!
There are ways to fix everything that aren't so extreme!
How is it stupid?
It's what "Liberal" used to mean a century ago or more until the modern left-wing Liberals appropriated the term and now it means the opposite on many positions.
So now the much-less-known Classical Liberals are forced to append another word to distinguish the meaning.
The Editor of Chief of Infowars calls himself a classical liberal.
 He is full of shit, if he thinks that.
He isn't.
Alex Jones never did.

Some do not even know what they are talking about when they attack us.
It is a good thing to see a party with a more back to basics, classical approach to policy.
Even if I don't vote for them, I'm glad he's there to express that viewpoint instead of being smothered under the "big tent" of a larger party.
It's **GIANT** douche, buddy.

It appears that it was I who was the douche all along.
