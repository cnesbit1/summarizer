I don’t understand the people telling you to just get over it and let her live her life.
This is a 37 year age difference.
This man was a GROWN ASS ADULT before your daughter was even in the womb.
It’s creepy.
He’s a predator.
Contact the school, anonymously if you have to.
It’s not illegal but it’s certainly against that school’s policy because she is a currently enrolled student.
Even if this doesn’t stop the relationship, at least let that man suffer the consequences of dating someone a literal third of his age.

I mean, he's not.
She's a grown woman lol.
At a 37 year age difference the older person is definitely a predator.
Just because someone is legally an adult doesn't mean they're emotionally mature.
Even "mature" 20yos don't have the life experience to relate to someone in their fucking 50s.
She can be an adult but he's still pretty much a predator.
To imply that a 20 year old is a fully developed adult with perfect decision making abilities is inconsistent with the reality of human development.
Barely a grown woman.
The age difference is still too overwhelming.
She is **not** a grown woman.
I'm not sure if predator is a fair term for the guy (it might be), but 20 is NOT fully grown.
What, you're telling me a year or two after leaving highschool you've experienced enough of life to be considered mature?
What the fuck?
Why do people act like 18 magically equals adult?
Because a piece of paper says so?
You obviously do a ton of your growing in your 20's, especially growing that relates to being an adult and adult decisions.
And as far as I'm aware the human brain doesn't stop developing physically until 25-26 or even later..?
Ugh.
People like you make me sick.
Just following a number without actually thinking about it.
You're either too young to know 20 isn't fully grown, or too stupid to acknowledge it.
Exactly how can anyone just say get over it?
This professor she’s dating is older than the father.
She has to know that she’s hurting her father and doesn’t seem to care.

I mean, *legally* yes but have you met a 20 year old?
&gt;  This man was a GROWN ASS ADULT before your daughter was even in the womb

And how is that relevant to today?
That was 20 years ago.
Today, she's an adult and he's an adult.
They're making adult decisions.
He's still dad, but that doesn't give him authority to decide his daughter's relationships for her.
There's certainly reason to be cautious and suspect something may be wrong here, but there's 0 reason whatsoever why something *must* be wrong here.
Trying to forcefully control an adult daughter's relationship by having her boyfriend's job threatened sounds like a good way to cripple his relationship with the daughter.
His best move is, indeed, to basically get over it.
Let it play out, whatever IT is, and continue to be in a position to provide useful *guidance* to the daughter.

Because antagonizing this relationship will just damage his relationship with his daughter and maybe that's not the wisest course of action.
Maybe letting her figure out on her own that this is a bad idea and being there for her when that happens will end better.
&gt;Contact the school, anonymously if you have to.
The daughter will put 2 and 2 together and know who told them.

That's a stupid cop out and you know it.
The guy would have to be mentally disabled to be on the same maturity level as a 20yo at 57 and given that he's a professor he's obviously not.
Today, she's 20 years old and he is 57 years old.
That's why it matters.

You realize that 'predator' doesn't just mean, 'someone above legal age who preys on someone below legal age' right?
Like, do you think that's what lions do?
[removed]
True, but also ...
So what?
He's not making her leave the country with him.
They're just in a relationship and being in a relationship with someone for a while is not some kind of critical decision that will haunt her for the rest of her life.
She's attracted to him, obviously, and they're having sex, going out for dinner, stuff like that.
I think, being in a relationship with whomever she wants is a decision she can make at that age, even if she isn't fully developed.
You might question his decision to be with her and that's fine, but if he isn't pressuring or manipulating her, I think it's perfectly fine for him to sleep with someone he's attracted to, even if they're aren't as experienced or worldly as him.
Cut the umbilical cord, if it was a 33 year old dating a 60 year old nobody would advocate stepping in and interfering with it.
You're well within your right to think it is gross but we baby people for far too long, at some point all you can do is talk to somebody about what they're doing and give them advice, but if they want to make a mistake like that then they can, they're an adult.
You can drive a car at 16, you can join the military  at 18, but you should not be able to fuck who you want?
Hell, we generalize about what a relationship between a much older person a d a younger person is, we generalize it as being manipulative and predatorial but she could benefit from the relationship for all we know because we dont know what kind of person she is or what kind of person he is.

Why should she if she sees nothing wrong with her relationship?
Should gay kids care that their parents are hurt by them dating a person of the same sex?
This isn’t about homophobia or racism or any such of those bigotry.
It’s about safety.
It’s about keeping your daughter away from a pervert who preys on barely legal women.
But you can't keep her away, that's the point.
You will keep her away from *you* as a parent if you act all ragey and "I know what's best for you" about it, though.
I wouldn't care if my relationship hurt my parents.
It's my relationship, they get no say.
They are not equals in that relationship.
So many of your comments are along the lines of she's legal now, it's all good.
Nothing disgusting there.
You say that until you become a parent and then you see your son dating someone 35 years older than him lol.
Who said anything about being ragey?
You can communicate how it’s hurting to know that your daughter is dating a predator without flipping shit.
I would cut the term predator but other than that I agree.

What's ironic is if it was a 20 year old son in a gay relationship with a 57 year old man then most people on this sub would be defending it...
Well, I mean, yeah - she's legal now, it's all good unless it's not.
Nothing in the OP indicates it's not all good except for his own discomfort.
And he's not wrong to feel uncomfortable about all that.
If she's in the US she can't even legally drink yet.
You really don't see anything wrong in the slightest with this?
Nothing?

I mean sure they get no say but isn't it a little heartless to just expect them to be on board with their daughter dating someone who could be their age?
That's putting them in between a rock and a hard place.
Do I act like it's fine when I hate this or tell her I don't like this and I don't want her bringing him around me?

It really is that simple.
Either you treat someone with enough respect that they can make their own choices or you don't.
It's weird and different and maybe you wouldn't make that decision but then it's not you in the situation.
What you are advocating and talking will only serve to push her away from her dad.
And there's a difference to disagreeing with someone's choices and judging them for it.
I don't smoke but plenty of friends do.
I help them when they want to quit but I don't treat them like shit for it.

I'm 34 and still feel the same as when I was 17 or maybe even 16, what's your point?
She's literally NOT still a kid, and will never figuratively be an adult unless she's allowed to make her own decisions.
16 (and in some states 17 or 18) is the *legal* point at which those decisions are allowed to be made because we *have* to have an agreed upon demarcation point *somewhere*.
Ideally, people should always make such decisions with input from more experienced people whom one trusts (e.g.
parents such as OP), but she's old enough to create her own experiences regardless whether her parents or anyone else approves.
Our brains being fully developed does not magically grant us experience, and experience can go a long way on a brain that's not fully ripe.
By your logic no one should be having sex until they're around 25 and their brains are fully developed.

Well then you need to GROW THE FUCK UP.
Seriously, if you actually don't feel like you've matured, gain knowledge or wisdom or emotional strength in almost 20 years, that should be very unsettling to you.

Plenty of older people with younger people in the celebrity world or even mildly famous or not even but nobody bats an eye.
That's because people consider Hollywood to basically be another planet where having 5 marriages is normal.
I would not be pissed.
I'd be wary, and certainly more than a little confused.
I'd have a few things to talk about with her for sure, but that's my overarching advice to this guy: maintain that relationship with his daughter.
Don't fuck it up by trying to meddle in her affairs.
He can, and should, express his concerns and discomfort.
She can, and should, hear him out completely and consider his feelings.
But if she wants to date the guy for whatever reason, it's her decision - that conversation simply adds factors for her consideration in that decision.
And I do feel the same as 16, don't try to invalidate my experiences.
I felt I knew a lot then, I feel pretty much the same now.
How much I do *actually* know has, arguably, increased hopefully.
So on a serious note, I know exactly what point you're making, I'm not playing stupid.
I simply disagree on how much it matters.
If you don't feel that way - what do you know anyway, you're only 18 and I have far more experience, right?
Clearly you can see that age and supposed experience does not inherently decide superiority.
&gt;Im not saying she cant be with whoever she wants  
&gt;  
&gt;this would be totally okay if the guy was like 30.
But this man is 57

I'll just leave that there.
&gt;If she was going to marry someone dated for one week, or having a child after a one night stand, would you shrug and say "we'll, she's an adult, she knows what she wants and I'm sure she's calculated all the consequences of her choice" or would you warn her that she's making a risky decision?
I'd warn her that I think it's risky.
Which is what I think this dad should do.
And I think she should consider his advice.
But if she still wants the relationship, then there's nothing wrong with it.
Relationships are not science, no one really knows anything, ever.
We gain experience, we form opinions, we take stabs in the dark and hope for the best.
There's no moral authority that gives an absolute answer as to what's right and what's not.
That's up to the participants, morally, and up to society to decide the legal points at which they can make such decisions.
Honestly if I knew the 60 year old I'd be giving the same advice.
It's risky, it's stupid, what could you possibly see in them, etc.
But just like with the 20 year old, if that's the decision a consenting adult has made with another consenting adult then it IS ok.  That's simply all there is to it for me.
I wouldn't be happy, but I wouldn't ruin my own relationship with my daughter because of a decision she's made - what's the logic in that?
Is that what I said?
The point is, I'm not that young any more, and the OC is 18, not 16.
They *are* a legal adult now whether they like it or not, whether they feel ready or not.
I know their point is that they *don't* feel ready, but that doesn't matter, *they are still an adult.
*  Just like this 20 year old woman is an adult.
She can make her own decisions.
Will she know who she is as well as this 60 year old knows who he is?
Hopefully not, but after this relationship has run its course she'll be a step closer to knowing who she is.
Denying her an experience she's chosen to engage in simply isn't helpful, unless there's something actually dangerous about that experience.
Him being 57 is a reason to be cautious, it's *not* inherently dangerous.

Summary: 
She can make her own decisions.
I would not be pissed.
Is that what I said?
She is **not** a grown woman.
That was 20 years ago.
Today, she's an adult and he's an adult.
People like you make me sick.
Which is what I think this dad should do.
It's my relationship, they get no say.
And I think she should consider his advice.

I mean, he's not.
She can be an adult but he's still pretty much a predator.
