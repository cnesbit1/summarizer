I've noticed before that the bottom edge of some escalators are secured by duct tape.
Not saying it's the cause of this dislodge but I've always wondered why in the world is duct tape being used.
Quick fix.
Ikr, should have use flex tape /s.
Obviously since SMRT is run by ex SAF chiefs, the clear solution is to use black tape to fix everything.
Hi, Phil Swift here with Flex Tape!
The super-strong waterproof tape!
That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair!
Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks.
Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly!
Plus, Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater!
Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them!
Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs!
Flex Tape is super strong, and once it's on, it holds on tight!
And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions!
Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes.
To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half!
And repaired it with only Flex Tape!
Not only does Flex Tape’s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry!
Yee-doggy!
Just cut, peel, stick and seal!
Imagine everything you can do with the power of Flex Tape!
should have used gorilla tape!
I thought it was something out of inter dimensional cable from Rick and Morty till I googled it.
I hope its gorilla tape and not electric tape.
Damn cost cutting.
If Saw Phaik Hwa was still SMRT CEO, I bet they would use cable ties to secure it.
**I SAWED THIS BOAT IN HALF**

Summary: 
should have used gorilla tape!
And repaired it with only Flex Tape!
Ikr, should have use flex tape /s.
Imagine everything you can do with the power of Flex Tape!
