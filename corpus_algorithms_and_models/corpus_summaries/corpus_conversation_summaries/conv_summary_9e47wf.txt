Does anyone run full holo (sword / pistol)?
I don't see many out there doing it so I wasn't sure if it was really viable.
If so are you tanking up on stats?
And does the sword benefit from power?
There are builds for both sword and rifle.
Look for them on sites like metabattle, snowcrows, and discretize.
Aye I ran kitless sword holo.
Itâ€™s very viable and has an easy rotation compared to rifle kit holo at the cost of around 10% dps.
A good tradeoff for someone like me that has a hard time pulling tight rotation due to ping.
Offhand pistol can be changed to shield if you have trouble staying alive.
You also lose most of your cc.
I never gave much thought to off hand shield.
Does it make a noticeable difference?
Also with that setup do you run power?
I've been running Power Holo with Sword/Shield for a while now and it's been working great for me.
I tried pistol for a bit but you don't really improve your damage over shield and the CC from the shield is great, especially for solo or open-world content if you don't have teammates to CC along with you.
Thanks a lot, going to switch up to shield / sword combo tonight and see how it goes!
Have fun!
[Here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Toolbelt_Sword/Shield) is basically the build I've been using...
Great!
I was wondering if you had one.
I appreciate the help!
I run it.
Pretty nice when, for example, Amala phases when I'm overheating.

Summary: 
I was wondering if you had one.
Also with that setup do you run power?
There are builds for both sword and rifle.
