Ah.
This meme again.
BTC must be going up.
Time to check cmc.
seems its get used by smaller and smaller deviations though.
Yup.
5% swing?
Who gives a fuck.
At least 226 people at time of writing.

they sound like forex traders...
During the drop all we need to do is flip the pic upside down.
People upvote anything positive for Bitcoin here, whether it's valid or not.
...u must be new, here.
or you forgot the '/s' tag?
Yeah I think it's more pathetic than cute.
It is pathetic.
Life is pathetic.
Cutie!
We need a new GIF for _actual_ movement.
Like a bear dying GIF.
Or something.
This is kids roller coaster movement.
How awesome though if they are new and this is the first rise they've seen...
I'd be pretty pumped right now if I started investing spring of '18.
And you know what?
That's okay.

When last I checked, the price of bitcoin was 6694.99, but then I now it is 6695.00.
We going to the moon ya'll.
What we need is .. .
Do you remember Mr. Bill (SNL segment from 80's)?
Yeah, we need a Bitcoin is Dead meme like that; where it dies in a new, gruesome, cartoon-ish manner, everytime.
But the joke is, another Mr. Bill episode each week.
&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Ahh, Mr. Hand.
Margin traders.
Actually I tend to mostly up vote this whether it's this one or the down hill.
Rising means nothing if it falls right back down.
How about these?
For when the time is right.

Not when it's misleading/misinforming... it's really not okay at all.
Depends on your trade strategy.
For a HODLer, that makes sense but for swing traders or people trading on the RSI, gains like these are great.
Mr.
BILL!!
oh nooooooooooo!
Haha my dog had a squeaky toy of Mr Bill that said that when it got bit.
It was awesome at Thanksgiving randomly going off throughout dinner.
This is good for bitcoin.
Bingo!
!
No this s terrible.
Roller coaster got us to 20k and it will take us to 1,000,000.
Mr. Bill was great.
Why not?
Is it written somewhere that Reddit is supposed to a bastion of truth?
If I want truth Reddit isn't in the list of sources I use.
I think it's pretty clear that this sub is all about Bitcoin love, regardless of how connected to reality it may be.
And that's ok!
I disagree, as people refer to it often as a resource that they get their news from.
&gt; People upvote ~~anything~~ any shitty meme.
Yep.
[coincap.io](https://coincap.io) is best.
Well, I mean just because people do it doesn't change the quality of the information.
All kinds of people smoke knowing full well the health hazards.
Probably a bad analogy, but you get my drift?
it is not by chance that an adversarial system (court) is the most widely recognized method of discovering truth.
It's a good thing you're not the judge of that.
DIS WUT BITCOIN NEEDS.

It's a perfect analogy.
In that analogy, the fact that smoking causes cancer is not okay, just like in this analogy, the fact that the subreddit can be blatantly misleading is not just something that's "ok"

Thanks for that analogy, it's perfect.
It really depends what parts, but yeah in a lot of parts of course it's frustrating.
Notably this one.
Well, I am, and you're welcome to disagree.
You'd be wrong.

if I find out its bs I'mma down vote it.
Its at 6k not to well.
Don't you dare.
I'll upvote it.
Hey man, you are entitled to your opinion.
I'm entitled to the truth.
Oh you care about truth now?
lol.
No.
I don't care about it.
I'm just infallible.
I am truth.
Obey me.
Pawn.

The sooner people in bitcoin learn not to not care about the "news," that may or may not affect the price, the better though.
It's not about the price.
In fact, the news tends to not affect the price too much except for during a few outlying events.
People in general should strive for truth unless they're striving for satire.
The issue is when people say hyperbolic things all the time that aren't based in any truth and it's meant to be taken seriously and people even downvote anyone pointing out the truth in the comments to bury reality.

Summary: 
It's not about the price.
I don't care about it.
Oh you care about truth now?
I'm entitled to the truth.
