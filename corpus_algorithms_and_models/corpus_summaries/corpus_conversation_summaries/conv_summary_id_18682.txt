Very nice!
I consider myself educated.
For some reason I've developed a thing for [very sharp high resolution photos](http://imgur.com/a/hWV0W) What pains me is that 1024x768 was the standard resolution twenty years ago, yet even today it's not easy to find quality images online with higher resolutions.

If you expect them to look like mannequins, then that's true.
If you expect them to look like real people, I think they look amazing.
Traditionally, celebrities are NOT expected to look like real people.

Summary: 
If you expect them to look like mannequins, then that's true.
