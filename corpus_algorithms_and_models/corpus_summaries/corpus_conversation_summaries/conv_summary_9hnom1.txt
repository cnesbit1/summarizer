Guys, let's cool down for a minute.
This isn't over yet and just because we touched 6.7k doesn't mean we are in a bull run up to anywhere.
One whale drop to 6.1k and everything goes back.
No, to the mooooon :) 

Seriouy, is anyone really expecting it to go past 7k?
Yeah, we’ll hit 7k over the weekend.
It's an option, but do you believe it will stay there?
You could make arguments either way, the best I can offer is that it “feels” like the bear market has ended.
yes it looks like it and it's bull season anyway.
