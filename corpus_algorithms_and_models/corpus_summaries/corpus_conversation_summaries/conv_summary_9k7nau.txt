I'm very close to walking out of mine.
I was subjected to a bunch of radfem rubblish masquerading as a sermon.

Honestly you can grow more with God but just staying at home and studying for yourself, most of these churches peach fluff anyways.
God does not even require of us to go to church, he wants us to keep his sabbath and have a close relationship with him.
Donâ€™t need a building for that.
Ah, good.
Now you know how all women have felt being bashed with inferiority and male dominance forever.
It helps to see the other side of the street....
No it doesn't.
Watching what is supposed to be a sermon on the day's readings turned into one woman's personal anti-male crusade goes against the Bible itself.
&amp;#x200B;
I'll bet that payback hurt!
LOL

Could you at least try to understand what women go through and have gone through?
Do unto others, after all....
Lol I got to see that sermon!
So you admit this is all about "payback" and vengeance?
Thank you for being honest about what feminism is about.
Yes, do unto others.
Start with yourself.

This is the same kind of whining that happened during the civil rights movement of the 60's and 70's.
Sometimes cultures make corrections,  thank God!, and they are often very hard swings.
And only zealots have the courage to lead.
She is on the side of equality and that may take time to settle into place.
Be patient.

No, no it isn't.
&gt;Sometimes cultures make corrections,  thank God!, and they are often very hard swings.
And sometimes they move backwards.
Can I introduce you to some Scriptural concepts?
&gt;Galatians 3 28:29  
&gt;  
&gt;**There is neither** Jew nor Greek, **there is neither** bond nor free, **there is neither male** nor **female**: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus

As opposed to "there are BAD MEN and HOLY GOOD WOMEN".
&gt;And only zealots have the courage to lead.

You know what?
I've seen the light.
I should have known all along that the core message of Jesus of Nazareth was "white men are all evil, and women are all pure, and saintly."
&gt;Be patient.
Yeah, sure.
&amp;#x200B;

Like I said.
It sounds exactly the same.
Um, no.
You see, back in the civil rights days, they were trying to bring people together.
No Jew or Gentile, you see that above.
No division.
No special treatment of one group over another.
Giving everyone legal rights.
Treating everyone the same and moving towards unity, as was commanded by the Gospel.
What this modern stuff is trying to do is get rid of things like "due process" towards men, and set women against men.
That's in opposition to the Gospel.
So you are wrong.
&amp;#x200B;
You obviously were not alive during that time period at all.
That isn't what happened at all.
Societies don't do that.
It was a series of cosmic pendulum swings that terrified and upset the whole nation.
It was painful, traumatic, violent and only partially successful.
Just like this.
Yeah, I was actually.
People marched - both black and white - against things like the Jim Crow laws.
Against segregation.
Against the idea that certain people deserved rights and others did not - and that some groups were "better" than others.
Now, they're marching for the inverse.
Which is against Scripture and the will of God.
&amp;#x200B;
Wow.
We will just have to disagree.
How can you disagree that the Civil Rights movement was designed to break down barriers and treat black and white people equally?
To get rid of segregation, to integrate schools, churches, lunch counters?
That that is in the spirit of the Scriptures, which clearly says "there is no Jew or Greek, no male or female."
I don't see how you can disagree about that.
But if you wish, that's your perogative.
Blessings to you.
&amp;#x200B;
Wow.
What a double back flip.
Amazing.
So, in other words, you have nothing to contribute to this conversation except insults, snarky remarks, and your own feelings.
&amp;#x200B;
That Lady really upset you, didn't she?
My gosh.
You can't even disagree without hostility....
What, the Gospel message of fixing and rebuilding being replaced with an "us vs them" radical political stance?
That upsets me.
She does not.
I can disagree, I'm just waiting for you to say something other than

\- Ha, ha.
She hurt you.
Good.
\- You're whining

\-  I want men to hurt

\-  Insult, ad hominem, insult.
You haven't yet, so there's really been no discussion thus far for me to agree or disagree with.
&amp;#x200B;

Summary: 
I don't see how you can disagree about that.
We will just have to disagree.
That isn't what happened at all.
That's in opposition to the Gospel.
