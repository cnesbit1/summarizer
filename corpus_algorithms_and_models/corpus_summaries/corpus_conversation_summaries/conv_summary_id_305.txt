Original Response: 
My dad lives in Corpus.
He is having some computer issues.
He took his computer to Geek Squad and didn't feel they were helpful.
Does anyone know a good IT support person for a home computer - preferably someone that could go to his home?
thanks.
There are several computer / IT companies in town, none that I can really suggest off the top of my head right now.

Nerds, (361) 814-6373 (While I really don't prefer their in house stuff, but their on site guy may be ok.)I'm not sure if the following have on site services, but it would be worth it to call and check:Future Tech, (361) 991-8669(How do you get so many 5 star Google reviews?
I need to take lessons.
Its borderline not legit!

I have no clue on prices, and can't really suggest anyone, as I haven't been working in Corpus in over a year.
You gave it your best shot.Here's another one that has a good rep;The Laptop Shop:6500 S Padre Island Dr Ste 15(361) 852-8131 I can recommend another one but they are clear out at Rockport: Tech Time Computer Repair.
I honestly haven't heard good things about The Laptop Shop, can confirm Tech Time though, seem like good people.
Thank you very much for the reply.
I really appreciate it!
Thank you very much!
Thank you very much!
Can confirm Tech Time; I worked there for a short stint.
They get swamped during the Winter Texan season, so be prepared for a few days wait.
Their turnaround is 2-4 days longest when they are busy.
They are well-meaning and stick to high standards of service, so yeah, I'm biased but a witness to their work.
Did you find the help for your dad's computer yet?
Sorry for the delay.
My brother is flying down this week to see what he can do to help out.
Thank you so much for checking!
