Youâ€™ve already done horror and comedy together, if you were to do another movie, what genre would it be next time?
:) love you both!
Canâ€™t wait to see The Little Stranger!
Correction: suspenseful atmospheric thriller - not horror!
;)
DG - Erotica?
Dg- Lenny?
Dg - Lenny?
DG - Hello, Lenny?
DG - Lenny?
DG - .......

DG - Lenny?
LA ðŸ¤®.
Hahaha!
...Lenny?
pls Lenny.
With Adam Driver, I guess?
His boobs in your hands would be beautiful picture.
Thousands fanarts confirms this omg wtf I wrote.
yeah ... Iâ€˜d watch that.
Iâ€˜d watch the heck out of that.
Domhnall, what has been the best failed attempt at pronouncing your name?
I heard once '' DOMINOL ''
DG - Tonio.
I was simultaneously appalled and incredibly impressed.
That sounds like something Tobias Funke would shill with his family band.
That is impressive!
From Irish to Italian  in one fell swoop.
My favourite was when the ET ride at Universal Florida called my Ma 'Sigh-oh-ban'.
Lol gotta Dom em all.
I believe Leonardo DiCaprio called him Dumble during an awards ceremony once.
And then Alejandro IÃ±Ã¡rritu called him Dom-hall.
DOMINOS.
Since I can't guess what your mom's name is, how is it spelled?
Both noble efforts.
Probably Siobhan, pronounced *shiv awn*.
It's SiobhÃ¡n.
Pronounced 'Shiv-awn'.
In fairness, if people aren't familiar with it they don't stand a chance.
Kind of like Polish names.
They don't work trying to sound them out.
Like the MMA fighter Joanna Janxjcjeoakeeeeezzzznkkkkk.
[Tonio?!

Lol I was just looking at a thread with her doing a mock face-off with another Polish fighter.
Battle of the consonants.
If in were the announcer I would just say "Johnson" or "Fletcher" and call it good.
Or Player 1 and Player 2 and just ask them to wear Red and Blue respectively.
KEN vs. RYU!
ROUND ONE, FIGHT!
[Here's a few more--"Downhill" is the best of 'em!...
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48SJ1Yg7JQY)
can confirm: am American, was confused by the `m`
If you're not asleep in 30 minutes or less, my name isn't _The..._

we're all supposed to say it together guys, that's the tag.
My name isn't...

Are you even paying attention?
Wait did you take the Dominol again?
Dom-hall

Is...is that not correct?
No, I'm not Irish or anything but I think it's "dohnull".
Basically the m is silent.
I friend of mine once couldnâ€™t quite remember DGâ€™s name, so referred to him as Abdominal Geese Man.
Like the word tonal, but starting with a D. Dough-null.
By them?
!
I have a cousin called shivawn, it took me 25 years to realize it was the same name as seeobhan.
Not the m being silent, but rather, there is no letter W in Gaelic so that sound is represented as "MH".
The same applies to Siobhan: there's no V and that sound is written BH.
There are dozens of us!
DOZENS!

Summary: 
Kind of like Polish names.
I was simultaneously appalled and incredibly impressed.
With Adam Driver, I guess?
