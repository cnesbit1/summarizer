Original Response: 
I been havin this nightmare about this chapter for about half a year now.
The details in the dream vary but it always has the same general plot.
Im a Hebrew warrior in Moses's army.
We are marching to the city of the Midianites.
All I know is that I'm here to fight, nothing more.
We arrive at the city and see several old ladies and young women nursing their babies in camps on the outskirts of the city.
The women have this motherly look that is quite charming.
I lose my serious face and proceed to smile at them, one baby giggles after seeing me, the rest are crying.
Moses pats me on the shoulder and I learn that apparently I'm a captain or some shit.
He gives me his scimitar and says, "I'll let you have the honors of first kill.''
At first I didn't have a clue what he meant, but then he starts gesturing towards the women and children.
When he said that I was shocked, I had no idea that was the plan.
So I froze for several minutes, my heart was beating, hands shaky, knees weak.
Moses kept staring into my face and I couldn't maintain eye contact.
His fatherly face starting to take on a new look.
He was getting impatient.
Finally I got my shit together, even then I could barely speak without havin to pause cuz of the knot in my throat.
I told him I can't do it, and he said he was very disappointed in me.
He sat down and covered his face with his hands for a minute or so.
Everybody including me just waited for his order, but he just sat there.
Then he jerked up and his face was totally changed.
He walked over to the baby boy that had giggled at me and before the mother could protest he knocked her out with a single thud.
He grabbed the baby by the arm and flung him at the rocks.
I started crying uncontrollably, a grown ass man like me bawlin.
I turned my head cuz that baby was still movin even after he had hit the sharp rocks.
He was still jerkin and I turned away, sunk to my knees, and cried.
That's normally how the dream ends, and it's not the only type of dream I have about this sort of thing.
What do you think this is?
How am I spose to feel about this?
Cuz the way I'm feelin now in a nutshell is best described by one of my comments below,

&gt;*If I was a Midianite virgin girl I would die first rather than let the Hebrews take me, just like my African ancestors jumped off ships rather than accept slavery and all its trappings*

&amp;#x200B;
You are having weird dreams.
But my dream is based off of biblical history.
Read numbers 31.
Moses really did do this.
OK  but I don't know a single other person anywhere who dreams in Bible stories.
(True or not)


This comes to us within the world of textural criticism.
Did in fact the Israelis armies commit genocide or not?
IDK, still a weird dream.
My mother had a few dreams with biblical context, and prolly a few others in my family.
I done had dreams about hell and stuff like that.
A family thing I guess.
I really have no idea what else to say.
Before this dream I tried to tell myself, *God did it for the better*, or *they deserved it*.
But how is one gonna free people who were in slavery and had their babies killed by Egyptians, only to order them to kill babies and enslave people?
Hypocritical if you ask me.
The Hebrews weren't no different than the Egyptians.
It matters not who commits the action, only the action itself matters.
Think about it, if our African/European ancestors determined the morality of an action based on who does it, a criminal strangling a baby would've been called a crime, but a man of ''god'' doing the very same action would be called ''righteous''.
It seems our *pagan* ancestors were better than this.
Since I'm not jewish, it's obvious my ancestors were *pagan*.
I researched and found out they worshipped trees and rocks, nevertheless they didn't kill no babies like the Hebrews.
Then ask yourself do I deserve any of the blessings I have received?
God doesn't operate on deserve or not deserve.
He operates on whatever His plans are.
Then why did he kill them?
IDK.
sorry, ask God.
Good answer, at least you didn't tell me ''those were the old days'' or some crap like that.


There is a trend when nations do things God hates.
Specifically as it pertains to Midian, they were a nation of the LORD and they did not live accordingly.
...avenge the LORD of Midian.
Numbers:31:3 

Numbers 25 is commented on here:

But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
Revelation:2:14

Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
1 Corinthians:10:8

God sent a plague as a punishment to kill the people of the nation of Israel.
And God told Moses:

Vex the Midianites, and smite them:
Numbers:25:17

Read some of these references:

Deuteronomy chapter 9:1-6, Leviticus 18:24-30, Leviticus 20:22-24.
...for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
Leviticus:20:23

Don't forget about the flood, Nineveh, or Sodom and Gomorrah.
Oh so if my child ceases to love me I should just kill him, or maim him?
Let's do a comparison shall we?
While worshipping idols, fornication was committed, aka doing a basic bodily function as well as worshipping stone who have no ears or eyes, yet god jealous of them.
God is jealous of rock and stone!
Wow, talk about insecurity issues...
While worshipping god, tens of thousands of babies are killed and young virgin women get to watch their parents die and are then forced into marriage.
It aint like they had a choice.
I can't help it you have a problem with the God of the Bible.
You can either obey the Gospel, or get in line with everyone else that rejects it:

In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:
2 Thessalonians:1:8.
Ok, so if you were from that time, would you take the sword or drop it?
Which one is it gonna be?
If you even have the slightest hesitation in answering this question then I guess there's some heart in you yet...
[deleted]
My question seems to have hit all the right spots.
I doubt you'd take the sword, youza a man not a monster.
The true man takes off his armor and lays down the sword.
And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
Joshua:24:15

I'm going with the LORD.
The OT was a different time with a different type of conflict.
The concept you have to understand is now we have a different type of battle.
It is a spiritual battle:

For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
Ephesians:6:12.
Or maybe you're wrestling against natural desires no different than the desire to eat or sleep, against the desire to ask questions.
Sometimes the light is harmful.
Look at newborn babies, a good mother never let's bright light shine directly into a newborn's face like they do in hospitals.
Spiritually speaking, the light can burn.
Don't go the way of Icarus.
Icarus floated so high that he burned up in the sun's flames.
This is a metaphor for those who try to ascend their humanity and give up their *fleshliness*.
It never ends well.
I wrestle against violence and brutality, now are you gonna answer my question from earlier or what?
I am confused now.
I don't know what your talking about again.
&gt;*For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
Ephesians:6:12*

Still confused.
I'm talking about this.
You say you wrestle against powers and principalities, a mind set much needed to sow the seeds of bitter isolationism.
You say you wrestle against the rulers of the darkness, yet doesn't the bible say that god dwells in *thick darkness*.
I wrestle against, as I've already said, violence and brutality.
And my question from earlier is, would you take hold of the sword?
&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
If I was in Numbers 31, absolutely.
I believe the God of the Bible.
Let me make my position as you already quoted it for me.
I believe the God of the Bible everything that contradicts His word is a lie.
Believe it or not much of what I done said don't contradict the word at all.
When I said that the god of the bible was jealous of stone and wood I was of course being truthful, the bible seems to embrace this fact.
Genocide was the norm for Old Testament religion, the irony is that they complained about the Assyrians throwing Hebrew babies against the rocks just a few centuries after the Midianite slaughter.
What goes around comes around I guess.
POW slavery, sacrifice of animals by the thousands, conquest, isolationism, xenophobia, all these things made the Israelites not much different than their neighbors.
You can go ahead and say *But the Israelites worshipped Yahweh, their neighbors didn't*.
The actions speak for itself.
Okay.
So do you believe the Bible?
All of it?
If someone asked you what your religion was, what would you say?
I don't worship the god of the bible, what I am saying is that the Hebrews woulda had no qualms with what modern day Christians call *the evils of this world*, since they were agents of some of these evils, using them to spread their religion.
Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and Krishnaism all generally have the same domination theme going for them which is why I don't follow them.
I follow the indigenous Bushmen and Yoruba religions.
As to whether or not I believe in the Bible, I'll say this: Though not all the bible is historical, and though evidence can be presented to show that it's god went through some degree of development and elaboration, his existence can't be proved or disproved.
So even though I admit that his existence is possible, I can prove that if he is real, he's not creator.
1: The word for create in Hebrew is *bara*.
Hebrew is a Semitic language, related to Arabic and Akkadian.
Akkadian's word for cut/separate is *parasu*, related to Hebrew *bara.

The myth of separating the heavens and the earth is present is Akkadian and Sumerian mythology.
*Bara* originally meant *to separate*, so Elohim didn't create the earth even if he is real.
This interpretation fits well given that a few verses later Genesis says he *separated* the light from the darkness.

Also it's obvious that Yahweh isn't omnipotent or omniscient.
He *remembered* Noah, he wrestled with Jacob, he couldn't overcome the *iron chariots*, Jesus doesn't know when the rapture is going to happen (Jesus means *Yah saves*), he's jealous of wood and stone, ect.
All this demonstrates that if Yahweh is real, I don't haft to worship him.
In Exodus 32:14, Yahweh repents of the evil which he planned to do to Israel, which means Yahweh is a sinner.
Thanks for the clarification.
I will have to research the indigenous Bushman and Yoruba religions.
So your purpose in reading the Bible is what?
Your motivation for discussing and refuting Christistianity is what?
Out of curiosity, how did you come to your belief system?
So do you believe that Christianity is a legit religion?
In that it is real or is it just another mythology?
If the *god* of Christianity is a real being this doesn't necessarily mean that we should all worship him.
I know you might not be ready to look at the situation as being this complex, but I will elaborate anyway.
If Yahweh isn't just another myth, the fact that *Elohim* is plural (the royal we didn't exist in Hebrew monarchies, notice Saul, David, and Solomon never used it), and that Deuteronomy 32:8-9 describes the most high (god) apportioning the nations to the gods according to “the number of the sons of Israel/gods”, means Yahweh wouldn't be the only spirit out there.
And certainly not the most powerful.
Yeshua/Yahweh claimed to have not known when the rapture is goin to happen, just imagine what else he didn't know.
I decided that if I was going to ''follow'' any spirits, it would be the ones who don't demand absolute, brain-dead obedience, who don't commit atrocious acts like the destruction of innocent lives.
The bushmen never went on crusades or any of that shit.
I reached my conclusion after a decade of being the most scrutinizing Christian, learning Hebrew and Greek, researching history, archeology, symbolism.
I read numerous bible texts and found out many surprising things, l never knew that the earliest Greek new testament didn't even have Revelations for instance.
In the end, secular history and science wasn't what turned me away from Yahweh.
The bible did.
I realized the world is a thousand times more complex than the way it is portrayed by the simplistic biblical view.
After years of having a *relationship with God*, I realized that submission, isolationism, and repression isn't the way.
I will not be snared, even by promises of eternal life.
Thank you for being honest.
You spent time researching the Bible and ended up deciding it was not true.
I do not mind disagreeing with people.
We all have to choose for ourselves what we will believe.
You have made what you believe to be an informed decision.
It has been an entertaining discussion.
Thank you for your time.

Summary: 
I believe the God of the Bible.
I don't know what your talking about again.
So do you believe the Bible?
I do not mind disagreeing with people.
I can't help it you have a problem with the God of the Bible.
