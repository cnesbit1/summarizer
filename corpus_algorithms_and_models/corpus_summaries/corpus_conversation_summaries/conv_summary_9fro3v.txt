Draco ex Machina, the ultimate storytelling move against long-lasting immortal overlords.

Imma politely disagree that it was an asspull and that they did it to end him prematurely after they spent a good chunk of an Xpac on his culture and society and then another 3 chapters on his grand plan, but we all have our opinions.
Cute edit tho, props for it!
Thanks!
My issue with this storytelling is:

1) For 3 chapters, we had more like random things happen with Kralk and not knowing whether Joko was even real.
Then SUDDENLY it appears he really escaped, and then

2) in a *single episode* we gather a tiny makeshift "army" of a bunch of random people, we infiltrate the facility, and *single-handedly* take down an iconic villain with a useless weepy NPC by our side, without any plan to finish off an undead immortal being, just to then SUDDENLY have him finished off by a convenient dragon.
Maybe that's just me, but I'm not buying this "power fantasy".
That's lazy, to me it feels like no long-term planning goes into the story, it's just cobbled together by different teams to make each part enjoyable to an average teen player who plays 10 things at the same time and doesn't really care.
(And remembering how they told that they "didn't know who we were going to fight in the second expansion" for a surprisingly long time, yes, that seems just very true.)
I'm not really "mad" about all this and neither I demand them to make things "good enough for me"; it's fine for a casual no-sub MMO, I guess, it's just that I find it underwhelming and stopped caring about the story part of the game by now.
They actually admitted in the 6th anniversary video they killed him off so soon because they didn't feel they could turn what was a comedic relief character originally into a compelling villain.
And that some devs regret that because they did manage to make him a compelling villain.
Even ignoring that, though, Episode 3 had utterly destroyed the build-up in the threat that Joko presented in the previous two episodes (and Current Events).
Even right off the bat with the whole, super-illogical and nonsensical "the Scarab Plague can only infect humans" (which really does make zero sense biologically).
Then he doesn't really do \*anything\* of meaningful threatening value during the whole episode, just a bunch of taunting (mind you, the taunting was done excellently, but still).
The speech and cinematic animations were glorious, but E3 ruined all the build up, and it really felt to me like all creativity went into the final instance, just to get ruined by what really was a gag method of killing Joko.
Not to mention that given the camera angles, Aurene had to have phased through walls for neither the players nor Joko to see her coming.
Add in what Lishtenbird said in point #2.
&gt; Not to mention that given the camera angles, Aurene had to have phased through walls for neither the players nor Joko to see her coming.
Oh man, wouldn't it have been great if she had come in through the window?
The player would see her in the sky and then **\*wham\***, Joko kibble right in front of us.
Would be far less of a gag kill then, at least.
&gt;Even right off the bat with the whole, super-illogical and nonsensical "the Scarab Plague can only infect humans" (which really does make zero sense biologically).
It does.
Around the time the Scarab plague was around, there were only humans living in Faranhur (the place it originated from).
A plague from a biological standpoint needs hosts to spread.
How exactly you expect a plague who grew amongst humans to all of a sudden be able to affect other races totally different from one another?
Real world example: Don't humans have diseases that animals can't have?
And vice versa?
it's the exact same thing.
Yo friend.
I have nothing against you not liking about the story but your facts are straight out wrong.
For 3 chapters dealing with random kralk things?
The only true kralk focused instance was the epilogue of PoF followed by the first instance of LS4 ep1.
&gt;and not knowing whether Joko was even real.
Then SUDDENLY it appears he really escaped, and then 


What you mean not knowing he is even real?
You hear his voice in the first ep when Taimi is kidnapped, You SEE him in the 2nd episode and interact with him.
But you *know* of his existance ever since Gw1.
We also knew since 2012 that he had built for himself quite a powerful empire over the Crystal Desert.
You interact with him during the 2nd chapter of PoF as well.
&gt;  in a single episode we gather a tiny makeshift "army" of a bunch of random people


Kinda wrong.
Random people ?
No.
First the ghosts.
You had to prove you were not one of the robbers or an ally of Joko when you first enter that place.
You oay your respects and show your value to them.
They had a grudge against Joko, and more specifically, the plague itself.
Their kindgom was wiped by it afterall.
Second, the new charr tribe.
We help them out in the second episode fight off the Inquest and the Awakened when we take down their lab.
Charr of that village were used as test subjects for the research they had all the reasons to help us out.
Third, the sunspears.
Ofc they would join us.
Think I don«t need to explain why.
You make some decent points tho.
Knowing he was immortal, and knowing not even Turai Ossa could kill him, going in there without a plan was silly.
I guess they had just planned to go in there and chain him up.
I also agree he was killed off a bit too soon, but only because I wanted his threat to grow a bit bigger.
He was a cool villian, but IMO not one to attach for too long.
But well that's just one's opinion anyways.
Okay, four things.
1.
I said it doesn't make sense for **only** humans.
And technically, while they were around Fahranur, that doesn't mean only humans were.
2.
The Scarab Plague is time and time again called a pestilence, "not a plague".
It isn't a disease, it isn't bacteries.
It's a **parasite**, and while parasites do have preferred hosts, they don't have only one type of potential host.
3.
Developer explanation for why only humans were vulnerable was "they're not from the world so they didn't build up immunity" and this makes no sense for two reasons.
A) Being exposed to it before, Elonians would have built up a resistance and passed that on in their genes; might not be full immunity, but a resistance all the same.
B) Non-Elonian races wouldn't have built up a resistance due to lack of exposure, unless once upon a time the Scarab Plague was global; this in turn means that norn and asura, above all else, should be vulnerable just as much as non-Elonian humans (charr do have suggestions of having influence in Elona, but it's unlikely to have been widepsread or early enough to have exposure to the parasitic breed of scarabs).
4.
Neither bacteria nor parasites would have survived a thousand years if their sole host had disappeared.
This means they **had** to have other hosts, and [GW1 suggests](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/A_Troubling_Theory) that the local wildlife served as hosts too, even if in a slightly different method.
And for the record, the plague didn't grow amongst humans so much as suddenly outbreak among humans.
Even if it were a gem-based disease (and it isn't),
For the first point, we don't really know.
But if I had to bet, would be only humans living in those places.
For the second point.
It is described that the Scarab plague attacks his hosts, lays down their eggs in them, they grow get nasty attack rip off their flesh and spread to other hosts.
Now a simple explanation: Acidity.
The blood of humans is, lets say less acid than the blodd of other races and thats the blood they have adapted to.
This is just an example tho.
For the third point, well I wasn't aware the devs gave an explanation but their explanation is sloppy.
Asuras lived their entire lives underground and Norn up in the north, there are no scarabs on those places so makes no sense for them to build resistences to them.
Finally the 4th point, they didn't lived that long.
We learn in the story that what Joko is trying to do is to revive the plague (possibly by digging up old corpses consumed by it or smth) which further proves my points that the Scarab plague was specifically adapted to attack human hosts.
To remember the inquest had specialists in the area, like Gorick, working for them doing research.
The plague was over, it was just revived by them.
The video said he couldn't be the final boss of Season 4 because they had other plans on who to make the finale about, not that they were looking to sweep him under the rug.
Joko had more screen time, more development, and a bigger focus on him than any singular villain in GW1 or 2.
I won't say they couldn't have done a better job, him not having a direct presence instead of an implied one in LS4 ep1 would have been better IMO as an example, but he was a far cry from "killed off for a the sake of it" like I see people saying.
Also per the plague it could only spread and incubate through humans, fully fledged scarabs would still rampage and murder everything in their path (which is why 3rd generation still made everyone panic at the fort when they opened the gate, despite there being no humans present).
Even then, Joko had a ton of reanimated Inquest tinkering away at new ways to weaponize and apply the plague to boot.
It may have not been long before they found a strain that would incubate in other species too.
If any part of Joko's Plague plan needed to be criticised, it was that he used his stolen portals from the Sandswept Isles to attack with his soldiers instead of waiting patiently for the Plague to be air dropped into central tyria when it was ready.
He got greedy, and lost his chance at free, instant plague bombs.
The Aurene angle bugged me too, but honestly that one feels like a nitpick more than a complaint.
Aurene killing Joko was meant to be as shocking for the player as it was for him, which is why the entire instance thereafter had people just not be comfortable with her eating him like that.
Taimi shouldn't have been there to freak out like she did though, Braham and Canach handled the levity of the situation while still injecting humour in a way that didn't detract from the scene.
&gt; their explanation is sloppy.
Asuras lived their entire lives underground and Norn up in the north, there are no scarabs on those places so makes no sense for them to build resistences to them.
Exactly my point.
Glad we agree there.
&gt; Finally the 4th point, they didn't lived that long.
We learn in the story that what Joko is trying to do is to revive the plague (possibly by digging up old corpses consumed by it or smth) which further proves my points that the Scarab plague was specifically adapted to attack human hosts.
To remember the inquest had specialists in the area, like Gorick, working for them doing research.
The plague was over, it was just revived by them.
Except we weren't dealing with undead scarabs but live ones.
So they had to have remained living *somehow*, even if only in hibernation.
Though I've never heard of a hibernation that lasts for a thousand years.
Well we are in a fantasy world.
We came back from the death, there are ghosts wandering around, an immortal lich.
There are demi-gods, magic and all sorts of things.
One of the elite specs even messes with time travel ..
I think applying that kind of logic will lead us no where.
Dead plagues?
Yeah no big deal they have Joko who is a lich in the end, a necromancer.
Manipulating inanimate objects should be easy for him.
Also could be explained with a bit of science.
The scarabs that ported this plague lived once, died.
The inquest picked off their dead bodies, did an analysis on the DNA, compared to current Scarabs, saw the differences and ran tests from there.
I think we have real cases of stuff like this.
As to how the corpses did not de-compose or smth .. it hasn't been that long.
The dynasty ended around 600 DR which is around 400 AE Tyrian calendar, so around 900 years ago only if I'm not mistaken.
Some of the bodies could've remained intact protected by smth, sorta like a fossile.
&gt; One of the elite specs even messes with time travel

Well, that was brought up to a dev and the dev (Scott McGough iirc) responded that it was messing with the perception of time, not actual time travel, or something.
&gt; Dead plagues?
Yeah no big deal they have Joko who is a lich in the end, a necromancer.
Manipulating inanimate objects should be easy for him.
And if it was a swarm of undead scarabs, then I would agree.
But resurrection magic has been lost for over two centuries, and this is a plot point which makes our own resurrection such a "omgwtfbbq" thing in PoF.
They may be bugs, but bringing dead bugs to life is still resurrection.
As to the Inquest stuff, we don't really have evidence of cloning or genetic manipulation in the game, so that's kind of hard to agree with.
Sure, you can rationalize a lot of it, but it just felt incredibly rushed at the end of the day.
A lot of people, me included, thought Joko would be *the* villain for this season; to suddenly have him die almost out of the blue with however many episodes left just felt like bad storytelling.
About the "not knowing whether Joko was real" part; there was speculation by some people during the first and second episode that the real Joko was still trapped in the Mists and that the one running around Tyria was an impostor.
That's probably what he meant.
Yeah that doesn't really work.
You can't just excuse potential plot holes with "well the setting has magic, hurrdurr, therefore it doesn't have to make sense".
No, even fantasy needs rules and consistent internal logic in order for storytelling to be satisfying.
Guild Wars 2 generally does a poor job of it, but that's hardly an excuse.
Lets make this clear: When you have a world where you can teleport around, come back from the dead and such, normal boundries and logic cannot be applied here.
The comment I was responding to was questioning how the plague survived for so long, and how they were able to revive it if it was dead.
I even gave a scientific explanation.
If you really want to go that way however, have you ever wondered how zhaitan minions are even possible?
Orr was underwater for roughly 150 years.
Underwater mind you.
So how was he able to create minions from dead bodies (the in-game models have flesh and such) if no bones shouldn't even exist due to decomposition.
So yeah being a part of a fantasy world does explain a lot of stuff.
We can't nitpick and look at things that rationally.
Reason and logic should come with the story, the motives and personal agenda of the characters, the world movement and general plot point, not details such as these ones we are discussing right now.
It's all theories in the end for sure.
Do note my thesis is that the plague was long gone and they were able to bring it back through research.
It's what I'm defending here.
And I think you missed my point.
They did not need to bring back the bugs to life, they only needed to understand their genome and try to replicate it with live species.
This is a totally accpetable scientific explanation IMO as it is a real world scenario.
&gt;Lets make this clear: When you have a world where you can teleport around, come back from the dead and such, normal boundries and logic cannot be applied here.
&amp;#x200B;

Except I didn't say "normal boundaries and logic"; I said "*internal* consistency and logic"; there's a world of difference between the two.
It's just basic storytelling; it is very difficult, if not impossible, to craft a satisfying story if your audience does not know the *basic rules* of your setting; there's nothing clever or satisfying about a writer pulling a solution to a problem out of their ass, or vice versa, fabricating a problem out of nowhere.
This is *especially* important in a setting that contains magic and/or extremely advanced technology.
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The comment I was responding to was questioning how the plague survived for so long, and how they were able to revive it if it was dead.
I even gave a scientific explanation.
&amp;#x200B;

You're kind of missing the point.
You can explain it and rationalize it in any number of ways, but the point is that *we* shouldn't have to.
I'm not saying that a work of fiction has to (or even should) explain *every detail* of the story and setting to their audience as if they're complete morons, but the return of the Scarab Plague is (or at least *should be*) such a major plot point that it would be nice if there was at least some kind of plausible hint as to how exactly Joko revived it; instead all we get is vague allusions to "Inquest experiments", which is basically tantamount to a writer saying: "well we want the plague back in the story, so something something Asura technology".
It's just lazy and contrived.
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you really want to go that way however, have you ever wondered how zhaitan minions are even possible?
Orr was underwater for roughly 150 years.
Underwater mind you.
So how was he able to create minions from dead bodies (the in-game models have flesh and such) if no bones shouldn't even exist due to decomposition.
&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, "Guild Wars 2 generally does a poor job of it, but that's hardly an excuse."
You're trying to excuse one thing not making sense because... another thing doesn't make sense.
Your argument basically boils down to "nothing makes sense in Guild Wars 2, so it's fine if something doesn't make sense", and you're not exactly wrong, but that also means that Guild Wars 2 is an extremely bad fantasy setting.
&amp;#x200B;

Edit: because of format changes to reddit, apparently

&amp;#x200B;
Episode 2 Joko: "I am not into meaningless monologues any more, now I'm about efficiency and fulfilling my grand design".
&amp;#x200B;

Episode 3 Joko: "COME AT ME BRO 1vs1 ME" \**dies*\*

&amp;#x200B;

They finally managed to create a single interesting unique NPC and then few episodes later they just kill him off without following up on any of his previous plot hooks... and our big plan/accomplishment on how we did it?
We just walked in, through his traps, and smacked him around.
And then we got lucky because even though he actually is immortal... he's not immortal enough for our flying, usually inconsequential, plot device.
A real world scenario, but as I said, unlike the real world, Tyrians don't seem to be at the level of DNA testing, cloning, or genetic manipulation.
I mean, the Inquests' most advanced science seems to be combining dragon energies into a single minion.
And that came out of tests that were literally "just expose them to dragon magic and see what happens".

Summary: 
The plague was over, it was just revived by them.
