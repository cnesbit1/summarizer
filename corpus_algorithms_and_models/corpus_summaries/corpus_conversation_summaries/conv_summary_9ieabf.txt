Works with religions also.
*Religion is the Platform, a specific church group is an establishment.

They do not represent the platform, but they use it to bolster their support.

So whenever you hear someone attacking the platform you should get really angry that they are choosing to be very indelicate and destructive to useful parts of society based on their personal anecdotes.

I dont think people are opposed to unions in general its just that they are usually run by politics and it just becomes politics on top of politics which leaves a bad taste in a lot of mouths.
When you've had political forces who have used their political power to suppress and stifle organised labour pretty much ever since organised labour has existed, it should come of little surprise that at some point in history, organised labour became political.
