Original Response: 
The key difference between the two tweets was the word "temporary".
The link to the PDF is the same.
The first tweet:

&gt; SEC Issues Order of Suspension of Trading in Bitcoin Tracker One (“CXBTF”) and Ether Tracker One (“CETHF”) http://ow.ly/GxOj30lKjlQ

URL: https://twitter.com/SEC_News/status/1038905740222779394

The second tweet:

&gt; The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the temporary suspension of trading in the securities Bitcoin Tracker One (“CXBTF”) and Ether Tracker One (“CETHF”) commencing at 5:30 pm EDT Sept. 9, 2018 and terminating at 11:59 pm EDT Sept. 20, 2018. http://ow.ly/GxOj30lKjlQ

Why their first tweet was "Order of Suspension of Trading" and the second was about "temporary suspension of trading"?
Why they posted this on Sunday and not during the normal working hours?
Is this manipulation?
you can't sell it on Sunday anyway.
What exchange do you use?
Bitcoin can be bought and sold 24/7.
How can you trade crypto while Jesus is watching?
Same as when I masturbate.
I just announce that I’m about to pleasure myself and ask him to turn away until I’m finished.
You should probably get him a pair of earplugs, out of courtesy.
Ok wise guy.
this post is about [CXBTF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXBTF/)... not bitcoin.
Well, it is evident that hodlers get rewarded, while daytrader wannabes get rekt already on this world.
So, would He really care about that?
The ETN they are talking about can only be traded during Nasdaq opening hours.
Ah, I thought they were suggesting that the SEC was influencing the price of bitcoin in general, not the specific ETN.
That’s...quite silly if it’s not tradeable during the window between tweets.
Nevertheless....  people at the SEC should be investigated for possible manipulation;  this is a very anomalous announcement.

Summary: 
this post is about [CXBTF](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CXBTF/)... not bitcoin.
The link to the PDF is the same.
