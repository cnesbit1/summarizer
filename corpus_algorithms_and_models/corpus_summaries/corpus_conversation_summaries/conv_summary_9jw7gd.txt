Original Response: 
I remember when this happened a lot of people were claiming phantom punch.
Certainly doesn’t look like anything lands flush, however there’s always the chance Marshall was just horrified to be in the ring with someone like Melvin and wanted a way out.
The replay clearly shows Melvin clipping Marshall on the ear.
He hit the deck with intention.
Wasn't even on the ear, that landed flush on the back of his skull.
also completely strange that once Marshall realized he would still be getting smashed on the ground, he immediately covered his head.
You'd think if he dropped like that he wouldn't be conscious enough to do that sort of thing reflexively.
Specifically under the Occipital Ridge, an incredibly sensitive part of the skull.
Even a relatively minor blow delivered at the right angle, somewhere around 45 degrees, can cause a knockout.
This was my first reaction as well.
I think he jumped down and stayed down.
Look at how his left foot kicks out from under him.
He was pretending to be out cold but then moved his arms to protect his head when he realised there might be follow up strikes.
Honestly dude I’m with you.
I don’t think it was a fix, but I do think Doug was scared to death and wanted out.
Doug loved to bang, but as soon as Melvin landed a shot, he knew he was out of his league and wanted out.
I'd never seen him look so tentative before the KO.
Coulda been a flash ko maybe.

Summary: 
I think he jumped down and stayed down.
Look at how his left foot kicks out from under him.
