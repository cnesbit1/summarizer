Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behavior and information processing.
They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.‚Äù
‚Äï Terence McKenna.
Terrance McKenna was a CIA spook.
Psychedelics don't give you anything but a false sense of enlightenment.
It's all part of the Gods not real psyop.
Have you done them yourself?
Because I have personally experienced and witnessed many positive changes in myself and others from experimenting with psychedelics.
Especially micro dosing.
Look into who pushed the drug culture movement, ask yourself why they pushed it so hard, what did they have to gain?
I'll give you a hint, "McKenna" is a fake name, and what group of people uses fake names to fool the goyim (oops).
If you look at his wiki his mother is conveniently left out ü§î.
The use of psychedelics as a mental and spiritual aid didnt start with mckenna though, it goes back throughout human history.
Exactly.
It‚Äôs so much bigger than one random point in history a few decades ago.
Yes it was used it primitive rituals, not in advanced societies.
It was pushed to have a degeneration effect on society and break down the system.
Around that time is when the globalists made a coup of sorts with government and "civil rights"/"feminism"
I don't know if Terrance was a spook or not but definately an asset.
I stumbled on this guy https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Murray.
I think he ran immense and broad spectrum human psyche experiments.
It's crazy the volume of crazy projects that ran under him.
Any read the other posts, these are sacred experiences, and much more effective then sitting in a corner trying to speak in tounges.
But back to murray this dude was the Centre piece of US exploration of the mind for military purposes, kazinzki, McKenna, I'm guessing a good chuck of everything in that era was grant and funded at berkley.
Truth be told learning about him really made me question which lens I look at the conspiracy world through.
What if  we are just good people making bad choices.
Much love all
Grahm Hitchcocks work on the topic of shaman culture is a fascinating.
As is his work about the younger dryas.
Puts the purple tents as the atlantians.
Just saying.
Terrance was part of the Jewish cabal group, he was one of the many that participated in "goyim control" through cults, he's assignment was the drug culture cult.
Cultists will cry out "man LSD showed me so much truth about the world and my reality" unironically thinking they don't sound like a cultist, please.
Who manufactured, made, and pushed LSD?
Look at all the leaders of cults during that time, can people's brain not see patterns?
It's ignorant to think we aren't still being experimented on, the CIA is not just going to change heart, Reddit is also a CIA asset.
Have you read any of his books?
Or actually eaten, snorted, boofed, smoked or injected aby psychedelics?
Your closed mindedness is disappointing.
If you knew as much as you are trying to act like you do, you would realize that people are people and some things just are.
Not completely "good" or "bad".
Maybe you should go eat some psychedlelic substance and read a book or two before you try to tell others about things you clearly don't know enough about, or just speculate and keep it at that.
Many of us have had lifechanging experiences from tripping, and for you to just attempt to write them off as another one of "the man's" tricks on us is ignorant.

You sound like controlled opposition, or a victim of the people you speak ill of,
I hope you find what you are looking for ib this life, but shit, i just don't think you understand life, maybe tripping could help you break free from that cage you're in.
Sorry if my words seem harsh, but it is impolite to speak ill of the dead, and btw its not a fake name, his brother and children are still alive.
McKenna is a fake name, he is actually Jewish.
One at look at his nose and its obvious.
You're the one that's being ignorant, Terrance is confirmed CIA at least at one point, you can argue naively that he "retired" and left the organization LOL.
I can't argue with a cultist, facts and truths won't ever reach you, you poor soul.
Fully agree.
But my lens of expecting inherent evil wavered looking at the totality of the experiments headed up by murray.
I did't say he left shit.
I asked you direct questions about whther you read any of his work, or if you have taken psychedelics
Seeing everything as black or white, or good or bad, is your choice, but i'd prefer that you state your opinions as such and not try to imply truth when really its a belief.
To say one look at that nose is ridiculous.
Gtfo of here.
You are a part of them,
"hurr durr have you done meth before!
Isint the best man fucking awesome right!"
I've only stated facts to you, you are the one using opinions and anecdotal examples.
Asking have I done the drugs personally is irrelevant to whether or not Terrance is a CIA spook or not.
All this shit is out there for you no discover, but your so caught in the trap that'll fight the truth tellers.
You may not but one of them but they got you by the balls and you don't even know it, real sad.

Summary: 
Have you read any of his books?
