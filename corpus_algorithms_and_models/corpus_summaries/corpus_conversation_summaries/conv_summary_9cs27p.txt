Original Response: 
DC's shit talk has been improving a ton over the years but in regards to Jon Jones he just keeps giving him so much material it doesn't even matter.
Yet Jones beat him twice.
Making him cry and the knocking him clean out.
There's really nothing DC can say because Jones has owned him where it counts.
He can say he's the heavyweight champ.
And he doesn't hit and run pregnant women.
Or brag about doing cocaine.
Or fail 3 drug tests, 2 for PEDs.
Or being a part of an athletic family that has several failed drug tests between them.

HW champ that was handed the belt by only having to beat 1 fighter.
He's double champ of thin divisions.
Not the real champ at 205 and didn't earn the belt at 265.
Jones is far superior.
He beat the HW with the most title defenses of all time and never popped for PEDs like Jones did.
I'd rather be DC.
Without having to earn his way up the ladder like everyone else.
Jones knocked him out clean and made him cry by beating him for 5rds.
It was a super fight, and not the first one ever.
What he did to earn the fight with Stipe was clean out his division besides the PED cheater who is suspended indefinitely.
Guy is undefeated at heavyweight.
13-0.
He was probably the most deserving of the shot regardless.
I feel like you don't actually watch fights.
Also undefeated in his previous run @heavyweight, not like he had no experience there.
&gt; He beat the HW with the most title defenses

"Just because you shot Jesse James doesn't make you Jesse James"
&gt; Yet Jones beat him twice

While cheating.
DC cheats by cutting so much weight.
I feel like you make up fantasies in your head to deal with things you don't agree with.
Hasn't fought at HW for 5 years and only has 2 wins in the UFC against fighters that are not even in contention anymore.
Try again.
He didn't clean out the HW division.
He wasn't the rightful contender and was handed the title shot because he kisses Dana's ass.
Ok now i know you’re trolling.
Oooohhh, you're a troll account.
My bad, carry on.
That's true but that doesn't mean that those two losses don't eat at DC's soul like small little roided termites in a wooden house.
If you think weight advantage isn't a variable in a fight then i can't help you.
[removed]
Who else was Stipe going to fight at the time?
There were zero legitimate contenders at heavyweight at the time the fight was booked.
Minus maybe Volkov.
Weight advantage is a thing and he cuts extreme weight and carries more than his opponents at 205 in the cage.
It's a variable in a fight and can make a bigger difference then you think.
[removed]
Nobody is saying that DC is the proverbial Jesse James.
They are saying that DC absolutely did not get the HW title “handed to him”.
If DC had never fought at HW I might be able to see your point.
However he was always a HW prior to LHW and only went down because Cain, his friend and training partner, was the champion.
Superfights never involve cleaning out the division the champ is going up or down to.
If you're going to bait, at least be competent at it

Throw in a "Joe Rogan agrees that weight cutting is just as bad or even worse than steroids" thing to really set people off.
DC was 13-0 at HW.
He only dropped down to avoid fighting his friend Cain for the title.
Then he wiped the floor with everyone at LHW.
Jones could only beat DC by using roids.
He is nothing without them.
Jon Jones cheats by dieting.
Handed the belt after beating the HW champion, ya goof

Edit: and i love that you are trying to downplay winning a belt in 2 seporate divisions by saying they are thin, how many guys can even get one title.
What did dc do that hurt you?
Lol.
Its not cheating tho.
[deleted]
DC cheats plenty too.
Did you just feel like you had too many karma points?
So is skill lol.
It makes you the killer of Jesse James......
Dude no matter how hard you hang off Jones' nuts, he's not going to share his coke and hookers and Soviet-era East German Swim Team steroids with you.
No.
He cheats by genetics bro.
Look at those arms and legs.
That wingspan is pretty blatant imo.
That same saying can apply to Jones.
I think his only fight clean was OSP and he looked very beatable.
Jones knew it so got back on gear.
Why do people never mention that Jones failed the post fight test for Dianobal?!
He cheated.
How do we know that without the steroids, hed be strong enough to defend DCs clinch and wrestling?
We don't.
Jesus you're salty.
[deleted]
Knocking out the guy with the most UFC heavyweight title defenses in history makes you the heavyweight champion, though.
He beat who was in front of him, passed all drug tests, won titles.
He is the real champ.
Thats how it works.
This narrative is so fucking stupid, since when does 50-45ing a guy make a dude look beatable?
The fuck?
Jon wrecked him and even broke his arm, he was fighting cautiously but still decimated him!
He had a change in opponent 2 weeks before the fight since DC fucking pulled out due to injury, and he hadn’t fought in a year and a half, but sure must have been the absence of roids that’s the reason he mopped he fucking floor with OSP.
Who was the rightful contender?
In the top ten for win streaks there was:

Derrick Lewis- 1 win

Curtis Blaydes- 5(technically 6) who wasn't/isn't ready yet

Alexander Volkov- 4 wins(only 1 against a top ten heavyweight)

Tai Tuivasa- 3 wins(2 nobodies and Arlovski a month before UFC225)

That's the entire top 10 at heavyweight not coming off a loss.
Now tell me which of them "deserved" the shot definitively.
So are height, weight, reach, skill set, talent, athletics, gameplan, coaching team, available video footage, and how a fighter is feeling on fight day.
You're splitting hairs.
Osp is a very flawed fighter.
No way he makes it past the second round with DC.
Osp wasn't wrecked at all.
He lost no doubt but it wasn't an ass whipping.
Decisionbot Jones OSP

EDIT: 50-44, 50-45, 50-45, the fuck does an asswhipping look like to you then if that doesn’t qualify??
This is equivalent to Khabib mauling dudes (in points) and winning by the very same points, Incase you forget, by all 3 judges’ scorecards, Jones won ALL 5 ROUNDS and one judge had him winning a 10-8, a fucking 10-8!
How the hell is that anything BUT an asswhipping?
when USADA wasn't even in the game yet...
I'm pretty inclined to believe someone is abusing PEDs their whole career when they've literally popped for them in 2 of the 3 USADA tested fights of their career, had someone recently say a coach at his gym was caught giving steroids to students at one point, had his "athletic freak family" brothers get caught using steroids, and had rumors his whole career he was using(see: hiding underneath the cage at Jacksons.)
Jon Jones is a steroid cheat and the only fight he has been clean was against OSP, which was a dogshit performance considering who well OSP has done in his other fights.

He beat a juicer.
He doesn't really need to improve on his shit talk.
He literally just needs to read out loud the headlines of the last few years of Jon Jones life.
That picture is dumb.
It's purposefully used to make it seem like Jon wasn't on steroids before, when that's just a terrible picture due to lighting, angle, bloat, whatever.
He has never looked like that in a single UFC fight and has always been muscular.
You also don't get the benefit of the doubt when you have so much evidence stacked against you, including failing 2 out of 3 times you've been legitimately tested.
[deleted]
No, it's not "just theories" that Jon Jones has failed two drug tests for PEDs, one of which being an anabolic steroid.
When you have that going against you, you get zero benefit of the doubt, and any supporting evidence is strengthened.
You posting random pictures saying you know when he started using is random theories.
[deleted]
That’s how the sport works.
Exactly, if PEDs didn’t make a huge difference then people wouldn’t risk losing it all to do them.
It’s night and day the difference of when your taking them .
.
It’s like when you talk to Baseball analysts, No one ever says Barry bonds is the GOAT, even tho his numbers would say other wise, Jones isn’t my GOAT.
He wouldn't have even been clean for that fight.
The only person handed undeserved title shots is Brock lmao.
You can downvote this guy all you want because some of you can not handle the truth.
I feel sorry for Cormier because when it comes to Jon Jones  he should shut his mouth off.
I am sick of Cormier, serious.
You leave my dad alone!
In the first round too, no less.
Looks like this ergo wanker character would have an argument with his own shadow smh.
&gt; Looks like this ergo wanker character would have an argument with his own shadow smh

And still lose it.
I'm amazed that people are still treating Jones wins like they're legit.
Come on guys, after you test positive *twice* for PEDs, your entire record should be fucking invalidated.
Just like Lance Armstrong, Barry Bonds, Marion Jones, the entire Russian Olympic team, etc.
None of their accomplishments mean anything anymore after they were caught for cheating.
Exactly.
I remember people saying "Jones is so strong.
Its crazy!"
when he slammed Hamill down and broke Matt's shoulder.
Or how easy he throws people  like they are 100lbs lighter.
There's your answer.
&gt; Yet Jones beat him twice.
And Lance Armstrong "won" 7 Tour De France titles.
Do you treat those as legit too?
You don't seem to learn anything, huh.
Jones beating DC for the belt didn’t make him the champion then?
Got it.
Disappointing troll.
DC can’t complain about roids.
He was pushing for this Brock fight!
!
He defended his 205 belt, it's legit, end of that story.
Right?
Took out a guy that took shots from Ngannou and pumped out a win.
Barry didn't test positive.
To be fair, indiscretions of an individual's family should never be held against the individual.
Soooooo JJ's 12 inch reach advantage isn't a real advantage?
solid logic.
I don't know why you guys keep excavating this salt mine.
Honestly, I'm at the point where I genuinely feel bad for Jon.
In a lot of ways he really does remind me of my mom, who passed away a few years ago after a long battle with drug addiction.
I see a lot of her in him when he goes into these single minded rants, and it really is painful to see from a human standpoint.
It's beyond obvious that Jones has an issue with substance abuse, but the narcissism is what gets me the most.
My mom's biggest hurdle- one she was never able to clear- was that she absolutely would not and could not acknowledge in any real sense that the damage she caused to friends, family, and strangers alike, was her fault.
There was zero ownership beyond the most cursory amends, and her attitude towards her guilt was basically to treat it all as if she'd been given a parking ticket.
"Yeah ok I might've done that, but YOU/THEY did this."
There was zero acknowledgement that something was very wrong and that it would get worse.
I don't know Jon, but knowing that he wrestles with addiction, it's easy to then start noticing everything that comes with it.
Addicts feel and act, almost to a man, that they are different or that they hide it better, but it's always the same shit.
The lies told and the excuses made.
In their minds they're the first to think of it, but they're never any different.
The justification is endless.
The narcissism exacerbates it.
It's the ouroboros- the snake eating its tail to sustain its life.
For my mom, it was the most sad, misplaced hatred of people who were better (had more money) than she.
For Jon, it honestly appears to be Daniel, or at least Daniel is the face given to whatever really drives it.
Perhaps it could be the fact that Daniel is or represents that which Jon has pretended so hard to be all these years, though I'm not qualified to do anything but speculate.
Jon is an immense, prodigious talent.
He has what so many of us might literally kill to be given, were it an option.
He has all of that, and yet this increasingly is the caveat- that he can't get out of his own way.
We selfishly get to see it as years we miss out on seeing his greatness at his sport, but for him this is genuinely something that, if you can't or won't TRULY get well, will absolutely destroy you and the relationships you hold dear.
I don't want to see Jon back in the octagon.
Not if he can't get truly healthy.
I say that as somebody who literally found the body of another who couldn't.
The pain is unreal, and even years on I still see its effects daily.
You can't serve two masters.
Training for a fight and truly getting well in your head and spirit cannot be accomplished simultaneously.
I'd much rather see a guy have a long, meaningful life with those he loves than I would watching them try to throw yet more stuff into the abyss.
This is beautiful man, I’m sorry for all that you’ve been through.
DC owns Jon Jones.
Who is so mentally defeated, so mentally weak, that they feel the only way they are able to succeed is to cheat and take PEDs?
DC or Jon Jones?
Lol who was the rightful contender then?
Until only a few months ago (well after the SF was made) HW was nearly as dead as LHW.
Both champs had cleaned out all worthy and available (remember Gus couldn't fight until well after this fight was made) challengers at the time, of all the SF to happen this one easily made the most sense.
What in your opinion were the correct title defences to be made for both men at the time?
From your post I can see you would have had a complex set of issues to deal with in your life.
Thanks for sharing this insight, and I hope you are well within yourself.
This post made my day.
I’m sorry for your hardship and loss but thank you for your honesty.
Such clarity of mind!
This is amazing.
I haven't seen someone downvoted so severely in such a long time.
A guy called "Fight Purist" defending a drug cheat...
[deleted]
I love how worked up you nerds get.
Jones &gt; DC.
That's because you guys are all casual followers.
How about people that actually won fights in the division?
Gustafsson and Blaydes were the correct defences, con't bother replying because there is no other correct answer.
The guy who knocked the other out and made him cry.
Do they measure reach and then allow the reach to grow bigger the next day?
Apparently i'm more aware and smarter than you are.
I do.
Until you can prove to me what difference the PED's actually make for him it's all assumption on your end.
He could be doing the same thing to DC on or off w/e.
Good to see some intelligence around here.
No, DC, Conor, GSP were all handed shots too.
How many of those things to they separate divisions for?
Exactly.
Try again.
Oh yes definitely, that's what I was thinking reading your trolling comments.
Blaydes and Gus.
Those were the deserved title shots.
You saying Blaydes isn't ready is laughable and don't give me any shit about rematches.
If you are up you are up and should get as many shots as you earn, it's the promotions job to bring in more fighters to be contenders.
No, he cuts extreme weight to be bigger than his opponents.
Lost twice and beat a much smaller fighter to win the title because Jones was suspended.
Kissed Dana's butt and got to move up and not earn the title shot but get 1 fighter with 1 style while every other fighter has to fight multiple fighters with multiple styles.
He was handed 2 belts that he never earned.
You don't know how much the PED helped him in the fight.
He may have very well performed exactly the same off it.
You are assuming that everything he is is due to a drug and that's lazy.
Yet he knocked out DC and made him cry.
Meaningless internet points?
Good luck achieving that worthless currency.
1 fighter with 1 style in a paper thin division.
Every other HW has to fight multiple fighters with multiple styles to move up the ladder.
He was handed the belt.
He also knocked out DC and made him cry.
Dc, Conor, and GSP were all champions in their respective weight classes pretty much having cleaned them out before getting title shots.
And they won.
So how isn’t it deserved if they ended up winning their title bouts after clearing out their divisions?
Nothing trolling about being honest and accurate.
This is extremely doubtful seeing as he kept cheating after being caught the first time.
Also, PEDs absolutely change the playing field.
You can gain strength easier, rest less, train longer.
So Im gonna say they 100% helped him because thats what PEDs are designed to do.
I have looked at your comments.
They are not the work of an honest person, nor are they accurate in their claims (I am referring strictly to the comments regarding DC, although a cursory glance at comments in other subs leads me to believe that I'd only find further support for my position).
You most certainly won't heed my advice, but I suggest you give it a rest already.
Your gimmick is tired.
I feel that, but fuck jon jones.
Cormier is smaller than some Middleweights and carries a lot of fat.
Your size argument is pretty void.
He beat the longest reigning UFC Heavyweight Champion without much difficulty.
He was handed nothing.
Im pretty sure you're just a Cormier hater.
Cormier was basically introduced to the MMA world by being an Alternate in the Strikeforce tournament and winning when nobody gave him a chance.
That man has earned everything.
Weird copypasta, but okay.
Except when your family has a history of PED failures.
It's stands to reason the common denominator is there family.
Yea...but fuck Jon Jones lol.
Also no other heavyweight was the lhw champ and no other heavyweight was deserving of a shot at the time, if you dont think dc is the real hw champ you are a dummy, and based on your other comment that has 150 downvotes, 150 other people also think you are a dummy.
[deleted]
If you think reach advantage or height advantage isn't a variable in a fight then I can't help you.
If you think taking PEDs isn't a variable in a fight then I can't help you.
You've already decided who to support and who to bash so there's obviously no changing your mind.
There it is.
He should do exactly that.
Throw in his family for bonus material.
"Arthur Jones, suspended for steroids" "Chandler Jones rushed to hospital after smoking synthetic marijuana".
Both his parents are/were extremely overweight and his mom died of diabetes.
There is CLEARLY a complete inability to be accountable in that family.
Gus was injured when they made the fight and hadn't fought in nearly a year, and Blaydes was coming off a snooze blanketing of Hunt.
Neither of those are suitable fights.
Unless you're so fundamentally opposed to super fights that you don't think they should ever happen I can't see your problem with DC and Stipe fighting each other.
This wasn't a Conor situation where there were rightful title shits for multiple people in both FTW and LW,  do you just think champs should never fight each other?
Rushing young contenders into title contention is how you ruin contenders.
Just look at what happened to Scott Jorgensen.
They rushed him into a title shot and he never recovered from the loss.
Going into the fight with Cruz he was 11-3.
After Cruz he went 4-8.
One of them.
You brought up one of the "factors", but you don't like that I brought up many of the other ones.
Yeah man, I love this Sub, I love MMA, and I love the Mods.
There are a lot of people here who are more knowledgeable about this sport than I am,  and I am learning a lot about the sport that I love so much, but also there are a lot of sheep.
You know people who just repeat stuff that they heard or they just follow what is popular for the sake of an upvote.
However you and I are different because we use logic instead of feeling.
I  can't wait until Jon Bones Jones GOAT comes back so he can make cry baby Cormier  go out of business.
When they start making divisions for your other factors then i'll take you seriously.
Weight is a much bigger factor than reach in an MMA fight.
Especially when we are talking about a dominant wrestler.
lol such a stupid fucking argument.
So a fighter isn't number 1 contender because you arbitrarily decide if they are ready or not??!!
You don't have a fucking clue whether he is ready or not.
Then explain Jones' dominance at 205lbs when the man cuts from like 218lbs.
Why Cain was champion at heavyweight, and beat Lesnar when he was outweighed by at least 40lbs on fight night.
Why Fedor had so much success at heavyweight at around 230lbs.
Why Frankie Edgar did so well at 155 and 145 despite cutting almost no meaningful weight.
I can go on if you want, but you get the point.
If not Gus then Latifi.
That's how it works.
Champ vs Champ is a lazy cash grab and it lets one champion jump the line which they should never do.
Those are all the same thing.
Doesn't change the fact that DC had an advantage and plenty of people in the industry agree and are aware of the reality.
A fighter isn't number 1 contender because he hadn't beaten anyone ranked highly enough to prove he was number 1 contender until he beat Overeem less than a month prior to DC fighting Stipe.
You're still not explaining **why** Blaydes is the clear cut #1 contender in this scenario, especially when his best win was 44 year old Mark Hunt who is 1-2 in the last 2 years, and may or may not be suffering the effects of CTE already.
You think that guy with 11 total fights is the clear cut #1 contender?
That's a stupid fucking argument.
All the same thing?
Those fighters all have different heights, weights, reaches, skillsets, etc etc etc.
Yet all of them were either typically undersized for their division, and did extremely well.
[removed]
[removed]
Did I dispute that?
All I'm saying is that Jones is a garbage human being and no matter how hard you stan for him online he won't ever acknowledge your existence.
Well given that the people all became commenting redditors I actually find this highly plausible

&amp;#x200B;
That’s the thing about PEDs (and umbrellas).
They always work.
Who was coming off a bad KO from Bader and then a fairly dull UD over Pedro at the time?
Do you really just think that the most deserving fighter in any division should get the shot even when they have shown very limited consistency or championship excellence?
If this were most other divisions i'd understand your viewpoint but in the 2 driest divisions in the UFC i just struggle to understand how you could be so outraged that Latifi didn't get a title shot off of a UD over Pedro, putting him on a 1 fight win streak.
I don't think any of the fighters even kicked up a fuss over the superfight because they all knew it was probably the fairest fight to make at the time.
&amp;#x200B;
You're a silly fuck that follows whatever the UFC presents you.
What i said is how it should be.
They don't always work.
PED users have been defeated MANY times.
50% in fact.
Do your research you casual noob.
You're a garbage human being for saying what you are saying.
Jones &gt; DC.
[removed]
Doesn't change the reality of what advantages exist.
Plenty of PED users have gotten their asses kicked in the octagon.
[removed]
Or maybe i just don't take issue with a champ jumping the non-existant line when they have no serious challengers in a weak division....?
Were the same situation to occur in FTW --&gt; LW then i would take issue etc.
Without simply asserting "that's how it should be", WHY do you think things should be that way?
A TRT bottle doesn't have a label that says "you will win fights."
lol nice troll pindick.
Nice garbage perspective.
Guaranteed you're a failure in life.
Exactly.
You don't take issue because you don't care about the sport.
You are selfish and don't know what's best for the product.
You're a selfish fan.
[removed]
So explain to me why this one instance is bad for the sport?
Were this the norm where champs just keep fighting each other, holding multiple belts and holding up divisions then I'd agree, but it's not and never will be because the UFC can see how that's fucked boxing as Dana has mentioned multiple times.
The control the UFC has over matchmaking compared to Boxing where it's very much fighters and their promotions in control of most things is a key difference.
So explain to me why this instance is making me a selfish fan and ruining the sport?
dude, seriously, jon jones is never going to be your friend

sorry, that's just the way it is.

lol.
You have such an adorable imagination in dealing with pointless internet arguments.
One thing is for sure, i'm better than you.
I don't care to talk to you anymore, you are naturally dumb and it serves zero purpose in explaining something to a casual fan that won't  be around in a few years.
[removed]
Your unwillingness to ever try and back up your opinions to anyone on this post alone - save calling people dumb and virgins - suggests you're either 12, Colby's alt account, or you lack the ability to properly justify your viewpoints and/or think critically about subjects.
It seems far more like you're projecting with all these Xbox live chat tier insults.
Anyhow, it's been real  fam.
Blah blah you are stupid and have nothing intelligent to say.

you're probably much better than I am at throwing racist slurs on xbox live as well, I'm terrible at that.

Summary: 
He should do exactly that.
I feel that, but fuck jon jones.
I have looked at your comments.
He could be doing the same thing to DC on or off w/e.
He is the real champ.
That same saying can apply to Jones.
He was handed the belt.
Jon Jones cheats by dieting.
Yet Jones beat him twice.
He was pushing for this Brock fight!
He wouldn't have even been clean for that fight.
I remember people saying "Jones is so strong.
DC was 13-0 at HW.
He can say he's the heavyweight champ.
He is nothing without them.
I feel like you don't actually watch fights.
Yea...but fuck Jon Jones lol.
How about people that actually won fights in the division?
You don't know how much the PED helped him in the fight.
I can go on if you want, but you get the point.
DC cheats by cutting so much weight.
He didn't clean out the HW division.
&gt; Yet Jones beat him twice.
Jones could only beat DC by using roids.
Jones beating DC for the belt didn’t make him the champion then?
I think his only fight clean was OSP and he looked very beatable.
He also knocked out DC and made him cry.
I love how worked up you nerds get.
Neither of those are suitable fights.
What did dc do that hurt you?
He was handed 2 belts that he never earned.
He's double champ of thin divisions.
Yet he knocked out DC and made him cry.
I don't want to see Jon back in the octagon.
Going into the fight with Cruz he was 11-3.
HW champ that was handed the belt by only having to beat 1 fighter.
It's a variable in a fight and can make a bigger difference then you think.
Those were the deserved title shots.
He beat the HW with the most title defenses of all time and never popped for PEDs like Jones did.
- **19/21** people scored it **50-45 Jones**.
- **1/21** people scored it **49-46 Jones**.
I am sick of Cormier, serious.
That's a stupid fucking argument.
He cheats by genetics bro.
Guy is undefeated at heavyweight.
He only dropped down to avoid fighting his friend Cain for the title.
It was a super fight, and not the first one ever.
If you think taking PEDs isn't a variable in a fight then I can't help you.
Jones knocked him out clean and made him cry by beating him for 5rds.
&gt; Yet Jones beat him twice

While cheating.
Making him cry and the knocking him clean out.
There's really nothing DC can say because Jones has owned him where it counts.
He was probably the most deserving of the shot regardless.
He has never looked like that in a single UFC fight and has always been muscular.
He beat who was in front of him, passed all drug tests, won titles.
