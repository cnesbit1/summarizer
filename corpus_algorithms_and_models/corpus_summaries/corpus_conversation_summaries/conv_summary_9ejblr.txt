Original Response: 
It seems to me like an all loving God would not manifest himself on earth and give undeniable proof, healing people, then ascending to the sky.
(John 21:25) tells us, "Jesus also did many other things.
If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written."
So Jesus gave a infinitesimal small percentage of humans guaranteed proof of gods existence.
The rest of us, well we just have to have "faith."
In a world where there are child rapists, countries get bombed to rubble, etc.
Oh btw if you don't have faith, well you just get to spend eternity in hell.
This does not sound like God.
How do Christians reconcile that their god is not a loving God?
(I consider a loving God one who loves his creation equally)

Summary: 
This does not sound like God.
