As a wife of a LEO, it seems to be a really common attitude among law enforcement.
Part of the issue stems from seeing the worst in people day after day and having coworkers who never got around to seeing the brighter side and are always cynical.
Part of it is that cops/deputies/etc.
are trained to be more cautious and wary of their surroundings which can lead some people to be really paranoid.
And then of course, there's media and half the country up in arms against you just for wearing a uniform.
That can be really exhausting and discouraging.
When my husband first started he was miserable and he certainly curses much more than he used to.
But he's in his 4th year now, and he's come around.
But it certainly took a lot of effort and self awareness on his part.
But without support and friendship, it would've been much harder.
We've had many heart-to-hearts about his attitude and how it affects me and what kind of stressors he deals with at work and how that affects him.
You could try having an open and honest conversation with your friend.
Clearly your friendship means a lot to you both and is worth fighting for.
But try to approach with compassion; getting mad about his attitude won't get you anywhere.
Try asking about his work and how he feels about it and go from there.
Supporting your friend through a rough change is the best you can do for him.
Hopefully, he'll come around.

I'm not arguing with you.
The problem goes in both directions.
Someone still has to do the job though, regardless of the sentiment.
And good cops still fall in the category of "all cops."
There are plenty of cops with good judgment, that haven't harmed any one.
But if you are doing your best and still receiving judgment for the actions of others, that can still be exhausting.
yeah "really," he chose to become a "b" and if he didn't know that going into it he didn't make an informed career choice.
His friend isn't responsible for that choice or its consequences and shouldn't subject himself to it if it's just becoming painful.
He can get a different job if it's so bad.

Sorry that my personal anecdote of losing 2 friends to a cultlike mindset based on their career choice and inability to see the other side from THEIR mindsets came off as ""political"" to you.

Just because a corrupt cop affected your life doesn't mean that all cops are evil or would act like that.
I lost a close family member due to a doctor's complete negligence and you don't see me going around hating all doctors.
The cops can police themselves.
That starts with say ... the nurse video in Utah when the jackass cope was way off the rails and several other police stood by and watched him.
They should have been ARRESTING him.
This happens every day.
Blue line dude.
ACAB until they start policing themselves - and I don't mean two months later when the video comes out.

Honestly, the best thing for everyone would be to throw out the entire institution of police and start over with a new law enforcement model.
This one isn’t working.
I mean, I would hope that you would hold police officers to a higher standard, since a police officer being reactionary can end in an unjustified killing.
Are you really trying to imply that being a cop is a safe job?
My worries about my boyfriend's safety are just as valid as parents' worries about their child's safety.

&gt; I mean, you just suggested her husband is a murderer.
I can see why she’s reacting how she is.
Keep it cool.
That was literally the point.
I borrowed her logic and spun it back on her to hopefully help her realize the issue with her comment.
Can you quote where I implied that being a police officer is a safe job?
No, I hold people who choose deadly professions to a higher standard.
If you don’t have the right temperament, get the fuck out of the force.

I can recognize the humanity of police officers and the imperfection of man, but still express the desire that we try to find police officers that are more temperamentally equipped to handle the unique stress that being a police officer carries.
I know that I don’t have the patience, the bravery, or the nerve to be a police officer.
I have no business being one, because I know I’d be prone to making rash decisions with unintended consequences.
It takes a special kind of person to be a good police officers, and not everyone who is currently a police officer is special.

Summary: 
The cops can police themselves.
