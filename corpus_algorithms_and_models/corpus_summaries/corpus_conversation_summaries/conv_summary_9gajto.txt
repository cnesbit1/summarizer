Original Response: 
The amount of solar panels required to meet 100% of our energy needs would cover a tiny fraction of the Earth's surface.
This particular effect would have no significant impact on the planet's heat budget, as opposed to the much greater effect of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

Okay then, how many square km?

According to a 20% efficiency for solar panels, and the usable power they would produce, compared against the 2017 figures for world energy consumption, I'm getting 38.76k km^2


Edit: Forgot to add the other "k" for thousand.

I don't think the problem was ever if the earth was big enough to be covered with solar panels, surely the problem is finite rare minerals, expensive production and expensive maintenance of those solar panels.
Solar is expensive compared with other renewables, and other forms of electricity generation generally.
No.
His agenda is steering the topic toward climate change - no answering questions.
Just as mine is being facetious.

1.
Silicon solar panels contain no rare minerals.
Older thin-film cadmium telluride (flexible solar) panels relied on a heavy metal *and* a rare earth element; this type of panel is nearing obsolescence.
Silicon solar panels are 100% recyclable and more material goes into making the glass than the cells themselves.
The chemicals used in production are overwhelmingly mundane and are literally the most used chemicals in the world.
Things like sulfuric/hydrochloric/phosphoric acids, lye, etc.
Literally *everything* involved one of those at one point.

Solar panels need no maintenance.
You can wash them off every once in a while but other than that they run 30+ years without even being looked at, so I have no idea where you got the idea that maintenance is expensive.
The whole point of solar is that the ongoing costs like fuel or maintenance are so close to zero as to be ignored completely.
Could we have one big set on panels in the south Sahara to power central Africa another set in north Sahara to power most of Europe?
Looks like there's plenty of space.
Imagine how little it'd be if they built one just for African needs!
Let's get started on it.
I realize the distances are quite large and quite a significant amount of electricity would be lost but hey, if we can sell Bay James electricity to Americans then certainly it can go great distances.
Theoretically:yes.
Practically:no.
The transmission/storage of that much energy takes a lot of realness and $.
It makes more sense to localize it to people's roofs and smaller setups close to our inside of the city they're powering.
Does this include energy storage and transmission?
So in every square mile we'd need like an 84x84 panel or so unless my math is way off.
That actually seems like quite a bit but I supposed to offer 100% of power needs it would work.
Even if we had a global transmission system and somehow overcame the political hurdles of countries not owning their own electricity generation, we would need a few of these around the world for 24/7 operation.
You are wildly misinformed.
Please don't go around spouting ignorance like you're knowledgeable about something when you haven't a clue what you're talking about.
Let's also remember the maintenance costs and production costs.
Nuclear would be a far greater option in all honesty.
Smaller foot print, there is an unlimited supply of uranium in the ocean, and the money saved from buying oil would cover the cost of building the required amount of nuclear power plants.
I dont think the sahara is a great place anyways, what with the fuckton of sand and dusr.
If we did ever go full solar, we'd probably do it at least partially using solar farms in orbit.

Solar panels need no maintenance.
