A summary of the argument in question:

\-&gt; there was a very fine margin for the physical constants of the universe's fundamental forces to allow for the existence of life

\-&gt; for such a finely tuned universe, you need someone who could finely tune it

\-&gt; that someone is god

Here's two words that refute this line of argumentation:

*Occam's Razor:*

&amp;#x200B;

To summarize it, the less assumptions a scenario makes, the more likely said scenario is.
&amp;#x200B;

An example:

Scenario 1: A cat falls from a roof by chance

Scenario 2: A cat is pushed, causing it to fall from a roof

&amp;#x200B;

As scenario 2 assumes that someone pushed the cat, it's more unlikely.
Hence, the cat falling from a roof, does not serve as evidence that the cat was pushed off it.
&amp;#x200B;

Let's apply this reasoning to the fine-tuning argument:

Scenario 1: The Universe comes into existence in a way that allows for life by chance

Scenario 2: An independent agent fine tunes the universe so that it comes into a way that allows life

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2 makes the assumption that an agent fine tuned the universe.
Hence this scenario is less likely than scenario 1 which makes no assumptions.
As the assertion of an independent agent makes this scenario unlikely, we can conclude that a finely tuned universe does not serve as evidence of a fine tuner's existence.
&amp;#x200B;

If you want to assert the use of an independent agent, you're gonna need to provide proof of its existence.

Summary: 
Hence this scenario is less likely than scenario 1 which makes no assumptions.
