Check with a vet for a micro chip,  call the lost pet hotline to report him found.
Post on Facebook in the rescues united 361, lost pets in corpus christi.
Also post on the news pages with the photo and your contact info.
A helpful plus would be to go to animal control and check their missing pet board to see if anyone has posted there.
Flyers posted at the vet offices could help also, but is dependent on how much you want to invest in the search.
Thanks for finding the little thing and keeping him safe!
We recently found a purebred catahoula puppy female that had a slit open throat and was severely emaciated.
They estimated her at 8 months and was only 18.7lbs when we took her in to the emergency vet.
No one ever came forward to claim her,  but the vet believes it's due to the gross negligence they would have to answer for if they did.
She's our foster until she's fixed and we find a safe home.
It's not easy,  but well worth it if you can make a difference to these little fuzz balls.

Summary: 
Thanks for finding the little thing and keeping him safe!
