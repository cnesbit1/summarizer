Original Response: 
The real insanity is you chose to use a bread knife to cut up strawberries!
Classic Jack.
Serrated works best on strawberries, just as it does on tomatoes.
I use a sharp steak knife (victorinox)

Also at $5 a tray that’s a tiny risk.
I’d take it, even if I had to push them through a sieve and make jam.
See I find the serrations tear the flesh of softer fruit where the skin has some natural texture, and the size of that bread knife would be overly cumbersome.
A sharp paring knife would keep the cuts nice and clean.
But you’re right, hell for $5 a tray I’d put them in the bath and swim around in them!
He might has to saw through needles.
I have that same knife.
Just wanted to say.
Serrated is not best for tomatoes.
The serrations would just tear the tomato.
The best is a good sharp knife.
If your non-serrated knife can't cut a tomato, then it's probably cheap junk that should be thrown away.
&gt; then it's probably ~~cheap junk that should be thrown away~~ time to hone it.
Not all knives can be honed.
Cheap knifes are often just cut from a sheet of metal and grinded, and they're too soft to stay sharp.
Serrated is great for tomatoes when you consider the average person.
Most people do not have good knives, and a serrated steak knife will do a better job than your average person's blunt knife ever will.
A mediocre sharp knife vs any old serrated knife.
Yeah the serrated knife wins.
An actually sharpened knife though, will do such a better job.
Source: got off my lazy ass and finally sharpened my supermarket bought knives.
You don’t need good knives though just to sharpen the thing.
It won’t hold forever but I can get a pretty razr edge on my ikea knives with a really cheap whetstone.
Sharpen not hone if it’s that bad.
Or it just needs sharpening.
There's no beating edge retention on good knives but even junk ones can get pretty sharp.
That's true to an extent.
You can sharpen any knife... but cheap knives are soft and as you said, will not hold their edge.
The amount of time and effort that goes into constantly sharpen a knife like that is simply not worthwhile for most people.
I personally use whetstones all the time and love them.
But do you really think the average person is going to be using one?
I don't think so.
They'd more likely use something like [this](https://www.officeworks.com.au/shop/officeworks/p/anysharp-classic-knife-sharpener-anysharp?cm_mmc=Google:SEM:Shopping:Kitchen%20Utensils:ANYSHARP&amp;cm_mmca1=NULL&amp;cm_mmca3=conversion&amp;cm_mmca9=columbus&amp;CAWELAID=620015440002868846&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=61711999354&amp;CATCI=pla-295996781749&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMInO2vqtK53QIVBqmWCh32Aw2-EAQYASABEgIDKvD_BwE)... which don't do a very good job.
Why not just whip out a serrated knife save the trouble?
OP has the right idea with a bread knife.

Summary: 
I have that same knife.
Serrated is not best for tomatoes.
The best is a good sharp knife.
Yeah the serrated knife wins.
Not all knives can be honed.
