Original Response: 
I'd like to start by saying I've been having this argument with myself for quite a while now.
I was raised Hindu and I don't know how else to pose this question other than why is religion so important.
Why is the culture and the mindset around religion so powerful that makes people want to hurt each other?
I know that many religions claim and preach that none of their followers should hurt anyone, yet more times than not we find ways to manipulate words to justify our actions.
Examples of these kind of people are splattered throughout the history of religion, and yet regardless of how many horrible things that are done - these people are forgotten.
Their actions are categorized under those of an extremist and labeled has unique one off events, but they keep happening over and over again.
I know I'm over generalizing this question and making it seem like religion only does horrible things - but doing a good act to hide a bad one doesn't make it right.
There's lot more that I'd like to elaborate on but I think I'll end it here.
I want to keep the conversation that come from this post open-ended.
Thank you.
