Original Response: 
I'm not even vegan but I try to purchase from the vegan section when I can for 3 reasons:



1.
You can't feed 7B people on an 'American' animal-based diet.
Eventually we'll have to switch to something else because dairy, poultry, meet, pork will be too expensive.
2.
The more we consume vegan foods, the cheaper (and better tasting) they get for everyone.
It's like voting with your wallet for sustainable, cruelty-free foods to succeed.
3.
It's healthier and easier to digest.
It's like renewables 8-10 years ago.
Someone had to start using them when they weren't the cheapest, cleanest and most accessible source of energy (thanks Germany).
They now are incredibly competitive.
Nice assumptions bro

Edit: vegan is a religion.
I love people who think like this.
Good on you.
Ironically because Americans are so fat and traditionally with unhealthy diets, it’s caused Americans to also be very educated on health beyond anywhere else I’ve ever seen.
When I lived years in Europe while everyone was generally healthier I don’t think I met people who understood the science and reasonings as well as Americans do.
People in america have to deal with so much garbage that those who want to be healthy have to get far more educated.
I think that’s what’s fueling this vegan rise.
It’s not so much because Americans like less meat but because Americans want to be healthier and are more confident with vegan product marketing claims.
And remember, you can mix and match too!
I don’t think I could ever go *full* vegan, but that doesn’t mean I can’t have it once in a while.
If you’re in my boat, try having a vegan meal once a week, and see how that goes!
You’ll still be making positive changes, without having to give up on your eating habits.
Also from that same backdrop, I think it causes people to conflate the inherent healthiness of the diet (say, avoiding animal products or meat) with the effect of having to be so thoughtful of what you eat.
A non-vegan, non-vegetarian who took as much time to read and understand the ingredients of their food as a vegan or somebody who avoids gluten has to would generally see similarly substantial positive health effects.
So, when people say that being vegan or vegetarian is inherently the slightest bit more healthy, I think it has to be noted that that's the primary reason why; it's not that you're vegan, it's that you're closer to understanding the origin of all of the things you eat and that can help you avoid excesses or lapses you don't even realize are happening.
I had somebody in my house be put on an elimination diet by their allergist.
You start by eliminating all of the major culprits from your diet and gradually reintroduce them to find the one(s) that's causing your problem.
So, it started with totally avoiding: dairy, gluten, soy, artificial, preservatives, artificial coloring, filler in things like ground meat, shellfish, nuts and more.
We had to thoroughly read every ingredients list.
We had to learn what a lot of the things we didn't know were.
We had to ask weird questions ("is a coconut a nut?").
We realized things we didn't know about what was in a lot of our food.
Even though we could still eat garbage throughout that whole process, the fact that we had to read every ingredients list and every "may contain" permanently changed the way we ate, even though the process is over and now we can eat basically all of those things.
&gt; You can't feed 7B people on an 'American' animal-based diet.
Eventually we'll have to switch to something else because dairy, poultry, meet, pork will be too expensive.
I don't think there's any conclusive reasons on why this is the case.
The population isn't fixed at 7 billion people with x amount of production in the world.
As economies develop, what they are able to produce and how much they produce will also increase.
For example, China is trying to modernize farming and ranching to increase pork productivity because farmers are still using old fashioned methods that are unable to keep up with increases in demand.
Once production is modernized, demand for imported pork is expected to fall and prices will drop back down.
Coupled with the fact that we know that people in developed nations reproduce at lower rates than developing nations, there's a case to be made that as countries become wealthier and more able to afford meat and other animal byproducts, their populations will also be increasing at a slower rate before being even or decreasing.
I think the premise of this kind of thinking is flawed like most Malthusianism notions because it's based on the idea that the population will always keep growing and never decrease and that production is linear and unable to scale with innovations.
I personally don't believe the cost of animal-based products will ever reach a point where it's prohibitively expensive.
If the cost of feed becomes too expensive because we run out of arable land, it'd become more cost-efficient to produce grains in area-dense facilities like the Netherlands or Japan.
Again, if we're at the apex of efficiency in our practices today and this is as good as it is ever going to get, I'd agree with you that this is unsustainable.
But the fact of the matter is that our productivity will continue to grow as demand grows, and every doom and gloom scenario in the past has failed to account for this.
Yeah except your premise is flawed because for example there is no dietary cholesterol in plant-based diets.
Make it taste better than meat, be healthier, and cost effective, and meat will be doomed.
A lot of meat substitutes these days are already pretty good, and I've significantly reduced my meat consumption in the last 5 years.
However I think vegan/vegetarian substitutes need to be more competitive on price to really overtake meat, because you can get actual meat for cheaper than the substitutes in many cases, especially the high quality substitutes.
They will eventually get there, I think.
&gt;  It’s not so much because Americans like less meat but because Americans want to be healthier and are more confident with vegan product marketing claims.
It is nothing to do with America...
The same thing can be seen in the UK and it is little to do with trends in the general populace.
The vast majority of the change is caused by one subset of society, educated millennial women.
I agree.
For instance there can be endless debate on the paleo diet.
If you go down that path you WILL become more healthy.
No whether or not cutting out butter is necessary is sort of besides the point.
It puts people on a path the be very observant and aware of what they are eating and what’s in their food.
It forces people to cook their own food and become very aware of everything they are eating.
Same with going gluten free.
Is it necessary?
What’s the degree difference between allergy and sensitivity?
Who knows.
But at the end of the day, just like the paleo diet, people end up being much healthier and aware of what they eat and how it impacts their body.
People in places like France and Italy don’t need to do things like this.
Their food is very established, fresh, and not processed.
Which is why if there is the rare chance I met someone out there on the keto diet they wouldn’t even know the science behind it.
Their knowledge would be limited to “I just know it makes me feel good and helps me with sports”.
&gt; there is no dietary cholesterol in plant-based diets

“Since cholesterol comes only from animal foods, vegan diets are, by definition, cholesterol-free.
Even though cholesterol is a vital component of every human cell, vegans do not need to worry about not getting enough cholesterol, because the body can make all the cholesterol it needs from non-animal foods.”

http://www.diagnosisdiet.com/diet/vegan-diets/
&gt; Yeah except your premise is flawed because for example there is no dietary cholesterol in plant-based diets

But dietary cholesterol isn't inherently bad.
For example, Colorado State University extension [says](http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/nutrition-food-safety-health/dietary-fat-and-cholesterol-9-319/):

&gt; In healthy amounts, fat and cholesterol help our bodies function properly.
&gt; .
.
.
&gt; While the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended limiting consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day, this recommendation is not included in the updated 2015-2020 edition of the Dietary Guidelines.
This change reflects new research that suggests that dietary cholesterol, consumed in moderate amounts, does not affect health risks, including heart disease, for the majority of people unless a person has diabetes.
&gt; .
.
.
&gt; Keep in mind, however, that dietary cholesterol does not have as much of an effect on blood cholesterol as saturated fat.
So:

1.
The thing that they say has the bigger impact on cholesterol (saturated fat) is available as an option when people form their diet regardless of whether they are vegan or not.
2.
People who do consume dietary cholesterol don't inherently have any increased risk at all for negative outcomes.
There is literally nothing in the world that is okay in all amounts.
Our problem is always that we consume too much of something (often without realizing it), not that we consume it at all.
This is why, as my original point stated, making an effort to be thoughtful and informed of what is in what we eat is generally the important part.
Often times, people consume excesses of things (ex: sodium, sugar, saturated fat) not only because they lack self-control but because they have no concept of how much of those things are in everything they eat.
As you start to have to look at the label or recipe for everything you eat, it starts to become much more obvious even to the layperson when you're eating an excessive amount of something.
In the end, whether you are a vegan, vegetarian or an omnivore, it is easy to eat in a way that will likely cause health problems and it is easy to eat in a way that likely will not cause health problems.
But in the end, being aware of the contents of everything you eat (which is more likely to be the case if you choose to eliminate something like animal products from your diet), regardless of why, is a really good first step toward people realizing imbalances and therefore approaching a healthier balance.
&gt; It's healthier and easier to digest.
Studies on vegetarians show no meaningful difference in mortality ([Kwok, 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149402)).
Digestibility of animal sources are generally higher due to various anti-nutrient factors in plants ([Sarwar Gilani, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107545)).
It is not easy to accidentally get saturated fat in a plant-based diet.
I use coconut MCT oil to get some saturated fat, but it doesn’t appear accidentally.
There is no doubt that non-vegan diets generally contain MUCH more saturated fat than vegan diets.
Putting that aside, you haven’t seemed to consider the fact that a non-vegan diet means that you’re taking away the life and liberty of other sentient beings.
Do you think it is important to also be thoughtful and informed about that?
&gt; You can't feed 7B people on an 'American' animal-based diet.
but we are...
No we are not.
https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets.
Nice confirmation bias you've got there.
You can also find studies showing that climate change is a myth, but overwhelming majority of evidence points the other way.
https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/becoming-a-vegetarian.
I love burgers, but don't eat them unless I'm out because I know they're not very good for you.
Until HEB started stocking Beyond Meat burgers.
Now I eat them at home at least once a week.
There's actual evidence that this is the case.
https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets.
The reason I use the word "inherently" is to get around the very biases that I mentioned initially.
If the population of vegans is biased in some way compared to the population of omnivores for some reason, like due to the fact that they have to read the labels and due to the selection bias that they are almost all a subset of people who demonstrated the willpower to go against the grain with their dietary choices, then trends in what they consume will exist that are explained by those biases rather than the overarching dietary rules.
Advocating for those biases in non-vegans could then lead to similar effects even without a vegan diet.
In other words, I'm not arguing whether on the whole omnivores are more likely to make certain dietary mistakes than vegans because that's an argument about demographics more than the merits of the rules that define the diet given the above and given the enormous variety of diets that can fit into those two labels.
A vegan might eat fried dough and candy all day or they might eat a diverse, balanced diet in moderation.
An omnivore might eat pork rinds and corned beef flat all day or they might eat a diverse, balanced diet in moderation.
The scientific data suggests that one can construct healthy and unhealthy diets under both categories and that true indicators of healthy diet are going to be moderation and diversity, so that's what, in the context of health, we need to advocate for.
&gt; Putting that aside, you haven’t seemed to consider the fact that a non-vegan diet means that you’re taking away the life and liberty of other sentient beings.
Yup.
Because the topic is not whether one should be vegan.
Veganism isn’t strictly a diet, it’s a moral philosophy and way of living.
Maybe you mean plant-based diet?
Again, this kind of analysis simply projects outwards by assuming constants like the fact land is a fixed constant.
It doesn't take into account the possibility, say, that you could have a 5-story facility growing corn for feed so that you get 5x the produce yield from a single acre and reduce the growing cycle.
The reason why we don't do this kind of densely consolidated agriculture is that arable land is not a limiting constraint yet.
It's like someone saying in the 1800's that New York City could never house 8 million+ people, because they're ignoring the possibility of apartments and condos building upwards and projecting that every square foot of land will be used to build houses based on 1800 practices.
Oxford dictionary lists "diet" as meaning "the kinds of food that a person, animal, or community habitually eats" and its example sentence/phrase is "a vegetarian diet".
It's normal and common English usage to precede the word "diet" with an adjective describing a group of people or philosophy in the same way that we can say "the Mayan calendar" even though "Mayan" doesn't strictly mean calendar.
That's how adjectives work.
Saying "a vegan diet" doesn't make any claim on the breadth of the word "vegan" means, it just sets that as the context by which people understand the kind of diets we're talking about.
When I say a vegan diet, it's completely clear especially in the context of this conversation, what I mean.
And I think it's pedantic and not productive to suggest that any real improper communication happened there.
At best, "plant-based" conveys the exact same situation.
Meanwhile, if the audience is as pedantic as you're being about the phrase "vegan diet" they might even yell at me about vegans eating fungi (ex: mushrooms, yeast), minerals (ex: salt), etc.
Or they might start mentioning the thought experiments that allow a person of the vegan philosophy to have something identical in makeup to an animal product without coming from an animal.
In the end, I think it's easiest and most accurate and correct to say "vegan diet".
If you’re going to insist on using the word vegan, don’t act surprised when someone brings up the ethical considerations.
Any kind of forecast analysis needs a base and variables to modify for future projections.
That's obvious.
In your case, you're just making shit up and 'forecasting' that in 10 years time we've solved every major issue with industrial livestock production: from CO2 emissions, to land, antibiotic and water issues.
Your argument is more akin to people who continue smoking with the argument that concerned family members are not considering the declining costs of lung transplants, the development of lab-grown organs or the improvement in cancer treatments.
Sure, they're technically correct, but they're also idiots because they have no way of knowing if the solution will come before their death.
I'm not making any claim here.
You're the one that proposed the claim that we can't feed the global population given continued growth, the burden of proof is on your end to prove this claim.
I am refuting your limitations based on the existence of alternatives to current practices.
Saying that industrial dense indoor agriculture exists is not the same thing as it being a viable and replacement to current agriculture practices in 10 years, I don't foresee the global demand necessitating this for another century.
Your forecasting is not taking into account costs, productivity, or anything remotely realistic, it's just drawing a straight line forward based on a regression which is incredibly inaccurate.
Case in point again, if someone did this same kind of analysis back in the 1800's, NYC would not be able to support 1/10th of the current population that it ended up being able to.
Regardless of whether we're talking about vegans, Romanians or grandpas, if the conversation is about whether or why a certain set of people have certain health outcomes, I will be "surprised" if they then change the topic to whether those people are morally good which has nothing to do with the topic being discussed.
Interesting, I find American's are far more susceptible to fall for misinformation.
That’s probably a bias because America dominates western online spaces, media, and entertainment.
Living in Germany I can’t even tell you how many people are afraid of GMO and are into woo cures.
Because you are implicitly arguing against veganism it is appropriate to bring up the moral question.
&gt; the burden of proof is on your end to prove this claim

Based on currently available information and known technologies, the evidence is already on his side.
You are the one introducing hypotheticals and hand-waving technology to undercut the argument, which means the burden of proof is on you to prove why that kind of speculation is more convincing than the best analysis of today.
Yeah I have found German's and Scandinavian's tend to have a weird balance between genius and wacky.
The link I posted is a systematic review looking at all the available observational studies on vegetarians.
If you think the "overwhelming majority of evidence" shows otherwise please post a meta-analysis or systematic review supporting that.
Your link only focused on mortality from cardiovascular studies (and it actually states that there is modest improvement with a vegetarian diet) hence the selection and confirmation bias.
You chose cardiovascular mortality as the only variable to dictate whether a vegetarian diet is healthier.
That's bad science.
The link I posted analyzes other diseases such as diabetes and cancer where a vegetarian diet improves outcomes.
&gt; Your link only focused on mortality from cardiovascular studies (and it actually states that there is modest improvement with a vegetarian diet) hence the selection and confirmation bias.

&gt; The link I posted analyzes other diseases such as diabetes and cancer where a vegetarian diet improves outcomes.

The only evidence provided from the link is purely backwards looking data, which again, only looks at current state and projects forward using it.
The validity of forecasting with a static model on something that is dynamic is extremely flawed, which is why I've stated and will re-state that this is the same kind of flawed logic Thomas Malthus based his reasoning on.
We've already been down this exact some path with Malthusian theory and we know that this flawed analysis doesn't work, to say that this suffices for evidence is irrational.
[Technology that I'm referring to exists and works.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUmP8Tli-Mc) The reason why you don't see it widely used in countries like the US, is because there's literally no reason to when land scarcity is not a thing.
no idea what if any effect it'll have.
but we have the lab grown meat underway.
Providing it becomes fully realized, it might mean that people get to enjoy meat at least a bit more than if we didn't have that technology.
I didn't argue against veganism and explicitly said things like "the topic is not whether one should be vegan."
Having less (or none) children would do more to reduce the consumption of animal products, than going vegan.
Why is it important to you to make the point that a carnist diet can be just as healthy as a vegan diet, and that the reason vegans are healthier is simply because they are more ingredient-aware?
The comments before me mentioned both (1) the perception that eating vegan is healthier and (2) the level of information among consumers of what they're eating.
So, I built on that conversation by talking about why I think the latter generalizes to explain both the former and many other high-information scenarios.
&gt; Atherosclerosis affects only herbivores.
Dogs, cats, tigers, and lions can be saturated with fat and cholesterol, and atherosclerotic plaques do not develop (1, 2).
The only way to produce atherosclerosis in a carnivore is to take out the thyroid gland; then, for some reason, saturated fat and cholesterol have the same effect as in herbivores.
&gt; &gt; Although most of us conduct our lives as omnivores, in that we eat flesh as well as vegetables and fruits, human beings have characteristics of herbivores, not carnivores (2).
The appendages of carnivores are claws; those of herbivores are hands or hooves.
The teeth of carnivores are sharp; those of herbivores are mainly flat (for grinding).
The intestinal tract of carnivores is short (3 times body length); that of herbivores, long (12 times body length).
Body cooling of carnivores is done by panting; herbivores, by sweating.
Carnivores drink fluids by lapping; herbivores, by sipping.
Carnivores produce their own vitamin C, whereas herbivores obtain it from their diet.
Thus, humans have characteristics of herbivores, not carnivores.

Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans.
What does this mean?
This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans.
In other words, there is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer.
The evaluation is usually based on epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed humans.
&gt; In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer.
&gt; 7.
Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans.
What does this mean exactly?
In the case of red meat, the classification is based on limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as well as strong mechanistic evidence.

You can feed people.
If we didn't throw out nearly half of food bought.
Not on an American diet.
Too much meat that require too much water and land.
Thank you.
I love HEB!
Howdy neighbor!
All I said was that you can't feed 7B people on an American diet.
That's today.
That's true.
Then you put on your "smart cap"	and presented no evidence, trends or actual forecast whatsoever and said that in the future new technology will save us.
It might.
But then again it might not.
We might solve land issues.
But we still have issues with water, fertilizer, antibiotics and CO2/CH4 emissions.
By the time livestock is expensive enough that we require vertical farming to grow feed, we probably ruined the planet already with emissions.
Point is, we can't feed 7B people on a heavily meat-based diet with current infrastructure and technology and without sacrificing the future to global warming.
We can feed everyone on the planet a healthy diet with current agricultural yield and infrastructure.
We can't feed everyone if we use that to feed livestock.
What the future holds is anybody's guess.
You're very free to keep screwing the planet betting on future technology to save us all.
Based on your comments I wouldn't expect or even ask much of you anyways.
It’s more about how modern meat production is already destroying the environment, and that cost isn’t baked into the price of the meat.
Turning resources into animals at massive scale can only be made so efficient.
You’re attempting to refute the claim backed up by actual data by suggesting that we’re going to invent our way out of the problem.
Maybe that will happen, but until that breakthrough is made, you kind of have to go on reality as it is currently.
Do you really think that the American diet is what’s consumed by the vast majority of humans on earth?
Having been in the vegan space for a while, I have not seen women outnumber men at any of the events I've been to.
I love this.
Been vegan for 11 years and the choices we have now would’ve been but a dream in my first year.
Does one preclude the other?
Why not both?
The American diet is junk food and carbs not nearly as much meat as it should be.
My ancestors ate only meat year round, for 1300 years even till mid 20th century before communists took over and fucked everything up and the country is not that big and 1/3 or more mountains.
There's plenty of nice land for cows sheep and pigs in America.
It's hard, price wise, as meat is so heavily subsidized.
But this also might change in the future....so it'll get there, I agree.
&gt;educated

&gt;Promoting gluten free 

Unless you are promoting the diet to someone with Celiac's, educated and gluten-free are mutually exclusive.
Especially the second one for me.
5 years ago I thought veganism was silly, now I understand its justification and agree with the underlying ideas.
I still eat meat for a few reasons but I’m looking forward to the day where it’s easier for me to say I’m vegan.
My place of work randomly got shipped a case of beyond meat burgers and they are *so incredibly good*.
They didn’t end up getting used so I took some home instead of letting them throw them out.
&gt; All I said was that you can't feed 7B people on an American diet.
That's today.
That's true.
Either you look at today with current consumption + production, or you look at the future and scale up production accordingly.
You can't create a hypothetical scenario where you suddenly have 7B people consuming like Americans without any change in production.
You have to adjust both sides of the equation, otherwise you're just conveniently creating a scenario that fits your narrative.
&gt; It might.
But then again it might not.
We might solve land issues.
But we still have issues with water, fertilizer, antibiotics and CO2/CH4 emissions

So lets tackle this in two parts.
The first is water scarcity.
If water scarcity reaches a point where it becomes a resource constraint, then water desalinization will become cost effective.
Whether or not this water treatment process will still be prohibitively high is unknown.
If we manage to become more efficient, the cost might be lowered and the price impact on commodities that use water as part of production might be minimal or significant.
This is the unknown part, but the means of producing the quantity is there.
In regards to antibiotic resistance, this is an issue that we're facing regardless and has no relation to scaling of production.
Whether we stop increasing production and keeping at 2018 levels or scale it as demand increases, antibiotic resistance is an issue that society as a whole has to deal with regardless and increased production doesn't exacerbate the situation.
When it comes to CO2 emissions, you're going to need to be more concrete.
Now we're no longer looking at feasibility based on resource constraints, you're looking at an issue of how much can we push the planet's limits.
My concern here is that you're using hyperbolic and intangible language here.
My definition of "ruining the planet" and your definition of "ruining the planet" may vary drastically.
For example, I have no qualms with shorelines disappearing and thousands of species of animals going extinct in the wild, but you might consider that "ruined".
My idea of ruined would be the planet's temperature reaching a point where it becomes inhospitable for human beings even with man-made adaptions, which is probably much further along than your definition.
If we look at the world as something to optimize, the end goal should be to create something that is ultimately sustainable.
The question now is how you balance the short and long run.
If you only focus on the short-run, then the easiest solution is to shut down every factory, every vehicle, and mandate birth control.
However, by limiting the resources you have and the population size, you're limiting the pool of scientific and engineering talent possible of making progress on solutions to, say, cold-fusion or a similar technology that could solve our energy needs.
The opposite would be to allow countries like India and China to use cheap and polluting technologies to power their country and enable their economic development.
This would allow their population to continue to grow and develop, and add a ton of scientists to the global population which contributes towards improving efficiencies and work on sustainable solutions.
The question is which one is more effective in the long-term.
Will we reach cold-fusion faster by capping current carbon emissions and progressing at current pace, or by allowing carbon emissions and also increasing the pace of research?
I'm more inclined to believe in the latter.
&gt; You're very free to keep screwing the planet betting on future technology to save us all.
Based on your comments I wouldn't expect or even ask much of you anyways.
You're committing the logical fallacy of the chicken or the egg.
You're saying that because we don't have the technology currently, we are unable to have it in the future.
My rebuttal would be that we don't have the technology currently because there's no need for it.
Humans are for the most part rational decision makers.
It's unrealistic and contrary to human nature for us to all cut consumption and wait until technology has enabled us to consume in a sustainable manner.
For example, if you outlaw beef in all forms today until it has been deemed sustainable, you'll raise 1-2 generations of people that never tasted beef and thus decrease the demand for beef to a non-significant level.
Without a demand for beef, there's little incentive to make process on improving ranching efficiencies.
The flip-side would be to allow people to consume and people will have to innovate to meet the demands, which creates the incentive for the technological progress to be made.
The former is predicated on the assumption humans will altruistically develop technology for something they have no interest in, the latter is based on the assumption humans will develop technology that they benefit from.
If I was a betting man, I'd pick the latter 100% of the time because it properly aligns incentives.
Compromising our diets to solve the problem of climate change is a lazy solution, just like saying abstinence is the solution to society's problems with STD's.
You're ignoring alternatives and solutions that exist like contraception and medication in favor of the simplest solution that comes at the expense of satisfaction and warping of human nature.
&gt; You’re attempting to refute the claim backed up by actual data 

Lets break this down because I'm not sure you understand how data works.
I don't disagree with the existence of the data itself, I'm sure they did their due diligence in gathering the data.
My concern is with how they're using the data.
In a hyperbolic example to make a point, it's like if someone told you they gathered the data of 100 coin tosses and it came out 60 heads and 40 tails, therefore the 101st coin toss MUST BE HEADS.
Wait, that makes no sense.
This is the kind of problem I have with the link, it's lazy regression without adapting the model.
As someone who works with forecasting professionally, it's incredibly misleading and inaccurate.
So when you say "actual data", I disagree, because the data itself is neutral, the analysis is rubbish.
You're going to need to use more precise language and points if you want to talk about meat production's impact on the environment.
Yes, these are complex topics that span from land &amp; water constraints, sulfur and nitrate degradation and scarcity, to greenhouse gases.
Each of these issues can be tackled on an individual level, just like how a surgeon can mend individual bones if someone has injured their arm and hand.
What people are proposing here is equivalent to "just amputate the whole damn arm."
Would it work?
Probably yeah, if we just outlawed and enforced the ban on beef, pork, and poultry overnight.
But the issue is that it's an excessive solution to a problem that can be approached at the tactical level.
This is why language like "destroying the environment" is not very productive, because you're jumping to the conclusion that there's only one solution which is the nuclear option in every case.
I will say I never thought I could go vegan.
I yoyoed between Omni and vegetarian for years.
Then I did and it was fucking simple.
It seems like a big deal before you do it but then really normal once you do it.
I don’t miss anything and I’d never go back just based on health benefits alone.
Vegetarian keeps dairy which is like the worst stuff.
To anyone who sees this: seek out buy and try a Beyond Sausage brat with all the fixings on a pretzel bun.
My point was that ignoring a common ingredient, whether rationally or not, forces you to be more aware of everything that you are eating, which is a major factor in whether you eat healthy.
That awareness is what I mean by being "educated".
They are educated by having to read and comprehend every ingredient list and ask questions to every chef and that makes them educated about what they're eating regardless of whether the underlying reasoning (e.g.
avoiding meat, avoiding gluten) is sound or not.
But also, your black and white stance against the possibility that anything but celiac's can make gluten problematic is as irrational as the people who insist that all/most/many people should avoid gluten.
Yes, gluten isn't an inherently unhealthy food.
Yes, many/most people who say they are gluten intolerant aren't.
However, non-Celiac's gluten intolerance/sensitivity is a thing.
[[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561414002180)][[2](https://journals.lww.com/jcge/Abstract/2012/09000/Serological_Tests_in_Gluten_Sensitivity__Nonceliac.13.aspx)][[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12016-010-8223-1)][[4](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0148607111426276)] Avoiding gluten may produce tangible positive results even if gluten isn't the actual reason.
[[1](https://www.vox.com/2017/11/21/16643816/gluten-bloated-carb-wheat-fructan-problem-fodmaps)][[2](https://journals.lww.com/co-allergy/Abstract/2009/06000/Wheat_allergy.12.aspx)][[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0148607111426276)] Those results may be due to widespread, well-understood matters or they may be due to something particular to one individual and their genetics, allergies, gut bacteria, etc.
In the end, all of the people in these categories are harmed enormously by people like you who, despite scientific consensus, try to "educate" the public that Celiac's is the only valid reason to avoid gluten.
In the end, the main message to pound home is that gluten is not bad for humans and stomach problems after consuming gluten might just be because it's dumb to eat a whole bucket of pasta at once, but that there are a handful rare, but valid reasons  why a person might want to reduce or avoid gluten and those reasons should be ultimately discovered with one's doctor.
Unlike arm amputation, slowing the production of meat until we can produce it responsibly and ethically is not a one-way door.
It’s reversible.
Poor analogy.
This might sound a bit rude, but it's not meant as an insult: the studies are cherry picked and mostly looking at isolated biomarkers.
I've linked some systematic reviews where available and tried to expand on the actual issues where possible.
**CANCER**:

&gt; [Adolescents who consume dairy have a 3x increased risk of advanced prostate cancer.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249408/pdf/kwr289.pdf)

Observational study in a subgroup of Icelandic males (n=2,268), specifically results were statistically significant only in those born before 1920 so it's even less than that.
These result doesn't show up in large scale observational studies which is why I linked a systematic review (n=72,598) ([Kwok, 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149402)).
&gt; [The protein in animal foods raises IGF-1 hormone levels, which cancers feed on.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16684388)

Cancers doesn't feed on IGF-1, it's an anabolic hormone (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin-like_growth_factor_1) if you want to read up on it).
Plant proteins, e.g soy protein ([Messina, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28434035)), also increase levels of IGF-1.
One study even noted higher IGF-1 levels from plant protein:

SP = Soy Protein  
MP = Milk Protein  

*Healthy men (59.2 +/- 17.6 y) were assigned to consume 40 g of either SP or milk-based protein (MP) daily for 3 mo in a double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel design.
Serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which is associated with higher rates of bone formation, was greater (P &lt; 0.01) in men supplemented with SP than in those consuming MP.
*

*Khalil DA, et al.
* ["Soy protein supplementation increases serum insulin-like growth factor-I in young and old men but does not affect markers of bone metabolism"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12221217) *J Nutr.
2002 Sep;132(9):2605-8.
*

But again this type of study is only looking at a biomarker and not actual incidence, it's like looking at exercise and noting that it increases inflammation and tissue damage and then saying that exercise is bad.
&gt; [Drinking milk raises estrogen levels.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19496976)

&gt; [Source 2] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4524299/)

&gt; [Source 3, albeit a weak one.
There haven't been many studies done on this topic; but all that have, show increased estrogen and lower testosterone.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19496976)

&gt; Raised estrogen levels, combined with IGF-1 hormones, clearly demonstrate increased cancer risk.
Again just speculation on biomarkers and we don't see any benefit in mortality from people going vegetarian.
&gt; (This is from a report by the WHO: http://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/)

I agree that it's possible that processing food (both plants and meat) can have some detrimental effects, but processing wasn't part of the argument I was making or responding to.
The IARC report actually noted that there was insufficient evidence to classify read meat as carcinogenic and poultry and fish tend to have no, or negative, association with cancer ([longer post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/3q9p70/the_who_has_ranked_processed_meats_in_the_same/cwfddvn/)).
&gt; **ATHEROSCLEROSIS AND HEART DISEASE**:

&gt; [Total cholesterol is clearly increased by dietary cholesterol.]
(https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article-abstract/55/6/1060/4715430?redirectedFrom=PDF)

&gt; [Heart disease is clearly linked to high cholesterol levels.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072886/)

&gt; [Cholesterol crystals activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, leading to atherogenesis.]
(https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08938)

&gt; (Atherogenesis means the genesis of atherosclerosis, which is the clogging of arteries by fat and cholesterol.)
&gt; [Most children by age ten have signs of atherosclerosis in their arteries.
We are clearly not supposed to consume animal products for optimal health if atherosclerosis begins at such a young age due to their consumption.]
(http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/72/5/1307s.full)

&gt; As you can guess, meat consumption raises blood cholesterol levels.
&gt; [There are at least 3 mechanisms in which a plant-based diet prevents and reverses cardiovascular disease.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315380/)

Total cholesterol includes HDL, using the same logic as above then raising HDL would cause increased risk of heart disease.
But studies show that in general higher HDL is associated with lower risk of heart disease and dietary cholesterol isn't relevant.
*Previously, the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to no more than 300 mg/day.
The 2015 DGAC will not bring forward this recommendation because available
evidence shows
no appreciable
relationship between consumption of dietary
cholesterol and serum cholesterol, consistent with the conclusions of the AHA/ACC report^2, ^35*

*Cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption*

*Health and Human Services, Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion* ["Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee"](http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/PDFs/Scientific-Report-of-the-2015-Dietary-Guidelines-Advisory-Committee.pdf) *Feb 2015*

&gt; [The only clinically proven way to reverse heart disease is through a plant-based diet.]
(http://dresselstyn.com/JFP_06307_Article1.pdf)

I addressed this in an earlier post, I'll just post that reply here.
As far as I know there are no good "whole foods, plant based diet" studies, as in randomized controlled trial with other "healthy" diets as controls, showing reversal of atherosclerosis.
The problem with the existing studies ([Schuler, 1992](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1729343))([Ornish, 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9863851))([Esselstyn, 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7500065)) is that there are no other intervention groups and the intervention in the "plant based" group is also to stop smoking, exercising more, eating less processed food, etc.
which means it's hard to measure if there's actually any effect from the "plant based" part

**DIABETES**

&gt; [Vegans have a 78% lower risk of diabetes.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073139/)

&gt; [Meat consumption is a huge risk factor for diabetes.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942738/)

&gt; [A plant-based diet is effective at treating diabetes.]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677007/)

We have randomized controlled trials showing reduced risk of diabetes on a variety of diets ([Ajala, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364002)) it's not limited to only vegans, and people see that regardless of eating meat or not.
&gt; [The longest lived populations on Earth are the Adventist Vegetarians and the Okinawans, and they both eat a predominantly high carb, low fat diet.

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191896/)

Among the Longevity Blue Zone groups you also have Sardinians which actually eat more meat than the surrounding populations, and they eat mostly red meat.
You also have the Nicoya who have a diet relatively high in meat compared to neighboring populations:

*Up to a short time ago, the LBZ population depended mostly upon livestock rearing, and consumption of animal-derived foods was relatively higher than in the rest of the island.
*

...

*In particular, the overall intake of meat was only 77% of the Italian average, although in the LBZ the figures were much higher owing to the consumption of sheep and goat meat not registered in official statistics.
The same could be said about milk and its derivatives, as Tivaroni in 1921 estimated a 79% higher dairy intake in Sardinia as a whole compared with the Italian mainland*

&gt; [Dairy causes insulin resistance.
](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4325471/)

There are two problems here, one is that you're just looking at a single study, and the second is that this is once again just an isolated biomarker.
Systematic reviews show that most studies actually report an increase in insulin sensitivity:

*In adults, four of the dairy interventions showed a positive effect on insulin sensitivity as assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA); one was negative and five had no effect.

&gt; Diabetes is caused by fat, not sugar:

Ketogenic diets, where you eat mostly fat, is one of the most effective ways of reversing pre-diabetes and managing type 2 diabetes ([longer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/4blc8i/recently_was_told_i_was_prediabetic_my_wife_is/d1ajqjg/)).

If you want to dive into the analogy, I'd say it's fairly apt considering how the change would be about as reversible as attaching a prosthetic.
You can re-apply something in place of the arm, but it's not going to be the same.
If you halt all beef production for 1-2 generations, the culture and dietary habits of people will fundamentally change.
Look at how the short-term removal of a single ingredient alters the long-term culinary demand.
For example, black currant.
It used to be a common and popular flavor, but was outlawed due to fear of disease spread.
We've since bred disease immune currant cultivars but in its absence grape and blackberry have now become the expected flavor for "purple/black fruit".
So if you look at Skittles in the US and Skittles in the UK, the flavors will be different.
So if we outlaw beef today and only re-introduce it in 2200 when we have achieved enough scientific progress, by that point beef will no longer have the same level of demand because the American cultural diet has shifted from beef burgers to chicken sandwiches.
This is akin to attaching a prosthetic arm because it's like having your old arm, but it's not quite the same.
I'd advocate for allowing beef to be produced and humans to adapt accordingly with the right incentives.
Lets say in 2100 beef prices have risen because most of Africa is now developed and wealthy enough to afford beef as part of their regular diet.
The price of beef is now almost doubled, so if someone can find a way to produce beef more efficiently, they'd profit handsomely.
Maybe in 1 decade's time, they'd come up with a revolutionary solution and beef prices return to the old equilibrium we're used to.
This is because there's still a demand for beef.
But in a world where beef has been outlawed, people in 2100 won't care about beef because they can't miss what they've never had, just like black &amp; red currant.
This past weekend I was at a food trade show where I tasted no less than 5 new brands of vegan cheese.
Some were very realistic and creamy!
I'm excited to see them in stores!
I had some mac n cheese made with cashew cheese at a vegan restaurant.
No idea what cashew cheese is but it tasted like some delicious mildly sharp cheddar.
&gt; Some were very realistic and creamy

the sacrifices in flavor and nutrition makes me laugh about vegans.
ill just stick to real cheese.
[deleted]
What sacrifice in nutrition?
[deleted]
for starters, The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics warns of the risk of vitamin B12 deficiencies in vegetarians and vegans.
Vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal products.
A lack of vitamin B12 can lead to anemia and blindness.
shall i keep going?
Yeah the list of deficiencies is quite extensive, although there are some work-around substitutes but nothing is as good as the real thing.
And before anyone fires back, meat is  good in moderation, balancing diets is what is important.
For example I eat turkey sausages instead of pork, I think they taste considerably better and they have something like 90% less fat.
Animal cruelty.
Overall health (dairy was killing me, I didn’t know).
Climate change.
Environmental benefit.
Ya just take B12.
Prob fixed.
They are not extensive.
Ever had vegan cheese?
Do you know how it tastes?
The very same Academy also states vegan diets are completely healthy and have every nutrient.
If you risk a vitamin B12 deficiency just take more B12.
What deficiencies are they then?
You can get all your nutrients on a vegan diet.
Most soy is grown for animal feed actually.
I'm not a vegan by any means and eat at least a pound of meat a day, but I already avoid lactose products and eat cashews.
At least for me, this would be something I'd buy and use regularly.
That's a big reason why vegan products are taking off, because they're getting good enough to appeal to people with omnivore diets.
It is like asking what deficiencies does the average American diet have?
It is fluid on a case by case basis but with a vegan diet on average B12 is the major one, things like calcium, zinc, iron, Omega-3, three of the four types of protein is also persistent.
The fact I am down-voted for stating a fact it is a clear indicator that a normal conversation cant be had.
So you're stating people have don't have perfect nutrition and deficiencies occure?
Okay, but what's your point?
We're having normal conversation right now aren't we?
Downvotes don't matter if you don't care about them, chill.
Natural food expo in Baltimore?
!
What I am saying is if you had a perfectly designed vegan diet that brings together a host of different plants and food stuff's from all around the world then you can have close to a normal nutrient intake.
But (as with normal diets) vegans tend to buy vegan stuff and not consider what nutrients they are or are not getting.
As a result a significant number of vegans do not meet minimum requirements for nutrient intake in a number of areas.
So to paint both diets with a broad brush a typical meat inclusive diet is far superior than a vegan diet.
The main benefit of a vegan diet is most people eat crap from when they get up to when they go to bed, so there are initial benefits to a vegan diet including feeling better and more alert, but as I say this isn't because a vegan diet is good, rather the old diet they was on is really bad.
Veganism seems a collection of serious flaws, sowed together with good intentions and presented as perfection.
Going vegan maybe 6 days out of 7 might very well be a good thing, but a significant portion of our dietary needs are met with meat, that said not all meat is created equal either.
It is best to have a solid all-round diet.
[deleted]
Depends on where you're from I guess, how well people tend to eat.
Most vegans know more about nutrition than others, so most vegans don't have deficiencies.
A significant number of non-vegans also get deficiencies.
It's easy to ensure you get all nutrients on a vegan diet, especially with all the information available everywhere.
You don't need meat or animal products for that at all.
Not really.
It doesn't depend on anything.
&gt; Soybean meal has become a predominant feedstock for poultry and livestock, accounting for 67% of consumption of global soy production.
https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/land-use/industrial-agriculture/soy-agriculture

So yes, most soy grown now goes to feeding animals.

Cashew is pretty good.
Accidentally bought Forager cashew milk yogurt and it was a pretty good knock off.
I’ve bought the brand a few more times.
&gt; Vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal products.
This is 100% false.
B12 does not come from animals or plants.
It comes from bacteria.
It's abundant in a lot of animal products because farm animals are typically fed supplements, which you can supplement yourself.
Also pretty much every plant milk is fortified with B12.
Silk soy milk for example has 50% of your daily requirement in a single cup.
&gt;shall i keep going?
Yes, please do.
The only 2 not accessible easily through a vegan diet is B12 and Vitamin D - those are easy to fortify vegan milks and cheeses with - that's how its done.
Nope!
A little more north and east.
Pretty much choice.
Same as someone who doesn't like to eat oysters for the taste or someone whose religion prevents the from eating pork.
All down to choices.
I’m sorry but “religion preventing” you from doing something is not a choice.
And please don’t compare a vegan lifestyle to religion, vegans are vegan for a real reason.
I guess their comments were so well-informed and intelligent that they had to delete them all for fear of blowing our feeble minds!
As someone who is severely lactose intolerant, I am SO thankful for the vegan movement.
I had Vegan sushi a couple weeks ago and it was pretty good (coming from a sushi lover).
Wasn’t as good as the real thing but if I was allergic to seafood I would definitely get down on that.
Is lactose free milk vegan?
No, but nut milks are.
Almond milk is!
Lactaid milk and such don’t work for me anyway.
Ah,  you mean juice....
Not sure i care what it is; tastes fairly close to milk and it doesn’t leave me on the shitter for 4-5 hours wishing I was dead.
😂.
Shouldnt lactose free milk solve the same problem?
It should in theory, yes.
But it doesn’t.
Not sure why.
Lactaid free ice cream screws me up too, where almondmilk ice cream does not.
Crazy im extremely lactose intolerant and works perfect for me, i cant stand the juices.
It's been called milk for hundreds of years.
You're not going to change that for whatever grudge you have against plant milk.
&gt;As someone who is severely lactose intolerant, I am SO thankful for the vegan movement.
really it is.
I also begin with my lactose intolerant journey now.
to be healthy.
Most of it hasn't even existed for tens of years....

If it’s still milk from a cow it is not vegan.
I recommend you read this page:

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/nut-milks-are-milk-says-almost-every-culture-across-globe-180970008/
**Plant milk**

Plant milk has been consumed for centuries in various cultures, both as a regular drink (such as the Spanish horchata) and as a substitute for dairy milk.
The most popular varieties are soy milk, almond milk, rice milk and coconut milk.
The protein content varies.
It contains no lactose or cholesterol, and is usually sold with added calcium and vitamins, especially B12.

Summary: 
Not on an American diet.
You can get all your nutrients on a vegan diet.
I love people who think like this.
&gt; there is no dietary cholesterol in plant-based diets  

Cite?
Maybe you mean plant-based diet?
But then again it might not.
You don't need meat or animal products for that at all.
That awareness is what I mean by being "educated".
They will eventually get there, I think.
It is like asking what deficiencies does the average American diet have?
&gt; All I said was that you can't feed 7B people on an American diet.
Because the topic is not whether one should be vegan.
Is lactose free milk vegan?
All I said was that you can't feed 7B people on an American diet.
&gt; You can't feed 7B people on an 'American' animal-based diet.
Depends on where you're from I guess, how well people tend to eat.
I don't think there's any conclusive reasons on why this is the case.
You can't feed 7B people on an 'American' animal-based diet.
I will say I never thought I could go vegan.
In the end, I think it's easiest and most accurate and correct to say "vegan diet".
“Since cholesterol comes only from animal foods, vegan diets are, by definition, cholesterol-free.
