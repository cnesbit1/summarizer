His arms probably have no skin left.
Edit: his arms and face have no skin left.

It looks like his face is sliding along the pavement for a while as well.
An unfair amount of road rash.
Your edit is why I only use a full face helmet.
A perfectly fair amount for someone who rides an unmaintained bike with no gear.
I saw this associated with the term “flesh crayon,” or “human crayon.” Pretty graphic visual.
Same.
I don’t risk it.
No matter how hot it is outside.
From a guy who went face first into a Mazda at speed back in April, ALWAYS wear a full face.
It literally saved my life (and my face)!
Edit: Yes I still got messed up.
Broke a hand, my pelvis shattered (got it bolted back together), broke a leg and foot.
Didn't wear proper boots, valuable lesson learned...

Oh well, a very typical Harley Riders...
Unmaintained?
I think you mean Harley.
I don't even see half/three quarter helmets as actual helmets.
I'd rather not lose my ability to eat/drink/speak/sleep comfortably.
That is if you don't lose your jaw.
Bingo!
And I used to wear one of those half helmets.
Until I saw a few videos like this one.

Yep.
I'd rather sweat than bleed.
&gt;(got it bolted back together) 

Just reading that made *my* pelvis hurt, jeeze.
It's been quite an ordeal.
Thankfully I'm only 37 and I was in good phys health when I got hit.
Young lady on a cell phone crossed center on 2 Lane hwy...
I lost mo's of work, underwent 2 surgeries (I now have a 5" titanium lag bolt thru my pelvis) and I'll have another on my foot this fall.
Thank God I'm a lucky one b/c I have very little back pain and 5 mo's later life is almost back completely to normal!
At least until my next for surgery...
I slid for a bit after hitting a deer.
Burned through my jeans and leather jacket but my full face helmet saved my face from damage.
Jfc, dude, that's gnarly.
Here's to hoping that your next surgery goes well and you heal up alright.
