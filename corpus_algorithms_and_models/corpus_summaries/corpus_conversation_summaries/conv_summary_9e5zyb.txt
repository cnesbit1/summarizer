Original Response: 
When I was maybe 10 I wrote a letter to Jean Chretien demanding that kids be given the right to vote because the charter doesn't say anything about a voting age, it only says that all citizens can vote.
I got a letter just like this answering none of my questions and responding to none of my arguments and I was just about as pissed off as I've ever been.
Be glad ole JC didnt give 10 year old you his very poopulair Shawinigan Handshale.
If kids could vote, that sponge Bob would be in charge.
I had the same experience.
I remember being so incredibly annoyed at the form letter and a signed photo.
Why in the world would I ever want a photo of Chretien?
I just wanted my opinions taken seriously.
10 year old me is still pissed off.
Wut.
The [Shawinigan Handshake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawinigan_Handshake?wprov=sfti1) seems to be referring to an incident in February 1996 where PM Jean Chrétien put a protestor in a chokehold when he blocked access to his limousine in Hull, Québec.
Not sure how it relates to PM JT.
Its hard to write a response to a kid about that without sounding like theyre saying all children are fucking idiots.
Haha interesting.
Thanks for the link.
I'd respect him for saying it.
"You can't vote because kids are morons, but as adults it's our responsibility to make sure you don't stay that way so do your fucking homework Timmy."
It doesnt refer to JT the commenter I was replying to said he sent a letter to Chretien.
Thus JC.
If adults could vote Donald Trump would be the President of the United States.
... yep it checks out.

Summary: 
I had the same experience.
