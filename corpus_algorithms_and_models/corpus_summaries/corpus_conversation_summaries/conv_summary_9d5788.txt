Not all trying is sexual harassment.
Look at how the study defined sexual harassment.
First paragraph.
"The survey of 1,002 girls aged 14-21, published on September 5, showed that more than one-third (38 percent) of girls are catcalled, experience wolf whistling or are at the receiving end of sexual comments in public at least once every month"

That's not flirting.
That is harrasment and done mostly by adult men not other children.
Sexual harrasment is sexual harrasment.
Listen before talking out of your arse.
The speices isn't fucked.
People  just aren't entitled to scare others for their amusement.
No one is being accused of sexual harassment for just saying hello, that is just something guys like to hypothesize will happen now that more women are pushing back against actual sexual harrassment and assault.
Its an attempt by men to get women to go back to being afraid to speak out.
Edit: stupid autocorrect.
Maybe read the article first before commenting then you might not sound so foolish.
There should be a better understanding between the sexes though so that men and boys actually understand how to show their interest without making women feel uncomfortable.
And cat-calling/shouting complements at women in the street is more an attempted show of power than an attempt at showing interest IMO.
I've never felt flattered or keen after being shouted at from a car for my number.
There's a difference between genuinely trying to show interest and affection and harassment behaviour.
This study was about girls.
Try reading the link first because you're coming across extremely creepy.
Don't flirt with children.

It reminds me of how every man on the sex offender registries claim it was due to something innocuous like public urination.
Pleeeease.

You’re being ridiculous.
It’s easy not to harass others.
Period.
Don't know a woman well enough to know if she's going to report you to HR?
Then don't make those comments.
See how easy it is?
