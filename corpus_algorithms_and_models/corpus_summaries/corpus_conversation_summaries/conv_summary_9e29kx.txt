Original Response: 
Between the 1950s and the early 1970s, my grandparents owned a residential motel in Corpus Christi called the Cedar Lodge.
It consisted of six or eight separate cottages laid out parallel to the road, and was located on what was then State Hwy.
9, which I understand was removed from the State Highway System when Interstate 37 was completed.
But I have no idea where, and I'm trying to track down where it was.
It would be interesting to take a look at the area on Google Earth and see what it looks like today.Does anyone remember this place?
An address might be too much to expect, but if anyone can point me to a general locale, that would be a start.Thanks in advance.
I think Hwy 9 was what is now Leopard Street.
It was a major thoroughfare back in the day.
There are still some motels from the era along the western end of the street as you head toward the Anaville area.
you need to call the central library and talk to someone in local history.
That's a great idea.
Thanks!
