Original Response: 
I just need books showing how Christ is the messiah and why Jews are wrong.
Why?
they are gods people too they are just blinded by god himself to bring salvation to the world, until the great tribulation.
there will be a remnant that come to Christ .
Read Romans 11
Edit.
Look up something on jesus in the Old Testament.
Check out behold Israel on you tube he has sermons on this and Jesus in the feasts.
They missed the first coming, don’t understand what the messiah is for and what he is and are waiting for a world leader who will end up being the antichrist they will reject him when he claims to be god and then they will turn to jesus.
That’s not to say you shouldn’t try to tell them about Jesus.
but they already know all the stories .
And they have to come to it on their own.
They don’t like being preached to.
Also Isaiah is a good one to prove jesus.
My dads Jewish and is cool with me being a follower of jesus but he’s practically in love with being Jewish that he won’t accept him as messiah (yet) he just says to me we don’t believe in trying to change people’s beliefs .
(That means daughter stop trying to convert me)

 “What then?
What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain.
The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.””
‭‭Romans‬ ‭11:7-8‬ ‭NIV‬‬
http://bible.com/111/rom.11.7-8.
Read all of Romans 11.
It explains everything 

“I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way all Israel will be saved.
As it is written: “The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.”
‭‭Romans‬ ‭11:25-26‬ ‭NIV‬‬
http://bible.com/111/rom.11.25-26.niv

Israel is blinded until the end of the gentile times.
The gentile times are now up until the great tribulation.
Jesus will bring his people to him in the end and there will be a grafted olive tree with cultivated (Jews ) wild (gentiles) to the root (jesus)

If you were born a gentile rabbis  try to talk people out of converting to Judaism you have to ask three times and they will tell you no the first 2.
I think, and then allow you to convert they believe your soul can be Jewish .
but yes if you want to make Aliyah being Christian will be problematic as will other laws.
So yes if your an ethnic Jew they’d want you to be  a religious Jew or even secular if your mother or maternal grand mother is Jewish.
but if you are Christian it kind of cancels out your heritage as far as emigration  to Israel.
You have to come in the same way gentiles come in.
Even though I’m Jewish ethnically 53% (as per my dna test) I’d have to convert by a rabbi to make Aliyah because my mother wasn’t Jewish and my father was mostly secular until about 20 years ago when he became orthodox.

Yes I don’t like it because if there was another holocaust I’d be rounded up too.
My grandparents survived it and yet I’m not considered to be part of my heritage unless I’m Also Jewish as described by the religious customs.
I’ve talked to some people and they now believe that the soul comes from the mother.
Modern Judaism has changed from
The Israelites.

I was raised mostly non religious my mom tried to be a Jehovah’s Witness after my parents divorce  for a little while but that was a cult so we just didn’t have any religious affiliation for most of my life.
my dad was always Jewish but he was mostly secular until I was a teen I accepted jesus when I was 33 .
5 years ago.
[deleted]
That’s awesome.
Was it hard on you?
Did they take it well?
[deleted]
&gt;Actually Jewish rabbis do tries to convert people.
Which is why they have Chabad place all through out the world.
I've talked to plenty of them and read a lot of their writings.
Never come across any proselytizing by Chabad.
I wonder if you are confusing convert and proselytize.
Those people aren't Jewish.
Those B'nei Menashe base their claims on a freaking dream.
They are nothing but economic migrants and I disagree with any agency that brings them to Israel.

Jesus is god in the flesh .
He’s who Adam and Eve walked with in the garden he was the light and word at the beginning of the world he’s the part of god that is the visible manifestation of god in the physical world.
The messiah was always meant to take our sin upon him and the only person who can forgive sin is the one whom sin is committed against.
And all sin and evil isn’t the opposite of god it’s the absence of god.
Jesus even told the Pharisees that they didn’t understand the prophets.
All the prophecy only make sense once you add jesus.
Do a study on the typology of jesus and you will see foreshadowing of him from day 1 

And that’s not limiting god that shows the scope of his love for us that he would take on human flesh to pay our price.
The price for sin is eternal death.
[removed]
I will put it together some scripture in a few hrs I have to go do something and I don’t have the time id like to put into that.
but jesus in the Old Testament is concealed that is why I said to do a typology study his messiah ship was foreshadowed as well as our need for blood sacrifice.
The law was to show us what sin was.
And that we can’t keep the law wo having to atone over and over for ever for sin.
It was never meant to be a permanent arrangement.
It was a nanny to keep God’s people clean separate and to cultivate a people to bring his word and the messiah through.
Jesus was the natural progression but they missed his first coming and the second coming is for the Jews as well.
I’ll get into that more later.

I'm Jewish I know my history lol.
The original Israelite kingdom was called Judah.
During the Persian Period the land became a province of that empire, called Yehud; then in the Roman Period, the land became a Roman province called Judea

But during the time of 2 Kings 16 there were two Jewish kingdoms.
They wouldn't know anything about the Talmud because they aren't Israelites.
The Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmud were authored in Assyria and Jerusalem respectively but they are the Oral Torah and were in tradition much longer.
Yes well ever wonder if 10 northern tribes of Israel broke away from Judah?
The beliefs weere  called Semetics or Hebrew beliefs.
Then the man said, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.” But Jacob replied, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”  The man asked him, “What is your name?” “Jacob,” he answered.
Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with humans and have overcome.”  Jacob said, “Please tell me your name.” But he replied, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed him there.
So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.”
Genesis 32:26‭-‬30 NIV
https://bible.com/bible/111/gen.32.26-30.NIV

We don't worship Jesus.
If you read Jeremiah God divorced israel northern tribes of Israel because of her adultery.
To make a blood covenant again there had to be perfect blood offering.
Judah was same except scepter will not depart from Judah.
As the promised stated by God.
Here's some verse to show I personally don't observe Jesus as God.
He is Lord (title name), son of man, and first born of son of God.
Which is why he came from Judah as God loved Israel over Esau.
They did not understand that he was telling them about his Father.
So Jesus said, “When you have lifted up  the Son of Man, then you will know that I am he and that I do nothing on my own but speak just what the Father has taught me.
The one who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what pleases him.”
John 8:27‭-‬29 NIV
https://bible.com/bible/111/jhn.8.27-29.NIV

Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing.
My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me.
Though you do not know him, I know him.
If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word.
Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”
John 8:54‭-‬56 NIV
https://bible.com/bible/111/jhn.8.54-56.NIV.
Chabad’s objective is Jewish outreach.
They want to help Jews, especially unaffiliated Jews, reconnect themselves to Judaism.
Chabad is interested in “converting” Jews to Judaism, they are not interested in converting non-Jews to Judaism.
Chabad representatives will never be going door-to-door preaching to non-Jews the message of the Torah.
They are focused only on fellow Jews.
Also, there are Chabad houses in Islamic countries.
In fact, the Chabad house in Tanzania is in Zanzibar which is 99% Muslim.
It is located in Zanzibar to facilitate Jewish practice for Jewish visitors to the area; it is not there to convert the local Muslims.
The Beta Israel have been practicing Judaism long before contact with mainstream Judaism.
They did not have to convert to Orthodox Judaism as they are recognized as being Jewish.
For those who are of historically non-Jewish backgrounds who wish to become part of the Jewish people (such as the B’nei Menashe), such people must convert *if they want to be recognized as Jews*.
If they don’t want to, they don’t have to.
These conversions are *self-motivated*, not the result of Jewish proselytism.
As for your concerns over the name “Judah” and “Judaism”, all Israelites came to be called by the name of Judah.
When the Northern Kingdom of Samaria fell, some refugees fled to the Southern Kingdom of Judah.
These people, regardless of tribe, were citizens of the Kingdom of Judah and thus referred to as Jews.
In Exile, we see Mordechai described as a Jew from the Tribe of Benjamin.
When the Israelites (called Jews) returned, their province was referred to as Judea.
All inhabitants were known as Jews.
Thus Paul is referred to as a Jew even though he’s tribally a Benjaminite.
Following the destruction of Judea in 70 CE and the Diaspora, all the refugees from Judea were continuously called Jews.
So I don’t really see why you take issue with all of Israel in the present being called by the name of Judah; it’s something done in the Bible itself.

I answered your questions in my last comment.
While Tanzania has a Christian majority, Zanzibar does not.
Zanzibar is around 99% Muslim.
The Chabad house in Tanzania is in Zanzibar.
Its purpose is primarily provide services to Jewish visitors to the area.
So, no, I’m not saying that Jewish people ended up all over Africa.
I’m saying that many Jews visit Africa, and some of them like being able to pray with other Jews while they travel.
You have to understand the difference between proselytize and convert.
So at this point you are trying to deceive people.
Why?
[deleted]
Why do you do this dishonesty?
Jews will convert those that ask and show dedicated desire.
They do not proselytize.
No, Chabad is not moving into Africa to convert Christians.
Your are busy projecting, blaming Jews for the things Christians do.
You would celebrate a church doing this.
