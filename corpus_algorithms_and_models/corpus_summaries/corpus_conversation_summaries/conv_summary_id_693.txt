Original Response: 
Looking for a gym with some type of powerlifting type equipment, bands, chains, et .
Iâ€™ve tried calling and contacting the owner of IronHorse, but Iâ€™ve gotten no response.
Any ideas?
Thanks!
Golds Gym on staples.
I don't think iron horse is open.
There's different crossfit gyms.
I go to Lynns us gym.
It has basic free weights.
Not to much power lifting specific stuff.
Don't know how far you want to drive, but Pure Energy 24 Fitness in Portland just across the bridge is well equipped.
Good powerlifting dungeon in the back, as well as an outdoor area with atlas stones and strongman equipment.
Hey!
Iâ€™m a power lifter.
Next Generation gym!
I used goldâ€™s but itâ€™s not worth $50 a month.
And next gen is 24/7.
Sounds perfect, appreciate It man!
I was pretty disappointed by next generation.
Only one flat bench and almost all the barbells were bent to some degree.
They have some strongman equipment, which is neat.
Pickings for powerlifting training are slim in Corpus.
Iron Horse should still be open, but you may have better luck showing up in person.
Just realized theyâ€™re invitation only.
I've had good times at landshark.
Daily is 10 bucks or 28 a month for a gym membership.
I'm considering doing that place instead of a gym in sinton I go too.
How much u bench bro?
Lol.
Iâ€™m a woman... my max is only around 70.

I believe you can pay to use the TAMUCC gym.
It's pretty good.
