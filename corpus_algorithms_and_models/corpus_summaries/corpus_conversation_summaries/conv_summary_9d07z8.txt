Talk about your day.
Anything goes, but subreddit rules still apply.
Please be polite to each other!
Lol I’m 19 and my parents still think it’s too young to have a boyfriend..
Truth is I’ve been together with my bf since sec one...  should I just keep lying to them or what &gt;___&gt; gets inconvenient when I have to lie about my whereabouts.
I think generally parents don't mind their daughter have bf, they are just afraid that they'll get pregnant so young.
Wow you hide six years already!
How did you do that.
When I was 15 I hid the fact that I had gf for almost two years, it was super tiring.
Think they suspected too but I am a guy so maybe that’s different.
My mum told my sis to get a boyfriend when she finishes uni 3 years later.
You parent's tune will change past a certain age.
"why you want bf?
why you want bf?
why you want bf?"
to 

"why you no bf?
why you no bf?
why you no bf? "
Happening to my sister now.
Shes 28.
lol🤣.
Inside maybe they think it's fine, but the cultural belief that "it's always too early" is probably what is stopping them from accepting.
Since you are in a long-term rs already, try to bring him over for fam dinner occasionally.
Sooner or later they won't object too much to it.
Yea parents always fear that their daughters will get taken advantage of lol.
Intro pls thx.
Become pregnant, keep bf.
Win win.

Just tell them you hanging out with your friends?
Or are they tht strict tht they don't allow you to hang out with your friends?
Hmm, I remember being in your situation, cept, I'm a guy.
I think you can just tell them, of course, they'd still be worried.
Mainly for daughters safety, and unwanted pregnancy.
I have a couple-pair friends from primary school.
Girl liked guy since around p6...?
Girl's mother was strict too; no bf until 16 (but I think they got together secretly)

Their wedding is coming later this month and I'm invited.
Then mum ask why she no bf 3 years later, "can go find not"

xiao sads.
I am going to tell my parents that I am going to be forever alone and they won't be able to 抱孙.
feelsbadman.
Unless they allow me to marry vietnam bu or other kind of bu but not a sinkie bu.
Happened to me too.
My first bf was at 17 and she was so afraid that the guy will rape me or something.
Then we broke up and at 19 during my clubbing days she thought I was a hooker.
Lol When I turned 21 with a bf she asked when I’m going to give her grandkids.
Moved in but didn’t marry at 24 and she got a shock when she found out we were sleeping on the same bed.
What do you want, woman?
!
Yeah when I went to the US with my parents, I also wanted to meet my very good friend whom I met in college back in Singapore.
Since my parents have no interest in my life, they don’t know who my friends are (although I invited him over many times for Christmas and cny).
But since he’s a guy and I’m a girl, he will definitely rape me (her words).
So, instead of being able to enjoy NYC with my long time friend whom I haven’t seen in years, she tagged along with us and it was really awkward.
We were also there during the longest summer days but she gave me a curfew at 8pm, when the sun is still out.
NYC is the city that never sleeps but I never got to experience it at night.
I just told them that he was my gay friend.
Haha!
To this day she still thinks he’s gay.
He’s a bit soft, I’d have to say.
Funny thing is she allows female friends to stay over but not male friends.
But she doesn’t know that I also like women.
:) so.. checkmate, Mom!
True but parents always have something to worry about.
When I had my first bf they were afraid I’d get pregnant, (but interestingly they never bothered to teach me safe sex) but then they found out I was on the pill and got even more mad.
I mean, is it you don’t want me pregnant or you don’t want me having sex at all?
Which means no bf at all?
It seems they want us to be single and virgin all the way until we find *the one*, get married and have kids right away.
say that hes just a fwb.
how did your parents take it when they discovered about you coming out of the closet?
now am at, why you no baby.
Wait... What?
I'm straight.

Aww that’s nice, hopefully mine will turn out that way too :-)
Yeah but we’re still friends and he knows about it.
Although I did tell my mom that he hasn’t come out yet so they never had to talk about it.
Pretty smart eh?
Heh.
