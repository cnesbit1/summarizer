Hello, I have the Palkia listed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gkj3W6_7CV3mL5aLH6dVI39GhaoR7hHUncPeIHVT050/edit#gid=1984605323&amp;range=162:162)

I can also do NA/JPN redeems on any of the 7th gen games.
Edit: I'm interested in LL codes.
How many are you looking for?
for each.
I'd like 3 LL codes per Palkia and for redeems I can do 1:1.
Sounds good to me I can do the palkia whenever.
How many redeems would you be looking to do?
Sorry I read kinda wrong was on mobile.
Would you do 9 codes for lvl 100 modest dialga, lvl 60 timid palkia, and lvl 100 modest palkia.
Sure np.
I'll do those 3 for 9 codes then.
As for redeems, I'm capable of doing bulk if you're not in a rush.
I'd say 2 playthroughs per day with however many redeems per save.
Let me know what all you need redeemed and how many you're looking for.
I'll go less than 1:1 if you're doing multiple redeems on a save.
I'll also take KG codes in return for the redeems.
Ok let me know whenever you want to trade.
Id be happy to send you the codes first.
And then for redeems.
If youd like id be happy to just get rid of all the codes lol.
Would you do 18 redeems (6 of each code) for 7 K/G codes and 5 L/L codes?
I could do that, sure.
Let me know the details of what you want to be redeemed - nature, date, language, etc.
If you aren't concerned about the levels, I'll most likely do them all on US/UM games :D 

Edit: But I can do the sun/moon versions too!
---------

I'll add you and be online in a moment for the Palkias/Dialga.
I need to get them out of the bank.
You can send the codes during the trade, no worries.
My IGN will be Hinako.
That works ill go online now.
I'm getting on now too!
Sending the proofs as well in a moment.
And then for details on reedems just 3 of each with the start date of each event, any competitiveish natures (not too worried about it tho), and then 2 ENG, 1 JPN of each.
Lvl 100 for all is fine with me!
Thx!

Okay, take your time.
Honestly in no hurry.
Thanks!
I should be done by tomorrow afternoon!
Would you be around to trade then?
Oh nice!
So I've been playing Pokemon go there's an event from 11-2 pst so anytime after that I'll be free.
Actually, I've been busy with some irl things that popped up :( Would you be able to trade tomorrow instead?
Any time would be fine.
Yeah that's ok :)
Free whenever you are.
OK!
I'll be out for a bit.
Will you be available in about 2 hours?
Should be!
I'm home now and ready to trade!
:D My IGN will be Cassie when we go online.
Ok!
Going online now.
Thank you for the trade!
Please let me know if I made any errors though.
Thank you looks all great!
