Leafs are 0-1 since the existence of Gritty!
Jesus...Brian Burke was right all along.
Leafs needs a mascot called Truculancy.
Why do you think Lou is so scared of facial hair?
I knew I didn't like that thing.
It's a discipline thing with him.
All team, no individual.
Because he is a power-tripping dinosaur.
Welcome to the year 0 GCE (gritty common era)
He should just make then wear ties in the ice then.
Because he lays in bed at night dreaming of George Steinbrenner.
h i s t o r i c  l o s s.

Summary: 
It's a discipline thing with him.
