You’re not being unreasonable.
A relationship comes with the understanding that you’re going to make a certain amount of time for each other.
It doesn’t sound like he’s doing that.
Without that investment of attention, you’re his roommate/maid, not his girlfriend.
I've spoken to him before about how I feel we're in a roommate situation rather than a couple, and he agrees and feels the same.
I start therapy next week so I'll probably bring it up in one of my sessions.
We have other issues that are probably compounding this but I really would like to work through this with him to move forward.
Even roommates make time to do chores, at least.
Does he do that, OP?
He does do some chores, I do the majority but I prefer to do a lot of them myself so I know they're done my way.
He only has to hoover and take out the trash:
Aww, I wish I had a ~~mom~~ girlfriend like that.
/s.
We're both happy with the way chores are split but thanks.

And I'm happy, so what's the problem?

I'm happy with the chores, which are not mentioned in my post at all.
Completely separate issues.
When my ex and I split he got the perfect life for him -- no spouse or kids to interrupt his gaming life.
I've remarried and my second husband adopted the kids so we are happy too.
Id suggest letting your boyfriend have the life he obviously wants and you go find an actual boyfriend.
But you should remember that that isn't healthy for future relationships.
If you volunteer to do 90% of chores, they're going to always expect that.
They're not going to learn to do the courses properly.
When you have children, you deal with those alone too.
There's tons of posts like that here as well.

No, it's the decision we've come to together.
I've always been like this with chores and if I feel like I need any extra help for any reason I ask him.
