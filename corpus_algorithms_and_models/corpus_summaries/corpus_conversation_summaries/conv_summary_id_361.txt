Original Response: 
My husband just told me about a pelican he just saw, it is tangled up in fishing line, but then hanging from the highline.
I am trying to find someone that can go cut it loose and possibly even untangle it from the fishing line.Edit - I just managed to catch a person at the Aquarium that said they would get someone out there to take care of it.
That's good.
I was going to suggest calling Tony Amos at the ARK.
I think that is who the lady at the bird center said she was talking to about it.
Right now the problem is finding someone that can access the bird.
I think they are trying to get a hold of the fire department - but I don't think they have been successful in getting someone out there.The type of boat my husband is on is high enough to get to the bird, but they are moving a barge, and couldn't stop.
But she said that the other person (maybe that Tony?)
said that the reports he is hearing is that the bird is 10-20 feet up, my husband said 20-30 feet above the water.Do you have any ideas?
Let me ask you - much later today, do you think you can swing by and see if they ever got it down or not?
I can tell you where it is at, exactly.
Where is it?
