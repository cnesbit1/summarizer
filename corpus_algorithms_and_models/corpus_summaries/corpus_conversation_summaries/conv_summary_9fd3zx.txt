No matter what the deal is the left will say it was give and take and the right will cry like babies that we were fucked over.
Even though the leadership has indicated they would bend over and spread.
Just hold out on signing a new deal until a change in American government.
A few years of shitty tariff battles is better than signing a bad deal indefinitely.
Is that an actual Avenue we could take?
As far as I’m aware, yes.
Trump isn’t allowed to drop the deal so he must continue to negotiate, but we aren’t obligated to sign anything unless we want to.
We can hold out for as long as we want.
Typical rational conservative discussion on trudeau.

The CPC has stated straight up they would just do as they are told (by Trump).
Trudeau has stated that Canada he will fight get a fair deal.
Personally I believe both groups.
