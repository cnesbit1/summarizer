Not sure who i want to win in the main event.
Both fighters have been respectful and professional so i don't want to see either of them lose.
I predict Woodley to win via decision though.
I also like both guys.
But I'm going for Woodley for a few reasons though, all of which basically come down to the fact that I think it's better for the sport if he wins.
* We don't need a WW champ who can't make WW without going to great length and compromising his health.
* Too much turnover of belts makes things way harder to follow and hurts the sport.
Currently, there's only two male UFC champs with multiple defenses.
One is DC at LHW, who may well never fight at LHW again and likely will retire within months.
And the other is TWood.
I think it's better for the UFC if he retains.
We don't want to get to a place where there are casual fans who haven't seen most champs fight.
* I don't think Colby is a draw.
I think all the data suggests the opposite, but to the extent that he has any heat and can, going forward, generate additional interest in the WW division, he has a way better chance of doing that challenging TWood.
* Extreme weight cutting is mma's disgusting blight.
It's good that Till made weight but if this week was even remotely close to what we saw in that video from his last cut, I'd like to see him move up.
So I think it's better if TWood wins.
Those are good points.
I think you need to re-evaluate your first point.
Woodley has looked AWFUL at his last two weigh ins.
Till’s “excuse” for missing weight against Thompson clearly had some truth since he was pretty easily able to get to 169.
Woodley would benefit from a 175lb division.
Who says it was easy?
If you watched embedded weight has fucking consumed this dude's life for well over a week.
Also vs Wonderboy was not Till's first miss in the UFC.
He missed by 5 pounds in 2017.
Plus that video of his cutting is fucking disgusting.
And yes, if you wanna just talk eye test, he did look bad this week.
And he was concerned about have to weigh in at 188 on fight day against Wonderboy.
Etc...

You can suggest TWood also has issues making 170, but to suggest based on the evidence available that he has more issues than Till is ridiculous.
Even tho i agree, I don't see Woodley making WW anymore longer after this fight.
He struggles with the cut too.
I don’t think Till is long for welterweight but he’s had what I would consider legitimate reasons for missing weight.
We’ve seen Till make weight with no issue against Cerrone and now again against Woodley, it’s just more fun to circlejerk about him missing weight while being so bombastic about his size.
Woodley has never missed weight but that doesn’t mean it’s somehow a healthier cut for him than it is for Till.
Aldo never missed weight at featherweight but he clearly has difficulty with the process.
You keep saying "without issue" and "pretty easily" and things that have no connection to reality.
Watch Till's interviews from this week.
He's asked how the cut is going.
He never says without issue or easy.
He says it's fucking terrible and hard and challenging and all that.
He made weight.
He didn't make it pretty easily.
Unless he's just full of shit and going so far as to stage performances on embedded and stuff to support the joke.
Which, I suppose, is possible, but it is not at all likely.
He also doesn't have a different body in the closet at home.
He's got the same body that he has when he missed twice in his last four fights (by multiple pounds both times).
So I believe all the evidence and his own version of events that it wasn't easy.
It's possible he's just trolling, but the alternative is incredibly more likely: it wasn't easy.
Could you link the video of tills cut?
I think the original was taken down but this might be it, on mobile so I can't check myself.
You can also go back and read many articles and a thread on here describing it

Thx M8.

Summary: 
He struggles with the cut too.
He's asked how the cut is going.
I also like both guys.
I think it's better for the UFC if he retains.
Also vs Wonderboy was not Till's first miss in the UFC.
So I think it's better if TWood wins.
* I don't think Colby is a draw.
And the other is TWood.
