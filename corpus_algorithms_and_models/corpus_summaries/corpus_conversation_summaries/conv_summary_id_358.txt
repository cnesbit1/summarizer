Original Response: 
I owe this subreddit a large apology, I have not been the moderator I could have been.
Because of things beyond my control, I have not been able to plan the meet ups and such you deserve.In order to rectify this situation, I have added TSW89 in as a mod.
The only way to describe the guy is: he rocks.
I probably added him at the wrong time, as he as recently become busy with a few things, but I am completely certain he is going to be an amazing mod.
So please, everyone, welcome Mr. TSW89.
:))
Welcome!
I thought this place was abandoned.
I'm in the midst of graduating and moving.
I totally apologize.
Not a lot of attention in this subreddit...
I guess there aren't many [READAHS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uvs2g5Nj0NI) around these parts?
Well, this *is* Corpus, after all.
24 years and I'm still not used to it haha.
