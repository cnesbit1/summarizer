Original Response:
Most marine life won't have a problem.  Fish swim a little deeper.  They are generally keep away from surf zones, if the zone gets bigger they move out and down.  

In extreme winds the surface of the water turns to a froth layer a couple of metres thick, "too thin to swim in and too thick to breathe" according to my old oceanography lecturer.  Sea mammals can't breathe would drown.  They may be able to get to land and head inshore. 

Things get really bad where the water meets the land.  Here an enormous amount of wave energy gets dissipated destroying all sorts of stuff.  Many thing die.

Sea birds can't cope with this very well.  Old Navy sailor friend told me that you know when you are in a really bad storm when an albatross lands on the deck.

I'm no but expert but albatrosses typically only land to breed right? So they can go years without landing.
Neither am I expert on this subject, but I don't think a bird could go years whithout landing somewhere. I agree that albatrosses can fly for an enormous distance, but they have to eat and sleep too (however I think some birds are able to sleep while flying, and sea mammals swim and sleep at the same time).
Their longest journeys are about 46 days. They are incredibly designed to minimize energy usage

They land on the water, but typically will spend 5 years at sea before stepping back on land to breed the first time. Not sure about successive years after that.

That must be what I was thinking.

Maybe that's where the superstition of sailors comes from -- cause and effect were a bit more shaky back when.
The word is aerosol, microscopic droplets of liquid suspended in the air. Youre probably familiar with it being used for something like hairspray, but its also commonly used to describe the ocean.

Would dolphins and whales drown?

This is also what makes surfing in huge waves extra dangerous. Tour guide in Hawaii was telling our group, with the frothy surface, surfers have to hold their breath for a couple minutes if they go down since the surface won't be breathable for at least that long after a big swell.
&lt;looks around feverishly&gt; ... what superstition?
You can breathe before a couple minutes after going down. Maybe your instructor was talking about hurricane sized waves. A couple minutes is a very long time to not be able to breathe and people would die all the time if that were the case.

Edit: especially when you are doing a strenuous activity. Try running 100 meters then holding your breath for two minutes and see how that works out.

If I was on a ship and an Albatross landed on the deck, I would be very concerned regardless if we were in good weather or not that would not be a good sign..
What about manatees?
What about cows &amp; chickens?
I forget the figure but I'm talking about specifically Mavericks/big waves that would be equivalent to storm waves elsewhere. I couldn't do that, but I'm also not a professional big wave surfer, although one time I fell off my board while I was paddling out, so basically the same thing.

I assume he's referring to the albatross. There's an old superstition that it's bad luck to kill an albatross (though wikipedia notes that this is a myth and sailors regularly killed and ate them). The superstition derived from a belief that an albatross was the wandering soul of a dead sailor.
I know a dude on ig named Miami skin diver that can hold his breath for about 5 mins while swimming FAST while spearfishing. Def not as hard as you’d think, and training is definitely possible

Even if you’re running 100m you’re not holding your breath the whole time. 2-3 breaths, slowly exhale and keep your core tight.

Clearly if an albatross lands on your ship you should kill it and hang it about your neck.
Just using it as an example. I’m a pretty new diver (on my second year) I can hold for about 2.30-2.48 at around 30 feet. And also a fair comparison since nobody is surfing MASSIVE hurricane waves as a beginner.

Can you explain this please? I’m not native speaker.

The surfer can’t breath because of the water in the air after the big wave?
At least you could console yourself with the idea that eventually a wedding guest will rise sadder and wiser on the morrow morn.
They're talking about a froth some meters deep on the surface, not a fine spray or airborne particles above the surface.

The surfer can’t get through the foam, the foam’s  density is too low to support a Human.  The surfer cannot breath in the foam either.

Had the same thing kayaking on the Nile.

I don’t know why, but the image of a manatee in the beach just chilling and not giving a crap about a Cat 4 hurricane raging around them is kind of amusing. Does the larger flaying degree not pose a threat to them?  Like boards and such?

What about sea sponges and starfish?
Because albatrosses for for years at a time without ever landing, and are massive. Suddenly you're in a confined space with a gigantic, distressed bird.
Oh, now I understood! Thanks for the explanation!
[removed]
I mean in theory yeah but it’s ultimately a story so it’s hard to apply real world logic to it.
The froth, as you described it, is the same danger posed by underwater volcanoes where the water above them may have decreased density due to the release of gasses from the volcano. The water may look fine but may not support a ship.

Is that a similar effect to pumping air through a swimming pool full of sand? Making it so you can move through the sand as if it were water?
Do they have trouble walking on land? I imagine if they’ve only been flying and floating for 5 years then their legs are probably not in great walking shape, right?
I don't think that is true unless the water has some sort of contaminant. This is Nazare one of the bigger waves in the world.

There is a lot of foam but the guy's head is clearly visible and clear of the water. 

Surfers do get held underwater by large successive waves sometimes but it's not the foam on the surface that causes them to drown, it's another wave and the circular hydraulics of the waves.

I've been held under surfing, it's scary but you are well below the surface of the water.
Maybe it's both? Sort of a "blurred line" where there's more air in the water and more water in the air? I can't find any information on the froth they're talking about.
[removed]
Yes. They do the same thing with swimming pools that are used for really high diving, there's a system of air pipes on the bottom that inject a ton of bubbles right as you're diving so that the surface turns into a froth. It breaks up the surface tension so that you don't splat so hard.
I don't know about the technical term, but they do the same thing with swimming pools that are used for really high diving, there's a system of air pipes on the bottom that inject a ton of bubbles right as you're diving so that the surface turns into a froth.

There would be aerosols in the voids within the froth, but the majority of the structure they're talking about isn't an aerosol.
Cavitation?

*the formation of an empty space within a solid object or body.*

* the formation of bubbles in a liquid, typically by the movement of a propeller through it.

Does this still happen when the hurricane is out in the middle of the ocean? Do Sperm Whales have to get out of the path of hurricanes? Or does this mostly effect more coastal mammals like seals?
Could this be a reason why breaching behavior evolved as opposed to purely for play?
It’s also a theory on why places like the Bermuda Triangle have so many ships disappear.  The theory is that there’s a massive methane vent on the ocean floor.  When a large pocket of gas is released and reaches the surface the density of the water drops so low that boats can no longer float and appear to just vanish.

I've never heard of a cow that was swimming around in a hurricane drown
Depends on if it is sessile (attached) or mobile, and a dozen other factors. In Florida Bay, we tend to see the water literally get sucked out between the Florida Keys if the storm passes to the west. This exposes everything on the bottom and, if it’s long enough, itlll die. 

We saw massive sponge die offs due to this [ETA: after Irma]. Hurricanes also move a ton of sentiment at times, which can scour the bottom life, or bury it, or just remain suspended and “choke out” corals and sponges and sea grasses by denying their ability to photosynthesize or suspension feed efficiently. 

There were many reports of small fish kills due to surge pushing them up on land, again these were mostly the little critters that hide near the bottom nearshore (catfish, pin fish, sea horses, etc), not so much larger snapper or tuna or things like that. Lots of conch, sea stars, urchins, etc were washed ashore.
In America you call starfish, sea stars... Really? :O

Could be an American-Southernism -- don't think I've heard anyone call them that myself :o

Thanks for the breakup of the sea life kills that happen. As a follow-up q, if sponges and small fish are killed in large numbers in a hurricane, do you know of any study or observation of larger fish and predators migrating away for a while till the stocks get rejuvenated?

Proper nomenclature is sea stars. Starfish is incorrect but fairly common.
[removed]
In the Netherlands we do too. There's quite some dutchisms that have spread over to American as well as British English. Especially nautical terms.
"Marine scientists have undertaken the difficult task of replacing the beloved starfish’s common name with sea star because, well, the starfish is not a fish. It’s an echinoderm, closely related to sea urchins and sand dollars." - [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/group/starfish/)

No. We do not call them sea stars. Maybe some people in academia do... but commonly they are called starfish. 

Evidence:  

*  Wikipedia search for sea star redirects to starfish.  
* Look up Patrick from Spongebob. They call him a starfish, not a sea star.  
* Google search for starfish has 40 million results, Google search for sea star has 1.2 million results.
