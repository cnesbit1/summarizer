So, for a bit of explanation: A recent post on this subreddit got me thinking, it was something about a player who described his adventures with his character. I found that odd, as I always play **as** my character, not **with**. If you play with your character, you view him or her more like a puppet or maybe a puppy. You tell it what you want and hope it does it correctly. As a result, there is a disconnection between master and puppet. On the other hand, if you play as your character, your more like an actor, imaging yourself as your character. Itâ€™s more like playing D&amp;D. A discussion with my wife revealed that she also seems to play with her character. So this got we wondering, how many player out there play like this? I guess a majority never even thinks about this stuff and just wants the biggest numbers or the most flashiest shinnies on their characters, but for those out there who care, here is a short poll to find out who wins: The puppet masters or the actors: https://www.strawpoll.me/16513950
No matter what game I play, I play **as** my character.  If I don't/can't relate to them, I don't enjoy the game as much and can't really get invested in it.
That is why I only have Male humans as characters. I can't identify myself to other races so I usually abandon those characters. The only non human character I have is a Charr and that's because my headcanon for him is that he's a human who got shapeshifted by a curse
Oh my god, same for me, although it's the female human meta. I just prefer the voice and I guess it's easier for me to relate to?
In WoW, I primarily play female characters but here in GW2, I've got three female and two male - female Norn, Sylvari and Human; male Sylvari and Human.  I tried Charr and Asura and just didn't like playing those races.
Same with Human Males.I tried getting into Sylvari, Asura and Charr but I just feel completely disconnected from them.
I'm male but play a female human, can confirm its possible to play as someone different than you while staring at a  female's ass.
I hate the fact that I can't play a Silvari because their dance is so friggin' awesome
I honestly could not care less about a fictional ass aha. My best buddy from GW2 can't understand that
I used to think that. Then I didn't.
Yeah, the whole "may as well look at a cute ass" excuse always felt weak to me. How boring is the game, and how horny are you that you constantly need pixelated ass to enjoy playing a game?

As for races, I stick to human male most of the time, but I do have one male Sylvari, because I *really* wanted to make a samurai with the mushroom head.
Same. I usually stick to human male most of the time, but I do have *one* male Sylvari, because I really wanted to make a samurai Warrior with the mushroom head.
It's fun to look at cute girls and be able to make the supreme cute girl throughout your story tbh

Also in like 99% of MMOs you choose either "hardened, grizzled male warrior" or "attractive, soft female non-combatant" type characters
Same here, though I can put myself in any of the humanoid races.

I made an asura character recently, really enjoying the animation and feel of the character (asura do a cute little arm flail when jumping!), and love the lore of the asura, but am finding it much harder to inhabit the character like I usually do with human, sylvari or norn characters.
Yep, I'm the very same. It's why I have a hard time playing games where I can't make my own characters. If I don't feel attached to them I enjoy myself considerably less.  

Although I've never RP'd, I do still put a lot of work in to writing the story for my characters and thinking about their personalities and such. I don't have any difficulty connecting to characters of different races, genders or even species as long as I'm content with how they look and the story I've made for them.
How do you deal with the frequent poor decision making? WOuld you also make similarly bad decisions?
I can't relate with being human so I play other races. (I'm Autistic)
I understand, playing an other race is also a way to try and be different
I tend to be cautious and risk-averse IRL but my characters are braver (and a touch more reckless) than me.  They are reflections of how I wish I could be but they do make some pretty dumb decisions like charging in to slash and bash a monster that's bigger and stronger and getting their butts whooped.
My main is a male Norn because I just thought they were big humans (like Vikings or something like that). I like to imagine myself as a big, strong guy on this fantasy world because IRL I cant be that :c
Don't be too shocked by the following: You don't need to be, nor are you necessarily "horny" for looking at a "cute ass" of a video game character. I play female characters if they look "better" (subjective, of course) than their male counterpart and vice versa. I play female Sylvari/Human and sometimes Asura because I really enjoy their voice actresses, same for male Sylvari.

In WoW, I used to play female human as I liked the character look better, but played both genders for Night Elves, etc. And now the shocker: All of that without a single horny thought! This is not Blade and Soul (which you may or may not call over the top on the fanservice front) ;)

Summary:
That is why I only have Male humans as characters.
I can't relate with being human so I play other races.
I tried Charr and Asura and just didn't like playing those races.
I used to think that.
No matter what game I play, I play **as** my character.
