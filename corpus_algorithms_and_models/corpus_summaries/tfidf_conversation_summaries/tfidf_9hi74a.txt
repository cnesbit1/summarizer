[event] Looking for someone willing to RNG shinies of my request. RNG'd Shinies must have proof pls.
Hello! I have Wind Lugia codes. Would you be interested in trading your Poipole codes?
whats your rating?
I'm looking for 1:10. Will it be alright?
Im alright with that rate, but I'll have to gather more codes. is it ok if you can hold on this deal?
Sure!
Still gathering codes, I apologize if im taking too long as there is flooding in my area which makes it difficult to get them. I almost have enough codes for the deal. Are you still interested in doing the deal btw?
It is okay! I'm not in rush to get the codes anyway, I'm hoping that you're doing better despite the flooding
