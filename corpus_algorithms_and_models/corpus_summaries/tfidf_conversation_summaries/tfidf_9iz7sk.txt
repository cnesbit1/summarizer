Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Edson barboza with some ring craft would be a world beater.  Nganou with a double leg takedown, Carlos condit with a heavy right straight.  Any other simple fixes for elite fighters?
Mark Hunt with impeccable submission defense
Mark Hunt with ratfuck repellent
A Curtis Blaydes that works off his jab instead of just throwing it
Lmao
Demian Maia with a wicked kicking game was always my dream
CM Punk with martial arts skill
Edson is an athletic freak. Would love to see him go at Ferguson again since that first fight he got rocked by Tony's illegal kick on the ground.
Tony with IQ
Khabib with Saenchai's striking.
Aldo with elite stamina would be close to unbeatable. 

Rockhold with takedown ability.
The Diaz lads with proper kick defense.
He uses his one free eye poke really well. Thatâ€™s intelligent

Summary:
**[Welcome to rMMA's General Discussion Thread!
Mark Hunt with impeccable submission defense.
