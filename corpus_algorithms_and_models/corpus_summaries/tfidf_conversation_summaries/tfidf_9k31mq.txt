Original Response:
I love Reddit and I generally love the people here, but lately I have been feeling largely like I am intruding on a community that doesn’t want or respect me. It’s starting to feel more and more like Reddit hates women and has no problem attacking women like a mob. Especially with the Kavanaugh hearings, I have been astonished at seeing almost every single top comment about the subject being in support of Kavanaugh. So many men are defending him and acting like a rape accusation is worse than actually being raped. I’ve been going through posts and comments all week and feeling like I don’t belong here due to the men expressing their desire to defend rapists. 

I am just curious if I’m the only woman feeling this way lately, or ever. I feel like there is no point in even commenting on these matters because the men of Reddit will attack me.
Reddit isn't a fucking person ..
where did I say that
Her point is that there is an overwhelming amount of very defensive men (with regards to sexual assault, who effectively attack even allegations which is effectively but probably inadvertently  akin to taking a pro-assault stance). Most of all these men lurk specifically on women subs .
And my point is Reddit isn't one fucking person....
Well congrats on that revelation. Did you also know that 2 + 2 is 4? Just putting it out there 

😹😹

For real tho

HOO SAID REDDIT WAS 1 PERSON LMAO
"Reddit hates women"

Learn to read and write.
Learn the art of nuance ...
Did you see who wrote that, kid?

At least I embarrassed you out of writing like one...
&gt; Reddit hates women

And that's how you're acting when you say "Reddit does this and Reddit does that"... It's not a fucking person.
why are you so angry about me saying “Reddit” instead of “the men on Reddit” lmao
Because I'm not seeing what you are and you're pretending like Reddit has one thought.... Now it's all men that are at fault. Please.
“not all men”, what a timeless classic.

Summary:
where did I say that.
I feel like there is no point in even commenting on these matters because the men of Reddit will attack me.
