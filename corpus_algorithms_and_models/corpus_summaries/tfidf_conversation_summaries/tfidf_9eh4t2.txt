I have a lot of evolutionary stones and other evolution items. Which ones in particular are you looking for?

I am looking for Heart Scales, do you have any of those? They can be stolen from wild Luvdisc.
In looking for literally every stone and I need the evo items for spritzee and it's counterpart (can't think of the name) and I can get them how many are you looking for?
I can get the heart scales if there was any confusion in the last reply
No confusion at all :) I am looking for as many heart scales as you are willing to get me. I don't have the evo items for Spritzee and Swirlix, but I have multiples of basically everything else, except for Up-Grade and Dubious Disc. I can make you a list of how many I have of each, but it might take me a little while.
Which stones do you have, I may not be able to reply for a little bit but I can use that time to get heart scales.
Okay, so here's what I've got:

* Fire Stone x25
* Water Stone x17
* Leaf Stone x17
* Thunder Stone x26
* Moon Stone x10
* Sun Stone x15
* Shiny Stone x8
* Dusk Stone x11
* Dawn Stone x5
* Deep Sea Scale x5
* Deep Sea Tooth x5
* Electirizer x5
* Magmarizer x11
* Metal Coat x1
* Oval Stone x19
* Razor Claw x6
* Razor Fang x7

I am happy to trade any of these 1:1 for Heart Scales, if that works for you? And no worries if it takes a while to get the Heart Scales. I'm not in any sort of hurry.
I would like 1 thunder stone 1 water stone 2 leaf stones 1 fire stone 2 shiny stones and a sun stone please.
Tell me when you are able to trade

Okay, I just added your FC and am heading online.
Did I miss one? I noticed you had an extra heart scale at the end, there.
A leaf stone
Wait
A moon stone
Thanks for the trade!
