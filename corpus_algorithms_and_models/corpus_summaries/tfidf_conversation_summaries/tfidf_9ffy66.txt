Original Response:
Lots of triangles in that frame. What a machine, lean and hungry, beautifully engineered, brutally powerful. A bike to dream of.
Brutally powerful? It's a 750SS base so not really :P
Haha, yeah, no :)
With that light frame 750 is plenty. This is real engineering not some hairy chested engine with wheels. A bike to make the heart sing on a twisty road, not to burn impressive quarter-mile times.
It's got 66HP.... sure it's plenty but definitely not brutal power
“A bike to make the heart sing on a twisty road, not to burn impressive quarter-mile times like those idiot Chad-bikes. While all the S1000RR’s and Hyabusas of the world were out partying, this REAL bike studied the blade. This is a REAL bike, that will protect your heart by all means necessary...”

FTFY
Lol seriously? That's not even noteworthy these days, let alone brutal
Everybody knows the fewer your CCs the smaller your PP.

I've got a '92 750SS and you're right it's not the most powerful thing on the block. But the frame and the bike are the same size as a 250. So yeah, you really only need 66 horses, it flies and will keep up with a lot of modern stuff.
Du...Ducati-san?
TIL Leader Bikes can’t turn well.

I'd like to know the weight. Power to weight is a bigger deal than outright power. A dirtbike can be a 40hp thrill with only 220 lbs to move

Summary:
A bike to dream of.
A bike to make the heart sing on a twisty road, not to burn impressive quarter-mile times.
