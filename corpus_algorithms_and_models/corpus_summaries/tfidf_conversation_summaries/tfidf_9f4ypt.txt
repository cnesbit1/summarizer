Original Response:
It's clear that many religious people *choose* which scientific consensuses to accept. It's not uncommon for religious people to fully accept and even praise certain aspects of science, such as achievements in physics and medicine, but reject others, such as certain consensuses in biology and geology (e.g., evolution). Why is this, and, if you are religious and do this yourself, how do you objectively justify it?
