Original Response:
**Quick disclaimer:** I did not get my account deleted yet, so I don't know exactly how KFT will react or respond. I will be requesting deletion as soon as ANET says if we (non-us peeps) can still get our stuff (I contacted them about it)... I suggest you do the same, because repetitive requests invoking any of these rights might be rejected, so only request deletion when you are sure you will not need the account anymore.

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is this European regulation that forces companies that deal with European customers (or more specifically, with their data) to jump through extra hoops when dealing with personal data AND gives you a couple of useful rights. **Feel free to skip ahead.**

First set of rights is the right to request information about what data is being collected, for what purpose and how it is processed (if any automatic processing is done; In this context "Processing" is more of a profiling/statistics and such. This includes the process of collecting/storing data - thanks to  [lelo1248](https://www.reddit.com/user/lelo1248) for pointing that out.)

Second one is to request a copy of all personal information. This one is a bit tricky, because in some cases they will consider some data irrelevant and you might need to request specific data and and prove that the data you are requesting is within the scope of personal data protected by GDPR. Feel free to look through [this long post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bladeandsoul/comments/8riewj/gdpr_data_requests_in_mmos_one_scenario_ban_and/) if you want to find read about a specific case of a tricky data request.

The most relevant one to most of you right now will be the **right of erasure** (a.k.a. "right to be forgotten" ), which allows you to request your deletion of your account or personal details. Some companies support outright deletion, while others only offer deletion of personal information (so they might depersonalize the data you generated by using a company's service).

One thing to note about 2 of the latter rights is the requests might be refused if on legally justifiable grounds (that might include your obligations, the company's obligations or lack of technical means to accomplish it, but not "we do not have an API for that" ). 2 Basic examples are: companies may omit how their security systems process your personal data; they might also refuse to delete/depersonalize your account if you have obligations to that company (for instance a loan, or if you worked for it).

# General guidelines, for account deletion, that should work with most companies:

**Luckily for us none of those restrictions (to my knowledge) apply in KFTs case.** If you only want your account (and/or personal data) deleted  you may simply write an email saying that you want to  exercise your right under the GDPR and get your account and all personal data associated with it deleted (if you write from the same email you registered with you can word it like this "I would like account associated with email I am writing from deleted".  If they comply your it ends there, but I suspect it will not.

**As far as I know it does not matter if you are from EU**. As a commercial company that allows EU users to register, they have to comply with GDPR or risk getting fines. To my knowledge they are not allowed to offer different rights (discriminate) their customers based on region without branching their business, which means non-eu users get the rights too.

**They might ask you to prove your identity**, but companies can only to request information that is necessary to determine who you are in scope of these requests. Based on that I can conclude that your email (username in their app) should be sufficient, if you write from same email you registered with.

**If they tell you that your account will be depersonalized and not deleted,** remember your account has an email as a username. Be sure to ask that they remove that too.

**If they refuse your request** ask for a legal justification and make sure to repeat something in lines of "If you have no legal justification for denying my request, please delete my account". If that happens I might write up a more specific response.

If you run into other trouble that is not listed here, comment and if I see it I will try to respond.
Has anyone bothered to stop and consider the fact that what you're doing is going to guarantee that Arenanet never does another promotion like this?
Why does it? Were not attacking Arenanet with GDPR requests.. though we could but it would achieve nothing of any value to us. Hitting this company with legal requests to remove our data so it cannot be sold over a botched promotion were they just wanted YOUR PERSONAL DATA TO SELL ill emphasise that part. THEN they removed said reward was just like getting your face spat in. 

&amp;#x200B;

All EU Citizens are well within there right to hit anyone with a GDPR request if they so feel its warranted.

Why should someone be able to buy my data to try sell me a product i don't want? To email me, to send junk mail to my house because i signed up to some shitty app?

&gt; Why does it?

KFT has spent money for a promotion which will provide you with a free item within GW2 in exchange for your contact information for marketing purposes. You entered into that transaction fully aware of what was required from you and what you would receive in exchange. You're then advocating the use of the GPDR to strip that contact information from KFT. Beyond the fact that what you're doing is frankly fraud by any definition of contract law, no other company is going to be willing to partner with Arenanet on any promotions if any significant portion of the user base follows your advice.
You may want to check into GDPR Usage in europe and the law my friend

&amp;#x200B;

Currently under EU Law in GDPR the collection of personal data for competitions, giveaways and the likes has ALOT of things you must do, Kungfu tea did none of those. A policy must be in place, a full complaints procedure and a direct contact to there data controller must also be in place, Full and open consent must also be gained with a reason of WHY your collecting said data.

&amp;#x200B;

Correct me if im wrong but Kungfu Tea have broken alot of rules in this sense and will likely get a very big fine for doing so. 

Fraud by contract law? Your having a laugh right.. Get some law books before trying that
you missed the part where the free item is no longer available to non-US users, which is why EU players are upset, and subsequently want their information deleted using the EU GDPR.
If anything this should make ArenaNnet contribute to their partners having clear language  in their promotions, that clearly states the terms, so we don't end up with a huge portion of game population feeding some **unknown 3rd party company** personal information, waste a lot of time and then end up getting polite spit in the face in return. "Sorry for not empathizing it was US only" essentially implies it was stated and we misunderstood it ) . I honestly, wouldn't bother with the promo or engage in this salt mine if they were consistent and did 1 of the 3 things:

* State outright that promotion is for US only. Sure I'd be sad, but games have done much worse with promos.
* Issue an apology  on day 1 (or as soon as you notice there are thousands of non-US people flooding the app) and say that the whole promotion is only meant for US citizens
* Deliver on their initial promise (dlc is free for all and sweepstakes are limited to us)
&gt;You entered into that transaction fully aware of what was required from you and what you would receive in exchange.

&amp;#x200B;

They entered into that transaction fully aware of what was required from them and what we would receive in exchange.

Yet - they haven't fulfilled their part (not in actually getting us what hey promised, nor in preparing properly for handling data from the EU, which we can expect), so if people want to bow out and want their data removed it is their full right.

&amp;#x200B;
Oh, you were there in the meeting? Can you tell is how much KFT paid for this promotion or are you just pulling random assumptions out of the sky?
KFT misadvertised their promotion to a serious degree. I feel no remorse requesting them to delete my data. Why would I let them have my data, which they will sell to advertisement companies and the likes, when I don't even get something in return? So that ANet looks better in the eyes of their promotion partners? As much as I like GW2, I have no binding loyalty to ANet in any shape or form. They are a big company, they will be able to take the small hit they may get from people requesting the deletion of their data. I am not their PR departement, nor do I own any shares in the company.
Couldn't of put it better. Whilst most if this promo was a success would of never of thought to GDPR request them both parties would have what they want and the few would of still of made sure to have there data removed or depersonalised. As you have wrote its the fact they have lied to us, changed the promo mid term whilst keeping our data which has annoyed so many.
If our actions can prevent another Kung Fu Trash disaster then all I can really say is onward march.
Yes, and that's exactly why people should go ahead with this.

This whole thing was a terrible decision and that much should be made clear.
