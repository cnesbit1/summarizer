I so hope you didnâ€™t really do this. Please be a troll.

The number of people she's had sex with doesn't effect anything.  
Say she only had one partner ever. And they had sex 10 times a week for 1 year . That's 520 times . Now imagine it was 7 different guysover her life . Having sex with them 3 or 4 times, maybe even 1 only once.  You are looking at having sex 28 times max!  Over a lifetime.  It's all relevant. 

Plus your "sex number" is some real high school shit.  If you are kicking a girl out because of a sex number she dodged a bullet  .
Okay, yet I saw you comment and say that you think sheâ€™s immature for lying. You donâ€™t think this is the epitome of immaturity? 

You arenâ€™t entitled to this information, sorry to break that to you. She probably lied because you were the one being immature by insisting you have a right to know how many guys are in her *past*. Myself, I would have just told you to fuck off and definitely would not have slept with you. Poor girl.

If she lied about something that actually mattered then I would be inclined to agree. Iâ€™m assuming here, but Iâ€™d be willing to bet you went about asking in a very dickish way as well. 

Whether she lied or not, you have zero right to post information like that about her. Thatâ€™s fucked up and wrong no matter how you spin it.
Awwww! You literally threw a tantrum!!!!
