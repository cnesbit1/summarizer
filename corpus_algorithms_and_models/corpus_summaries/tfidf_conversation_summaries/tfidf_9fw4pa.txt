I disagree with you. I think that's synonymous to saying that if we don't have any laws, then less people would do bad things.

Gotcha... Why do you think a religionless world would have less war?

Sodomites didn't fight eachother. The babylonians didn't fight themselves.
The raped each other and sacrificed their children.
So Planned Parenthood and Harvey Weinstein?
Yep
I don't.  People will always unite around something and use it as a reason to fight other people.  If religion isn't around it'd be something else.
The babylonians totally fought each other.
That is your take away?
One of the best things about Christianity is that it internally resists being turned into a tribal or ethnic totem.  Yes, it has been used that way, it has been a very common error, and the un-Biblical idea of 'Christendom' dies hard.  But we're told that ethnic divisions, local customs and foodways, and similar tribal markers are irrelevant to the Lord, even as we're told to be peacemakers.
Username checks out :)
People don't fight those who agree with them...
