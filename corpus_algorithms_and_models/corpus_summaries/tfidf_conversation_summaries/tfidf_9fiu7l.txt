Original Response:
It's almost like this website is controlled, manipulated, and toyed with.

When we have a documented, hate sub, that incites violence and encourages brigading and harrassing other users, not even get banned, it is obvious what is really going on with this shitty social platform.

Reddit is dying the death of a million shills, fake gate keepers, and paid discourse. What a shame this platform has become. Literally banning communities that preached peace and unity, only to become banned and blanket wiped. Meanwhile TMOR is untouched. Speaks volumes. Really does. Fuck you /u/spez and the shitty admins of this defunct dying website. You all have no spines and do not belong in America. Anerica has become a political battleground that is filled with censorship and divide and conquer strategies. Dark days ahead of us. The storm is now here.
If Reddit is stifling you, why not find a more "open minded" site?
because social media has been monopolized
Then make your own!
I cant, social media has been monopolized...
Monopoly of the people? Yes, most people would not no to a conspiracy site. Or do you mean they'll kill you if you try and make one? Buy servers? Set up databases?
Okay.......
so you see the problem then
they'll stop you from being able to compete
Is it possible to create something as popular as reddit with zero budget?

It seems a little bit foolish to just claim people can create what this was supposed to be without some kind of support system.
