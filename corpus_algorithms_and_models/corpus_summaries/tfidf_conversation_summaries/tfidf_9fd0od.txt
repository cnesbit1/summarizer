Hello!

I'm looking for a bunch of hard to find shop ball HA (SBHA) Pok√©mon. The list of what I am looking for is below, or you can check out the [Rare Shop Balls](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JQ7a2QecIqLbrNXwsz6gDd03Gd5jZorEwuhxgKtJnU/edit#gid=1083617329) tab of my spreadsheet. Basically, anything that's missing from that tab is something that I am looking for, but only if it comes with HA. I am also interested in shop ball gen 2 starters (which cannot have HA) and any DBHA I am missing.

For trade, I can offer any breedables from my collection (see my [gen 6 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16JQ7a2QecIqLbrNXwsz6gDd03Gd5jZorEwuhxgKtJnU/edit#gid=1354832787) or [gen 7 spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hg_WT4lif9HjPLpXVwPDTK5oth-FOiS9GIANF8wmBfY/edit#gid=1221275681)). I am willing to offer 3 breedables or 5 on-hands for each SBHA fossil/Snorlax/starter, and 1 breedable or 2 on-hands for other shop balls or DBHA. If you want gen 7 stuff, I can double those rates (since I won't have to worry about gender while breeding).

In general, I place a higher value on female Pok√©mon with a 12.5% female ratio, as they take significantly longer to breed (especially in combination with HA), so please keep that in mind when making offers. I do not value 12.5% females any less when I have them on-hand (since I never get so many of them that they are going to be a factor in me running out of box space).

And, finally, a big ol' list of what I want, what I have, and what's pending:

###Shop Ball 'mons

|Pok√©mon|**Want**|*Have*|Pending|

|HA Omanyte (12.5% F)|**Great, Ultra, Premier, Nest, Dive, Luxury, Dusk**|*Repeat, Net, Timer, Heal, Quick*||

Edit: Table updated September 18
I have 10 of the Pokemon you're looking for:4 Fossils, 4 Starters, and a Kangaskhan and a Qwilfish. All female with HA and most have 4 EM's and all onhand. Most of my collections are complete. What I'm looking for are the new USUM Eggmoves and HA Vivillon's in Apriballs.(All patterns except Modern). I can send a list of the Pokemon and EM's I'm looking for if you think you might have any to trade.
If I don't have them, I can try to get them. I am willing to go pretty far out of my way to get the Pok√©mon I am looking for, so I will happily breed or hunt down whatever you are looking for :)

I don't currently have any apriball HA Scatterbugs/Vivillons, but one of my Vivillon patterns is High Plains (the other being Modern, sadly). I will have to check which pattern I have on which of my games, but I can at least theoretically get you some of the Vivillons you are looking for.
That sounds great! When I get home from work later today, I'll send that list of Pokemon/USUM EM's I'm looking for. I'm also willing to breed more of the 12.5% female fossils or starters to trade 1:1 for the Vivillon's.
I looked better at the Pokemon I have on hand and can definitely send you these:

Anorith in Dive, Net, Heal balls

Omanyte in Heal ball

Kangaskhan in Heal ball

Qwilfish in Net ball

Cyndaquil in Net ball 

All are female, HA (except Cyndaquil), and 4 EM's.

Here is my [LIST](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydFwuIaReRdwkPbfHa64DVLYHfqg_2CdbfbSFyHC_Kk/edit?usp=drivesdk) that shows the Pokemon and USUM exclusive Egg Moves I am looking for.

I also have every Pokemon on your want list, so I can breed some for those Vivillon's if you're willing to get them for me.
Awesome. I'm interested in all of those except the Qwilfish. What sort of trade ratio of shop ball Pok√©mon to USUM egg moves are you looking for?
1:1
Okay. I will plan on breeding the following to trade for your on-hands:

1. Koffing with Venom Drench
2. Spiritomb with Disable
3. Tepig with Burn Up
4. Scraggy with Acid Spray
5. Yamask with Crafty Shield
6. Pyukumuku with Spite

Do you care what gender these are? Or any other details?
No other preference. Just the Pokemon and the move. Thanks!
I finished breeding your Pok√©mon :)
Great! I have yours ready as well. I just need to get some trash Pokemon in gen 7 ready. Will you be able to trade in about 15 minutes? We can start with gen 6, then move to gen 7.
Sure, let me just find some junkmons.

Edit: Junkmons found.
Thanks for the trades! Let me know if you're willing to get those Vivillon's for me. I'll breed 1 for 1 any of the ones left on your list that you want!
Thanks for the trade!

I still need to check which Vivillon patterns I have on which games, but I will let you know.
üëç
So, turns out I have High Plains pattern on my UM :)

I still need to acquire some apriball Scatterbugs for breeding, though, so it might take me a while to get you HA apriball Vivillons.

How do you like your Vivillons? Do you want a particular nature or anything? Do you prefer them as eggs, or fully evolved?
If possible, Female, HA, Timid, Fully Evolved. Which of the Pokemon do you want me to breed for you?
Can do. I don't have a good estimate of how long it will take, but I will keep you updated on progress.

I am interested in your:

1. Timer Lileep
2. Timer Shieldon
3. Timer Kangaskhan
4. Timer Snorlax
5. Timer Chikorita
6. Timer Cyndaquil
7. Timer Totodile
I understand. It will also take me some time to get these bred for you. I'll let you know when they're ready.
Cool. Don't worry if it takes a while. I'm quite familiar with how long it can take to breed these, and I don't mind waiting.

Also, I found someone to get a full set of 3EM Timid HA apriball Monsoon Scatterbugs from. Would you also be interested in that set, after I level them up a bit and use them to breed a set of High Plains Vivillons? And how important is it that they be female? Is it okay if one set is all females, and the other is whatever?
Yes, I would like the Monsoon set as well. I prefer female but it's much more important that they have HA, be Timid and have the Apriballs. What would you like for those 7?
Okay. How about:

1. Timer Sentret
2. Timer Qwilfish
3. Timer Burmy
4. Timer Hippopotas
5. Timer Basculin (Red)
6. Timer Basculin (Blue)
7. Timer Shelmet
üëç
So, just to keep you updated, I got in the set of apriball HA Timid Monsoon Scatterbugs, and now I just need to breed them, and then evolve both that set and the bred High Plains one.
Great. I still have 3 to breed for you. How about we trade this weekend if you're finished by then?
Sounds good!
Your Vivillons are ready :) Four of the Monsoon ones are male, but all the rest are females (and of course, all HA, Timid and in apriballs).

This weekend still looks good for trading.
Great! I'll be ready, and I'm available all weekend.
So, I found someone to get a set of apriball HA Timid female Icy Snow Vivillons from, if you are interested in trading more gen 6 shop ball 'mons for those? Also, do you care what level the Vivillons are?
That would be great! I'm definitely interested. No, I don't care what level the Vivillon's are. What do you want in return? I have your Pokemon for our trade. Are you available to trade anytime soon?
Yea, I can trade any time in the next five hours. Do you care about trade order? I can do whatever.

For the Icy Snow Vivillons, I am interested in your:

1. Ultra Tirtouga
2. Nest Tirtouga
3. Repeat Tirtouga
4. Dusk Tirtouga
5. Nest Kangaskhan
6. Repeat Kangaskhan
7. Dusk Kangaskhan
I'm breeding Pokemon in gen 6 right now, so let's start there. I'll get online. I'll breed those for you but it will probably be tomorrow afternoon or Sunday before they're ready. I'm breeding for another trade and have about 15 more to breed. I'll see you online!
That's fine. It'll probably be a few days before I get the Icy Snow Vivillons in.

I'll head online now :)
Thank you so much for the trade. Talk to you soon! :)
Thanks so much!

I'm really excited about all my new shop ball stuff :D
So, I just found someone to get Garden HA apriball Vivillons from :)

It might be something like a week before I get them, though. I'm guessing I'll get the Icy Snow ones in 1-3 days.
Sounds good. I'm breeding your Tirtouga's right now. Keep me posted! The more the better! :)
Awesome :D

I'll keep looking for more Vivillons \^.^
üëç
Oh, just FYI. A friend of mine is getting me a full set of Sun Pattern Vivillon's, so don't look for those. I really appreciate your help getting these for me!
Thanks for the heads up :)

I really appreciate you trading me all the shop ball stuff (I've had *such* a hard time finding all these!), so that works out quite well for both of us :D
A couple of years ago when xy and then oras came out, there were quite a few of us breeding and trading them. I kept them in gen 6 even though the breeding is a lot more difficult because it seems that they lose their uniqueness if moved to gen 7. I hope you're getting a set of these Vivillon's as well. When the games change over to the Switch console later this year, I think they will be harder to get as people's focus changes.
I definitely kept myself a set of apriball Scatterbugs, but I'm less interested in the Vivillons since I can't breed more of a pattern. I'm sure they will be harder to get when the Switch games come out, but breedables are my top priority at the moment.
Oh yea, I should probably get you a request list for the Garden Vivillons.

How about:

1. Ultra Omanyte
2. Ultra Kabuto
3. Ultra Aerodactyl
4. Ultra Lileep
5. Ultra Anorith
6. Ultra Cranidos
7. Ultra Kangaskhan

No rush at all on these. Like I said before, it might be up to a week before I get the Garden Vivillons in (plus I am in general happy to wait when interesting shop ball 'mons are involved).
Sounds good! I have your Tirtougas and Kangaskhans ready for the Icy Snow Vivillon's. Let me know when you're ready to trade.
Awesome. I'm guessing I'll have the Icy Snow Vivillons in 1-2 days. I'll let you know when I get them in, or if it looks like they're going to take longer than expected.
Okay!
I ~~possibly~~ just found River Vivillons. ~~Still negotiating, though.~~
Just got Icy Snow Vivillons in :)
Are you available to trade? I'll be awake for another 2 hours or so. My work schedule this week is very busy, but hopefully I can get some breeding done.
Yea. I can trade now. Do you want to trade the gen 6 stuff or gen 7 first?

There's no rush on breeding. I don't mind waiting, and it will probably be a while before I get in the River or Garden Vivillons anyway.
Gen 6 first. I'll get online!
We have 1 more Kangaskhan to trade in gen 6!
Oops. No wonder you weren't in FP yet, lol XD

I'll hop back over to gen 6.
NP! :)
I see the reason I got confused, though. Was using a non-HA Kangaskhan as a junkmon lol.
Thanks for the trade!
Really not a problem! Thank you so much again. These Icy Snow Vivillon's are one of my favorite patterns! Have a great week and see you soon!
So, I ended up getting in the River Vivillons a lot earlier than I expected (well, mostly--had connection issues in the middle of the trade, and then my trade partner had to go sleep, but I'll get the rest of the set tomorrow).

Guess I should get you another request list. How about:

1. Great Kangaskhan
2. Great Omanyte
3. Great Kabuto
4. Great Aerodactyl
5. Dive Kangaskhan
6. Net Kangaskhan
7. Quick Kangaskhan

Let me know if I'm going too fast with getting these Vivillons. I know you said you were busy with work this week, and I don't want you to feel pressured to get stuff bred fast. I know fossils take a while, anyway, and I'm perfectly happy to wait however long it takes.
That was fast. I'll start breeding those for you today. Should have them by tomorrow (or Saturday at the latest). :)
So, I ended up getting the Garden Vivillons early, too :o

There's absolutely no rush on breeding, though. Take your time :)
I have your Pokemon ready to trade for the River pattern. I'll breed the Pokemon for the Garden pattern this weekend. I'll be available to trade all weekend.
Awesome. I'm still waiting to get the last River Vivillon from the trade that got interrupted, but should get it soon. I'll keep you updated.

This weekend works great for trading.
River set is complete :)

Weekend is still looking good for trading.
Finally have all 14 ready to trade! Let me know when you're ready to trade and I'll get online. We can start in gen 6 as usual.
Awesome! I can trade now-ish, if that works for you? I'll probably be hanging out on PSS for a while, so whenever is fine.
Yep, now is fine. Let me fire up my game and get online.
Just double checking. You did mean to trade me the shiny Lileep there on purpose, right?
Right! Several of the fossils really took a lot of time, so I was just happy the female HA hatched. Besides, my Shiny Pokedex collection is complete, so I don't need it.
Thanks, then! Feels like almost a shame to level up a shiny for breeding, but would feel like more of a shame to not breed a female SBHA fossil ;)
Thanks for the trade!
Thanks for the trades!
