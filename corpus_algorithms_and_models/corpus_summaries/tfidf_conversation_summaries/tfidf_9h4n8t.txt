Original Response:
Looking for help with my living dex.  I’ll accept any Sun exclusives, fully evolved pseudos, any legendaries, breedjects that I like, or anything that will evolve on trade.

If you can mass redeem then hit me up, especially if you have US

Older events/mythics/shinies just name a price.
Hi there, are you interested in breedables?
Very possible. What do you have?
Cool :) the following is a *very* unupdated list of on-hands so I apologize in advance if I no longer have something that you're interested in in stock bc I don't have time to breed, I also have literally 15+ boxes **full** of unhatched breedable eggs, some of which have active shiny hatchers on /r/SVExchange (if you haven't used SVExchange before I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about it)

I'll go double check I still have those in-stock, I'm mostly interested in K/G codes, are you interested in breedable eggs like I mentioned previously?
Yeah I’m down and also the treecko, and tepig
oh yes sorry! added those to the list :) also sorry I'm still lookin thru, how many codes can ya do for those 9?
6 for 11?
Whatever you want
I have all of the mons that you were interested in in stock, just the Mudkip is in a Dream ball instead of a Lure ball if that's ok?

sure so do you mean 6 codes for 11 breedables? I'd be happy to bring that up to 6 codes for 15+ breedables if you'd like :) I have Dream Tyrogue, Heavy (regular) Rockruff, Lure Poliwag, Heavy Beldum, Love Buneary, Heavy Delibrid, and Friend Pyukumuku ready to go
Sweet sounds good. Tyrogue, poliwag, beldum, and buneary sound good
cool! I'll be ready to trade in a few :)
added you and online now, I'll be in and out of the room for the next 5-10ish min so sorry if I miss your req or anythin
Ok it’ll take me a sec to pm the codes anyway
PM’d you and am on now
Codes received, thanks for the trade! :D
You’re awesome thank you

Summary:
I'll be ready to trade in a few :)
