Original Response:
Of course the fans want to see it. But just for the lols UFC should run like a Twitter poll or something, Nicco  vs Joanna, who do fans wanna see fight Valentina?
They'll just take it down and put it back up, but with UFC's choice of who won the poll. Think they did it with a Nate and conor where nate had more vores so they took it down and put it back up with conor winning
Are you suggesting the UFC's desire doesn't align with the fans' in this case? You think the fans would rather see Nicco v Valentina booked again over JJ v Valentina?
turns out the fans want to see joanna vs nicco
Even though it makes no sense, I would love to see Nicco get the Esparza treatment from Joanna
As a Joanna fan, I would enjoy the fight week leading up to this and prior to Nicco pulling out.
Nicco vs Cyborg.  At least Nicco should make weight for it right?  3 months later... *breaking news this just in Nicco is out of her featherweight fight due to what her team is calling another failed weight cut.  Strange twist she was seen being hospitalized with severe panic after seeing Cyborg hit pads at open workouts.*
BOOGEYWOMAN IS COOMIG, 4 REAL THIS TIME GUYS. IMMA BE IN THAT BITCH✍🏻👮
Can you imagine how bad JJ would fuck with Nicco? And she thought Valentina was a bully
DON'T BLINK TOMORROW 👀👀👀👀

Summary:
turns out the fans want to see joanna vs nicco.
