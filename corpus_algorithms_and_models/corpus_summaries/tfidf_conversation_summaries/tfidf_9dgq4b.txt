I can help you with Giratina and Kyurem. Can you trade?
Yeah what do you want
I'll do it for free.
Youâ€™re awesome. Gts?
No, friend me. You want to do this in Gen 6 (XYORAS)? I will trade the pokemon to you and then you trade it back.
Shoot how do you add someone on oras pss?
On your 3ds/2ds:  
  
* go to your home screen
* open the orange square smiley face at the top
* click "register friend" at the top
* enter my friend code: 4399-3550-3261  
* return to game
* click the blue wifi icon to go online
* I should be in your friend list
Ok got it
You don't need Kyurem?
