Original Response:
I'm out of the loop. What happened to prompt this?
Jalen Ramsey said give him 6 months and he'll be able to play NHL-level hockey.....
NFL player said if he had 6 months to train he'd make the NHL.

All the NHLers laughed in his face
Jalen Ramsey, NFL player for the Jacksonville Jaguars, said that he could make the NHL in six months of training despite not even knowing how to skate.
Ramsey said he could make the NHL with six months of practice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, somewhat related, the Titans (Nashville's NFL team) are rivals with the Jags and Jalen grew up in and played high school ball in Nashville. Still spends his offseasons there. So he is already very very well know in the area. I'm sure that could have helped prompt PK's tweet as well.
Except for kuzy he was very welcoming
I think Mackinnon said people needed to chill as well.
MacKinnon said he should do it, it would be hilarious.  I agree.
And some took it to ridiculous lengths in saying it disrespected the sport and was an insult. Hockey, serious business.
I mean, it is an insult tho...
He didn't mean it as in it's easy to play in the NHL though, he meant it as he's so ridiculously athletic he could make the switch to pro hockey. I didn't take it as him disrespecting hockey, just him talking himself up.
Where was this, is there video or something?
HES NO GOOD CANADIAN BOYILLTELLYA THAT THE WAY HES COMIN IN HERE AND TALKING ALL THAT SIX MONTH YA KNOW A GUY LIKE BORTAZZA FROM THUNDER BAY OR OR JOHN MASSEROLE WOULD NEVER RUN HIS MOUTH LIKE THIS JUST DISGRACEFUL
Don, turn off the caps lock. In real life too.

&gt; Current NHL free agent @jalenramsey is confident he can crack a lineup in six months.

I think the other way around is much more believable NHL -&gt; NFL. Skating is not something you're automatically good at because you are athletic.
If there's ever any doubt about whether or not a loud-mouth football player is being disrespectful, assume that they are.
Thats what Evander Kane said, said something like "I'd be 1000x better in his position in 6 months than he'd be in mine"
There are guys in the NFL that never even touched a football until highschool. It might literally be impossible to make the NHL if you started skating that late.
Pretty much every NHL level hockey player started playing before they turned 5, because you pretty much have to start that early to be able to skate that well. Football is a sport a lot of people don't pick up until high school.
Even if it was intended as an insult, it's so completely and obviously not true (that Ramsey could make the NHL), that getting offended by it is completely ridiculous. It's like if you're 6'5" and someone tries to insult you by calling you short. Like, no, you're not short, that's just dumb, so why would it even bother you?
I think it is theoretically possible to make the NHL if you started skating as an adult but I don't think anyone has the resources to make it happen. 

Essentially, if you paid a private skating coach to work with you (pretty much) every day, take 100 wrist/slap/snap/back-hand shots a day, spend an hour a day stick-handling, have a personal hockey coach work with you for an hour a day to work on you hockey knowledge, and had a personal trainer to work with you every day, in 7 or 8 years you could be an NHL player if you had the right body type and a lot of natural talent and started young enough.

To be clear I don't expect this to actually happen. I am just saying that \~8 hours/day of dedicated time spent mastering hockey would likely result in an adult getting to a highly competitive level in the sport, and some might be good enough to make the NHL.

I'm pretty sure TJ Oshie started playing hockey in high school, but to your point I bet he knew how to skate before then...Minnesotans are born on skates I think.

Ryan Johansen too
