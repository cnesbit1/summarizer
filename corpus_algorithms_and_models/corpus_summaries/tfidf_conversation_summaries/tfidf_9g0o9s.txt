Original Response:
With the NHL season still 18 days away, the KHL is already underway in its third week of play. Whether you’re looking for a quick fix until October 3rd, or you’ve always wanted a dog in the race in the KHL, here is an extensive guide to picking the right team for you.

**Route #1: Pretty Colors**

For those out there who don’t want to go through the hassle of changing their wardrobe, the simplest path in choosing a tea m is to go with your NHL team’s familial colors.

**Route #2: So Original**

If you long for the days of a league with only six teams and goalies masks amounted to the cartilage in your nose, then perhaps you want to take a look at some Soviet originals. The KHL as we know it has only been around since its 2008-2009 inaugural season. However, most of the clubs have existed in some form or another since before the KHL was founded.

SLOVAN BRATISLAVA – 1921

* Founded back when Czechoslovakia was one and the same, the club has been around for almost a century. It petitioned the league for entry in 2012, and has struggled in the tough Bobrov Division.

SKA ST. PETERSBURG – 1946  
CSKA MOSCOW – 1946

* “SKA” literally means Sports Club of the Army and were athletic clubs within the Ministry of Defense. Due to their history (including a 3-0 game comeback by SKA in 2015 Conference Finals) and current prominence in the league (both topping their respective divisions in 2017-2018), this is arguably the biggest rivalry in the KHL.

DYNAMO MOSCOW – 1946   
SPARTAK MOSCOW – 1946

* Both Moscow clubs are originals of the 1946 Soviet Championship League, where Dynamo beat Spartak in the first ever championship match.

Not So Original: For the expansion lovers out there – take a look at the league’s newest entrant – RED STAR KUNLUN.

DYNAMO RIGA (Latvia)  
DINAMO MINSK (Belarus)   
SLOVAN BRATISLAVA (Slovakia)  
BARYS ASTANA (Kazakhstan)

**Route #6: Other**

METALLURG MAGNITOGORSK

I mean, if you were ever into Pokémon at any point in your life, how could you not be into that name?

LOKOMOTIV YAROSLAVL

Lokomotiv is arguably the best-known team internationally for a unfortunate reason. On September 7th, 2011, nearly the entire team was killed in a plane crash during takeoff to a game in Minsk. The club canceled their 2011-2012 season, and the KHL does not play games on September 7th in order to mourn the tragedy.

TRAKTOR CHELYABINSK

If you come from a "lovable loser" type city in North America (not naming any names...), then you may have a kindred spirit with Chelyabinsk. The butt of infinite memes, as well as home to one of the most viral videos in history of a meteor striking the town in 2013, the hockey club has been a point of pride. Especially making the Gagarin Cup finals, but ultimately losing in the 2012-2013 season.

Hope you enjoyed the post! I would have liked to add more graphics and links, but if you are interested what the uniforms look like, or any of the prospects, I would recommend doing some further research.

Cheer for SKA because Putin’s rigged it for them to win /s
Yes but they still wins only 2 cups out of 10.
Hmm maybe they are like the KHL's version of the Rangers, afterall.
So I’m out of the loop, is the /s because he did (and you’re ironic about cheering for them) or because he didn’t?
Ouch.
The league isn’t rigged, but there’s no salary cap so the richest teams (like SKA) have the best chances of getting the best players and winning.
That was all bollocks. Last season I saw quite a few "journalists", led by Kalnins, claiming that KHL playoffs are rigged for SKA and if they lose, only CSKA would be allowed to beat them. SKA lost to CSKA in semi-final... and CSKA got demolished in the final.
Oh, well it’s not fair but nothing like I was imagining. Russian mob Bosses going around the locker rooms telling all other teams to lose, or something like that.
Okay, so it’s bullshit except for the salary cap. That seems pretty unfair.
Yeah, it’s similar to how football (soccer) works in Europe where you also have the richest teams getting the best players. Although I have heard something about the league considering a salary cap...
We kinda have a soft salary cap. Not providing parity, honestly. Though, SKA lost quite a few top players this off-season, so skill-wise it's sure closer at the top now.
Soft salary cap? What does that mean exactly? A handshake-deal between all teams saying they won’t go over a certain amount? And why did they lose a lot of players?
Soft cap means you get fined if you go over the cap.
Honestly half the reason I find most of the European football leagues so boring is because you know which teams are gonna win in most of them. The only things worth watching are Champions League and Premier League. 
A salary cap would go a long way to fix it but that’s not going to happen.
Cool, that’s pretty good though if the teams rich as fuck it probably won’t do much anyway.
And it really doesn't, SKA are so rich they just don't give a fuck lmao
It seems believable because it's nothing far fetched the way everything in Russia with money is so tainted and how they systematically dope athletes at the Olympics.
Fine is 20% (850M rub cap). Next year it's 30% (800M rub cap) and in 2020/21 hard cap of 900M rub ($13.2M) is introduced.
Players left for NHL, as well as other KHL clubs. Starting goalie Koskinen went to the Oilers, Kovy went to LA, Shipachev was let go at the end of the season. We got quite a few of young prospects in the team, plus Datsyuk is still doing his magic at the age of 40.
So there's a confirmed year for the hard cap being introduced? oh shit that's awesome!
(but it's not true)
Yup, they introduced a 5 year plan last fall, 2021/22 will have the same cap as 2020/21, so teams know in advance how to build their teams in transition from soft to hard cap.
THe league is absolutely handicapped in SKA's favor. That doesn't make it the WWF, with scripted results.
...so you're telling me there's a chance dinamo might eventually win something for once?
As long as they find someone capable of playing hockey, cause I'm pretty sure SKA is under the cap this year :P
i mean, we're looking not too awful this year, our new additions have been pretty good. also, where can you even find khl contract info?
I don't think they made it public, but they usually announce when clubs go over in general. No reports just yet.
Agreed. I only watch pl and cl and the occasional el clasico. No point in watching real madrid destroy some local village team.
I mean, sure WWF is scripted/choreographed, but the effort and pain are real.
Yeah, still gotta chuck that 240 lb dude across the ring.. Pretty gnarly haha
Here's a cbc podcast about KHL rigging. I don't think there's any 100% definitive proof but it is certainly fishy https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-march-12-2018-1.4571846/russia-s-corrupt-hockey-playoffs-mirror-putin-s-ideology-says-sports-writer-1.4572275
Hell, WWF hasn't been WWF for 16 years.
It'll always be WWF for me.
IT'S STILL REAL TO ME DAMNIT!!
I think your definitely overrating the competitiveness at the top of the PL, in the last twenty years only 5 different teams have won it. However there's definitely alot of quality throughout the league, so upsets are more likely.

Source : Am an arsenal fan
You guys always have to have those 5 year plans, huh?
Hey, better than guessing how fucked you're gonna be in two months :)
&gt; SKA lost quite a few top players this off-season

Man, I hope Kovy does well with us.
The referees can call penalties for their favored team but they can't score goals. Guy scores from a slapshot 10 metres away, the ref can't deny the goal due to goalie interference or say that the puck didn't cross the goal line when it's in the back of the net. I'm not saying the leagues is rigged, I'm saying that just because a certain team didn't win doesn't mean that the odds weren't stacked in their favor.
Iirc they released a league plan to increase parity which include thugs such  as cutting teams (kind of allows the shared tv revenue to increase with less teams sharing), hard cap, along with other things by a certain date. Someone else mentioned 2022 which I think was the date they said they would do a hard cap rather than the current soft one.

Summary:
So there's a confirmed year for the hard cap being introduced?
Players left for NHL, as well as other KHL clubs.
THe league is absolutely handicapped in SKA's favor.
Soft cap means you get fined if you go over the cap.
Cheer for SKA because Putin’s rigged it for them to win /s.
We kinda have a soft salary cap.
Although I have heard something about the league considering a salary cap...
i mean, we're looking not too awful this year, our new additions have been pretty good.
The KHL as we know it has only been around since its 2008-2009 inaugural season.
