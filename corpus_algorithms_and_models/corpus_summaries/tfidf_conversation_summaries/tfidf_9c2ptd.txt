Original Response:
There is a disturbingly high number of Christians here who defends this terrible practice simply because it's in the Bible, and your God is okay with slavery. I feel like debating the subject is disingenuous because if it appears your God had any knowledge of today's or some future standards to understand slavery would have become morally discouraged or abandoned. Then if God of Christians denounced slavery then surely the Christians here would denounce it too. This is an issue I have with their Bible makes Christians have an unstable foundation for basing your morals on a barbaric book that supposedly never changes, but clearly does change. 

With the disapproval of slavery in modern times does it mean it was wrong for your God to be okay with it? Assuming your God is just above us or timeless then surely it could come to the conclusion owning another human is a deplorable practice or will be considered deplorable. Was your God wrong to allow the status quo, and why can atheists or those do don't subscribe to your God have higher standards of morality or at least condemn the practice of all slavery?
