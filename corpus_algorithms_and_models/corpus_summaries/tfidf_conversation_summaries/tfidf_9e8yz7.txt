Original Response:
First of all, Evolution is fact. The only ones that deny that do so because of their religious beliefs, and since evolution is true the origin story presented in bible is not. But what is really troubling for the idea that a loving God exists is the sheer amount of suffering in our planet. Millions of years of all kinds of life forms having to fight for food, fight for territory, fight for mates etc. Not to mention diseases, geological disasters and mass extinction events such as the one who wiped out the dinossaurs. The life forms who fail to survive and reproduce are removed from the genetic pool without mercy. Why a loving God would design something so horrible? I know that I can't prove that God doesn't exist but looking at the universe at are the odds? Now, I know that you will use the "fall of men" excuse but the problem with that is that adam and eve never existed. We know this because of the amazing amount of evidence we have that humans evolved from primates. Without adam and eve the "original sin" excuse becomes meaningless. So how do you explain a loving God creating something so injust as Natural Selection?

Summary:
Without adam and eve the "original sin" excuse becomes meaningless.
