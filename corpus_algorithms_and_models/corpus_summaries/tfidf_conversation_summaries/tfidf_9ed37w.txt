Original Response:
If God was to judge us down purely to the standard of whether we believed that jesus died for our sin, I can confinidently say he is in fact a moral monster. 

Simply put, you would have people that would believe purely out of fear of punishment. They could still do good things and be a genuine good person but be absolutely terrified of where God would send them after death. Which is potentially causing someone to believe purely under duress and leads to another problem of just saying you believe vs actually believing. 

Someone could say they believe in jesus but be so conflicted internally that they would actually be just a "through the motion Christian" they go to church, sing songs, give praise hopeing that one day they will actually believe but if they didn't truly believe then by Christian's standards they are doomed to hell. 

Now a person could actually believe that God is real, that jesus died for theirs sins and the could be a completely evil person,  but as long as they get washed every day in the blood of christ they would go to heaven correct? 

How is that a good system to judge any creature by? Man or other wise. Would merits not make for sure a better system. You treated your fellow man and my creation of the universe with love whether you believed or not, please enjoy paradise and all it has to offer seems like and actual all loving, pure justice God. Not the God of the bible

Summary:
Not the God of the bible.
