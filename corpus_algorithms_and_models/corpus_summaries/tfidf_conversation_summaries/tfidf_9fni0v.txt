Original Response:
Was he abused (or perhaps heavily drunk) before being pushed in? This isn't mentioned in the CNA story.

If he was a fit 22-year-old NSF who knew how to swim and wasn't abused beforehand, wouldn't we normally expect him to be able to survive, especially if someone jumped in to rescue him **8 seconds** after he was pushed in?

---

For those who have misconstrued this comment of mine as placing the blame on the victim for being "not fit enough" or "drunk", please read my below comment. My point is about all the unanswered questions.
Yeah it's entirely his own fault that he died in a well of deepwater on the last day of his enlistment..... /s
At no point did my comment above ascribe any blame to him.

I was trying to better understand the surrounding circumstances, including the possibility of his being otherwise "ragged" (beaten up or made to drink heavily) beforehand.

There is even the possibility that his "buddies" made it more "challenging" (as they do in such silly orientation/ragging/ORD ceremonies) by doing things like blindfolding him or tying his hands/legs up before throwing him into the well. These are items that they could have removed and swore to stay quiet about after they retrieved his body but before the proper investigative authorities arrived.

There is also the question of with what severe force and how awkwardly they threw him into the well.

--- 

I have now just read the very brief Press Release/PDF and the above are all questions that were not addressed. 

Instead, all we have are amazingly precise timings of when he was pushed in (9:07pm), when someone first jumped in to rescue him (8 seconds after), and when his body was extracted (9:43pm).

Yet not a word about what exactly they were doing **before** he was pushed in (other than that they presented him with a plaque and had some cake) or the severity of the force with which he was thrown in.

---

I have now read on the [TNP](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/scdf-nsf-who-died-pump-well-could-not-swim) that:

&gt; Mr Kok [the father] revealed that he had found wounds on his son's forehead and cheek.

&gt; Two of his teeth had also fallen off.

These seem like pretty important details. So either (a) the father was lying; (b) the father was mistaken; or most likely of all (c) these are important details that have somehow been glossed over and left unmentioned in all the official press releases.
I believe multiple (previous) news sources have said that he couldnt swim. He even said he was afraid to come back because he knew he was going to get tossed in. But he still went ahead anyway because he bought snacks for everyone on his last day.
He was fit, but doesn't know how to swim
Fuck outta here, this isnt the straits times comment section
Damn. I can’t even begin to imagine the horror he felt when he realized his life was ending because he decided to have faith in the people he used to call his comrades and wanted to give them snacks as a final gesture..and then they betrayed that good faith...

I never liked those pranks that involved pushing your friend down, or pushing them off something, it just never seemed funny to me.

All it takes is for one minor factor going wrong and you might’ve just killed your friend.
He simply did not know how to swim. And was thrown into the well in a state of panic.
Even a fit, 22-year old NSF who knew how to swim may not have survived.

Knowing how to swim doesn’t save you from a 12m well, nor does it naturally help you to resurface quickly from depth.
The wounds and the missing teeth, all these evidence and you can still feel that something is still not quite right? It's pure bullying gone over the top.
Please help me understand. If someone who can't swim is pushed into that well or any other body of water, wouldn't that person be struggling at the surface before sinking?
Breathing technique. I think He didn’t take a deep breathe before being pushed down.
Ahh okay thank you!
Hais. He must be having a very hard time once he pushed in. 

1. Pushed into the water. (Breathe out)
2.  Dropped inside submerged. (Breathe in)
3. Water go into lungs
4. Don’t know how to tread water to stay afloat. 
5. Out of air, try to push out water from lungs. 
6. Water in lungs, no oxygen, black out. 
7.  Water in lungs, heavy, sinked. 

Edit: THREAD WATER!!!!!
Edit: tread !!
If he couldn't swim and panicked he would easily go under and drown. When people panic in the water they kick frantically this creates a lot of air bubbles directly under them that causes them to sink more and their head to go under. This is also another reason why life guards can drown even if they are a strong swimmer if the person is kicking and panicked.  
   
Also if the SG uniform is anything like the US uniform it feels like it clings to your skin when soaked and that could also make you panic more because it feels like your chest is being compressed and it adds a lot of weight that you have to keep above the water.  
    
In the US my unit did yearly 'drown proofing' where you learned to stay calm when you fell in deep water with a uniform and rifle, but even if you are properly trained it can be hard to keep calm and do what you are trained to do.
Omg thank you for the explanation!
Saw lifeguard training videos on YouTube. Apparently not everyone makes loads of sound when they drown. And some people sink naturally (heavy bones etc). Obviously I don't know how it went for this poor guy.
maybe he got knocked out cold or something.. its very tragic.
Yeah, iirc i heard his face hit the sides after being pushed in, was missing a tooth when he was fished out.
The human body is not naturally buoyant and is in fact less buoyant in non-salt water. There are easy ways to keep afloat but those behaviours need to be trained; its equally as easy to sink and stay there.
This was SCDF though, not SAF. I'm not sure what firefighters would be wearing.
Depends on how fat they are. Fat is less buoyant than water so it helps you to float. Doesn't mean a fat person can survive in the sea, the waves are rough.
L O L TRAP WATER????????? I believe it’s called “tread water”. RIP ENGLISH.
yes. papa nazi, very helpful comment
&gt;Edit: THREAD WATER!!!!!

Hate to be pedantic here, but it's "tread". No 'h'.

**Cold shock response**

Cold shock response is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water.

In humans, cold shock response is perhaps the most common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has to work harder to pump the same volume of blood throughout the body.

Aint no nazi if it aint grammar.
I saw some videos of people drowning. The whole thing lasted for less than a minute. Water was still after like nothing happened.
From what I'm told, "fat floats" is negligible even for the obese; its a popular misconception thanks to an old Garfield comic (FYI: Lying on one's back works only in calm water).
Nah, unless the tank is chilled or something Singapore is nowhere near cold enough for this.
Yeah I think it’s a movie thing that shows people struggling and splashing a lot while drowning. People who can’t swim can’t tread water and go under quickly without making much noise or splashes
damn! that was one hard push!
Do the people responsible get charged?

They knew he can't swim but they still pushed him, what the fuck
Remember during the investigation say 5 including regular and nsf will get charged by spf.
They did get charged
I see, good, they totally deserved it. no brain sia.
Tbh, the charge probably won't do enough justice for the victim. Not that I'm saying they deserve death or something, but the regular gonna get henta kaki-ed their promotions and NSF gets DB for a few months, nothing more than a short inconvenience compared to what the victim went through unwillingly.
&gt; Not that I'm saying they deserve death or something

But why? Regular or nsf, How is this not at least involuntary manslaughter? Even if is life imprisonment for them if guilty, I'd say our country's High Court has gone lenient on them; anything less just means this country respect no laws &amp; Shanmugam/minlaw are getting salary to eat liao bee.
It isn't involuntary manslaughter because they are currently serving their NS and in a way under military law rather than civilian law where they will be dealt with by the military police and not our courts. 

AFAIK, I don't think there is a very harsh punishment like life sentence or death when it comes to military law unless you really really big time fuck up like crimes against the state itself or something of equal magnitude.

It's a very complicated matter. Years and years of vicious cycle where hazing is basically tradition and peer pressure, guys being stupid and upbringing where guys are supposed to be tougher than they look and they forget that there are guys who are actually quite brittle. Just a series of unfortunate events leading up to this incident, you can't just undo what has been done for years overnight. If you charge every single person who has been involved, I'm sure at least a quarter of our defence force would be in DB. To them, it's just their luck they have a "weaker" (lack of a better word) victim to haze where any other person would have survived the ordeal just fine.

I'm sure there were hazings far worse than this in the past and nobody died then, and the older generation definitely have the "back in my day people ate literal shit and didn't die from diseases " speech with their own millennials children (us) and this definitely contributed to the kind of mentality where people expect us not to die from this level of hazing just because your dad had been through worse. It just takes one incident like this to let the hazing get banned for a bit but inevitably they all move on and forget and we get another case like this 2-3 years down the road.

I just hope my fellow generation who are regulars in the army can grow the fuck up and wipe away this stupid ass tradition that literally serves no purposes other than getting high from power and bullying others for their own entertainment
They are civil defence members. Not under military law and military police.
[deleted]
There's the civil defence act which they're subject to. SCDF has their own military police equivalent and have their own DB too. I guess most people don't know about them since most men aren't drafted to SCDF.
They’ve been charged, it was all over the news?
[deleted]
Regulars fall under PSC disciplinary framework. NSmen and NSF fall under CDact. Likewise SCDF PU mainly handles mainly NSF and NSmen cases.
If a quarter of the defence force need to go to DB, it shows how fucked up national service is and how such a huge clean up is needed, or we should just abolish NS.
&gt;Just abolish NS.

No.
I believe if the crime is serious enough, you will be "discharged" from the military and charged in court.
&gt;should just abolish NS

Oh boy, you just opened a can of worms on yourself, prepare for the downvotes (I'm not gonna downvote you). How successful Singapore is today can partly be credited to NS imho. The hazing tradition is bad, but let's not discredit the many, many benefits NS has brought for us and the state. 

Just to name a few:

- The camaraderie literally every guy who went through NS in Singapore share. From 50 years ago where the first conscription started, till today, we all met the same kind of people and been through the same kind of shit. You can go up to an uncle on the street and talk about NS, and have a decent amount of conversation, despite being complete strangers.

- Some level of patriotism was inculcated during NS and definitely make me wanna strive for Singapore and not any other country, for me at least.

- Singapore's only natural resource is our people, we don't have natural mountains to dig, land to build tons of reservoirs for water etc. People are literally our only strong point, and NS brings guys of every race/religion, shape or size together and bond for 2 years. You don't see racial/religion intolerance in Singapore for a reason, and NS contributes some parts of that.

- personal health benefits, I'm sure Singapore young male adults are of the healthier ones among the young male adults of the world because of NS. I'm sure even our slightly weaker PES brothers can kick the asses of the others any time of the day.

I could go on and on about why we need NS. As a recently ORD-ed NSMen, yeah conscription sucks major dick and it sucks having to be the one to go through NS, but it sure is necessary af for both ourselves and the nation. To quote some patriotic shit: "we go through shit so that our loved ones will never have to."
[removed]
Woah woah woah where did all that come from? Just to clarify, I'm not a regular nor I want to become one. I'm just a regular citizen who still thinks NS is necessary. It's really not the system that makes it unsafe, it's the handful of people. Don't hate the game, hate the players.

You sound like a real intelligent person, if you proposed to abolish NS, then what do you propose to counter the incoming lack of national defence?
[removed]
Bro are you okay? Do you need some professional help? If you need to find someone to rant and complain, I'm all for it. Why so much angst towards a stranger? Unless I'm unbeknownst to myself the minister of defense, such comments are rude and uncalled for. I'm not a regular but at least have some basic respect towards others.

Why would I even lie about being a regular or not? What sort of benefits do I even get putting such a comment on the internet? 

Are you recently conscripted to NS so you harbor such hatred towards NS? You have a lot going on that I have no idea and want nothing to do with tbh.
It's murder then.
Hilarious insane you are
Dont bother arguing, look at his post history, its full of negativity. I did my best to look for any encouraging or positive post but from the looks at it, he knows everything and you are just wrong if you dont agree. No grey areas.
[removed]
The fuck are you talking about? You're the insane one lol. It's not like the government imprisons you in camp. Did someone touch you the wrong way when you were younger to make you become like this? Judging from your post history, you seem really, really against literal foundations of society. It's just amazing how are you still alive and around in the day and age with that sort of mentality.

Define hour slavery? Like literally working? In that sense, even your idol Mark Zuckerberg is an hour slave since he earns money by the hour if you want to calculate it like that. God your warped mind is something to be amazed at.
So 1 NSF life is worth less than 1 civilian life. Fuck military law. Are we not civilians in our own country just because we are forced to serve?
[removed]
Where is their db?
1. there's no manslaughter in Singapore, but there are causing death by a rash/negligent act and culpable homicide not amounting to murder

2. it's not the courts which choose the charge, but the prosecution
Somewhere in Choa Chu Kang, IIRC.
I see, thanks!
No matter what is done to them, it will never compare to the pain of losing a child...
[deleted]
In case it isn’t obvious to you, this isn’t about the ability to swim. He was thrown into a well that was 12m deep. Having the ability to swim won’t save you from drowning if you’re not able to trap water and resurface from depth.

Why are you blaming the victim, who god rest his soul, has already paid the highest price? What more should he have had to do? He’s a firefighter for god’s sake. No vocation in the SAF/SCDF/SPF requires you to be able to survive being thrown into a well.

This was NOT his fault. Please do not tarnish his memory. 

No one is required in NS to be “able to swim”. Not even Naval Divers. It’s good if you can swim, but if not they can be taught. And divers have rebreathers while diving, which is a totally different scenario. And how is being a Corporal any different? Must you be able to swim proficiently to be a Corporal?
I don’t know where you got this info from bro. So if I don’t know how to swim, I CANNOT enlist until I learn how to swim? And btw NSMen is ORD-ed Personel, NSF is when we serve the 2 years.
By right yes, by left no. The swimming requirement was no longer adhered to about 2 or 3 years ago. Even when I was doing my training, those who consistently struggled with swimming week after week were still allowed to pass out. It's like a, "We tried our best but this guy can't swim," kind of thing.
[deleted]
Or so they say lah 

If you cnt swim you get 1-2 lessons in bmt. Cant figure out by then too bad. Besides, oso not navy, most vocations will never put you near a water body larger you MUST swim

 For me i had an open wound in bmt. So i cant enter the pool. I never entered a pool in ns since.

So it is entirely possible to ORD w/o knowing how to swim.

[removed]
eh, not even naval divers meh... pretty sure they have ridiculous swimming tests, IIRC they have to swim the entire length of an olympic sized pool in one breath

agree with the rest though
Apologies, should have been more clear, what I meant is, there is no requirement to swim when they are enlisted, much less an SCDF firefighter. 

If you can swim, it’s advantageous. They become proficient after training but combat diving really isn’t much about Swimming. They do however become proficient in extricating themselves from depth/trapping water. (My close friends are combat divers, they aren’t good swimmers to any extent)
i was thinking about NDU, not sure if its totally synonymous with combat divers in general

but yeah at the time of enlistment there is no specific requirement
Yeah, NDU is the only combat diving unit in RSN. That’s all I meant, that there’s no requirement because the original commenter was asking, why is the victim, a Corporal, not able to swim.
Is it even possible to swim 50m in one breath?
the world record is 200m... 50m is practically nothing to trained professionals
That's really amazing. One breath?? Wow I need to see it with my own eyes to really believe.
Check out freediving. Be prepared to catch your jaw when it drops after seeing the absurd physical limits these men and women push themselves to.

Summary:
I could go on and on about why we need NS.
that was one hard push!
They knew he can't swim but they still pushed him, what the fuck.
Why would I even lie about being a regular or not?
He was fit, but doesn't know how to swim.
Woah woah woah where did all that come from?
I saw some videos of people drowning.
If someone who can't swim is pushed into that well or any other body of water, wouldn't that person be struggling at the surface before sinking?
Just to clarify, I'm not a regular nor I want to become one.
Is it even possible to swim 50m in one breath?

He simply did not know how to swim.
