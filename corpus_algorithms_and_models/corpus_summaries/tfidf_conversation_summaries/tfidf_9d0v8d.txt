I don't blame Anet for the app related issues, I think that's on Kung Fu Tea for not sorting their shit out.

What I do think they fucked up on is this thing altogether really. Not anticipating and being ready for malicious users is one, but the very idea of being an internationally played game and having a promotion that many of their players can't really access is a bit stupid.
I hate to say this, but foresight has never been Anet's forte. They do well for the most part, but when they screw up they *really* screw up. I think they get so excited about their own activity and hopes about the community's reaction that they don't stop and ask themselves "how can this be exploited."
&gt;but the very idea of being an internationally played game and having a promotion that many of their players can't really access is a bit stupid.

On that note - they've now limited this _entire_ thing to US only players (website was updated to reflect that). The FB rep is trying to make out that they "forgot" to mention that (took 5 days?) which is only fanning the flames. Let's not forget - this was advertised in all regions (apart from China) in the damn launcher, and now Kung Fu has limited it to the US? 

I went as far as to make a US Fakebook account (location to Miami which is pretty much all you can do in terms of location), used a US VPN and even set my phone's GPS to the US (from the UK) and that outfit reward is still missing from the list so they've broken that as well. 

This is an ***utter*** shambles.
I think it might be a good thing they've removed the outfit. Tying an exclusive in game reward to something only US people can get is a horrible idea. 

Now they are actually requiring that you have a photo of your tea for them before winning anything. That's probably how they should have done it from the beginning? This is a whole damn mess. . .
To be honest, removing it just made it *worse* especially knowing there's scalpers *selling near hundreds of codes* on eBay and G2A.

They should just mail it in-game to everyone, and only have this "promo" for the Heroic edition at most.
To be fair, I still think that goes back to Kung Fu Tea on this. We don't know the behind the scenes stuff. ANet could have anticipated all this and explained out these potential issues to the Kung Fu Tea people and just been told that "we got this, it's all good" or something along those lines. The blame still falls on ANet for trusting them in the first place, but when it comes to Kung Fu Tea's handling of the situation and preparedness with their app, to me that might fall more on KFT.
"Happy (whatever number)^th GW2 anniversary! To celebrate this momentous occassion, we're sending *everyone* a Dragon Tee!" Done. Fixed with very little effort. Kind of like how they sent out those Royal Guard Outfits^1

^1      "The Royal Guard Outfit was gifted to accounts which were created prior to August 29, 2015 as part of the third anniversary of Guild Wars 2."
Yeah sadly gotta anticipate malicious idiots which is a shame.

Although not trying to slight Kung Fu Tea in any way here but I don't think they were exactly a good place for a promo like that anyway. I hadn't even HEARD of that company until this promotion and looking at their location map I'm going to say they aren't covering areas where most of the player base would be anywhere near anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a moderately reasonably sized city and there's only two in the whole state, both over 2 hours away that's just silly and most of their map appears to not even cover the vast majority of the US as it were
I agree but even then it's a ridiculous promo that company seems relatively small in the grand scheme of things their location map doesn't even seem to cover like half the continental US. Honestly I'm repeating myself in another comment a tad here but I hadn't even heard of them till this promo because there's only two in this state and they're both over 2 hours away that's not even remotely worth the drive. Nothing against Kungfu Tea but they weren't a good choice for what should have been, a wide spread promotion
They gave the name to the promotion and should own responsibility for that reason. 

The wont be able to do anything about the info but they could give the free shirt on the store. At least it would be a gesture towards the community. However it usually is hard for big companies to own their mistakes, so I wouldnâ€™t be incredibly surprised of they decided to act as if nothing really happened.
Personally, I don't blame ANet for all the issues, but it does look pretty bad on their part that they agreed to this marketing campaign and let an unproven company handle (poorly) this PR. 

I work in marketing and in my experience companies should be very controlling of their IP and how it's conveyed to the public. This seems to be a poorly thought out campaign.
Well, I can see how it would be hard for Anet to partner up with a much bigger brand name with tons of presence, since what benefit would a big brand have of doing so? That's not to say that Anet is a tiny indie company by any means, but being reasonably well known as a gaming company is nothing like being well known in the restaurant and cafe biz. 

If anything I was surprised to see that the company was larger than I had expected, with (a few) locations outside of the U.S.A. 
I just don't think a cafe or restaurant partner is the way to go. It might be easy to get a GW2 player to go try out a tea, but to get a tea buyer to try GW2 is quite difficult, since GW2 is a much more complex thing.
Also, of course the "wtf is Kung Fu Tea"-issue. If you want to advertise, you generally put your name on something **known**.

Not on something even more obscure than what you're trying to advertise.
I agree, this is all on KFT. All ArenaNet did besides put the promo on the launcher would have been to supply KFT with codes to give away.
I said this in another comment, but it's not KFT's app. It's a promotional app by LevelUp Consulting:

&gt;Well, it's not their app. It's just their promo crap running on an app by LevelUp Consulting. This kind of stuff is their [*jam*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/cluster?clp=igM4ChkKEzU1OTk3ODYyNDM3NDMwNzkzOTYQCBgDEhkKEzU1OTk3ODYyNDM3NDMwNzkzOTYQCBgDGAA%3D:S:ANO1ljIANd0) ... customer metrics programs.

&gt;They've also ["joined" grubhub](https://www.thelevelup.com/) for additional corporate power.

It sounds like they *are* a smaller company completely out of their pay grade for coverage on this kind of thing, but LevelUp appears to have a good bit of experience making these things and have partnered with grubhub, so it's not like *they're* some smaller company with no experience with this stuff. 

I don't know... It seems like a shitshow all around and like you said, someone ...*bigger* should've been the company to take the brunt of this kind of thing. Or at least someone who's able to handle something like this would've been a better choice than a low-coverage drink shop.
This should have more upvotes.

It's a really simple solution to this whole debacle. 

All Anet needs to do is pick an arbitrary date (all accounts created prior to the end of 2013, maybe? Or prior to f2p launch or just give it to everyone who has a full account at this point..) and then give it away the same way as the Royal Guard Outfit.
How could they not given one of the most scarce resources for end-game gear progression is only generated by logging in? (apart from the occasional daily mystic forger).  If I had the opportunity to have 10 or even more free accounts, I'd jump at the chance.

Not to mention the in-game revenue these accounts would give to gold sellers. 

The idea of giving full, unrestricted GW2 accounts for nothing more than a fake twitter accout was completely misguided.  The people who came up with this stunt clearly have no idea how GW2 works.

Summary:
I agree, this is all on KFT.
I think it might be a good thing they've removed the outfit.
I just don't think a cafe or restaurant partner is the way to go.
Although not trying to slight Kung Fu Tea in any way here but I don't think they were exactly a good place for a promo like that anyway.
I said this in another comment, but it's not KFT's app.
To be fair, I still think that goes back to Kung Fu Tea on this.
What I do think they fucked up on is this thing altogether really.
