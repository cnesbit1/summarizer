####Looking for:
* Codes
* WCSK Metagross
* Steven's Beldum
* XY&amp;Z / Kimia's Gardevoir
* Offers

####TSV Egg for codes with the following rate:

5 IV | 6IV/HP | 1:7 Gender | Incenses | 
---|---|----|----|
2 Codes | +1 Code | +1 Code | +1 Code |

&amp;nbsp;
##### UBs I can go up to 5 IVs. 
* Shiny + Nature = 7 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 4IV = 9 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 5IV = 12 codes
* Legendaries + 3 Codes


### &amp;nbsp;
* Vivilon patterns available: **Sun, Savannah, Marine &amp; Polar**
* Custom shinies/UBs will be RNG'd on a console with pCalc &amp; CFW.
* I can also offer RNG in **Retail HeartGold**, but the only (good and shiny) things I have left are:

* Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Entei
* ~~Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Kyogre~~
* Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31- Ho-Oh. 
* Sucker Punch Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31
Golem
* Sucker Punch Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31 Shiftry
* Sucker Punch Adamant -31/31/31/17/31/31 Slaking*
* Dittos (non shiny here)


**Have to check this.*

We should discuss the rates here, but I'm not looking for anything crazy for those because I want to reset the savefile anyways.

Finally, make offers if you want something here. I might be interested even if I didn't list it here.

I have T/T KG and LL Codes!
Hi, and what are you looking for? :) Not looking for more TT codes for now BTW
No worries! How much would a timid Blacephalon be?
* Shiny + Nature = 7 codes
* Shiny + Nature = 9 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 5IV = 12 codes
So a shiny timid would be 7?
Yep
So sorry but I have to sleep now, I will reply to you tomorrow morning!
Actually, I realized it might be easier if we discussed now so you could get whatever you need. How much would the gen 4 shiny kyogre be?
Sorry, I actually went to sleep after seeing your comment :P I think 6 codes is fair for the Kyogre.
Don’t worry, I slept after sending it xD. And 6 Codes is fine, I can do 3 KG and 3 LL. I won’t be able to trade until much later in the day unfortunately
No worries, I'm on the same boat here.
Hey, forgot to ask but what ball do you want the Kyogre to be in?
Is it shiny or regular?
Shiny with the mentioned spread
Love ball in that case
Perfect! Will let you know when I catch it
Alright!
Hey, sorry for the delay. I don't usually take this long for Gen 4 RNGs but today I was busy for 14 hours and the only hour I had time to RNG Kyogre killed itself after running out of PP xD


Tomorrow I will try again.
No worries! Rng can be annoying sometimes I understand.
Hi, I already catched Kyogre. I should be able to trade in 3 hours!
Sure thing!
Hi, I'm already available!
I'm getting on now!
I'm already in Plaza!
Okay perfect. I have the codes ready for ya! Any chance you have a screenshot of the frames you were rng'ing for? If not, that's not an issue
I can't show the frame directly. I took some screenshots of the encounter and capture tho. Also, the frame is always the same for a given PID. I can still give you pics of the frame in RNGReporter but it's generic, not exclusive to a seed like in Gen 7
I would love screenshots for the encounter and capture, and yeah I know it'll be generic but would you mind giving me that as well? Sorry if I'm being a little nagging, I just wanna gather as much as RNG proof!
Also I have sent the codes!
Codes received, I will send everything (frame + pics/video of the encounter) in 30 mins. I want to eat first :D
That sounds great, thanks!

Summary:
Hi, I already catched Kyogre.
* Shiny + Nature = 7 codes
* Shiny + Nature = 9 codes
* Shiny + Nature + 5IV = 12 codes.
Also I have sent the codes!
I have T/T KG and LL Codes!
How much would the gen 4 shiny kyogre be?
