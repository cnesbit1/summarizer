Original Response:
I support the repeal of 377a. But i think I understand their misconception

1. Sex is between a man and a woman

2. Gay sex is slightly deviant

3. Bestiality is very deviant

4. If we allow slightly deviant, we will eventually allow very deviant, because when slightly deviant is considered okay, very deviant will then  e considered slightly deviant, and when history repeats itself, slightly deviant bestiality will be considered normal

But the reality is that the repeal of 377a is based on consent. That's the qualitative difference, and therefore won't lead to a slippery slope. Slippery slope is only valid when one thing is a more severe version of another thing, when there is a quantitative difference but not qualitative. Regardless of how deviant or not you think gay sex is, that's not the point. The point is that all consensual sex should be allowed. If we remember that children and animals cannot give consent, then 377a has  no implications on either of those things
I agree. And the more we normalize healthy gay relationships the less deviant it is culturally and the less the slippery slope will be a concern. I dream of a day where gay teens stop committing suicide and are free to pursue first crushes and learn healthy relationship boundaries the way straight kids are idolized for  üôèüôèüôè

like my and their underage marriages
Slippery slope is one of my most hated logical fallacies next to the strawman. 

You literally just divert the issue to another unrelated topic and call it an "argument" which I learnt in Secondary School Humanities doesn't help your case.
It is important to note though that slippery slopes are a thing. It's a fallacy because it's not always backed up. You can't just anyhow say one thing leads to another, but it does happen when the only difference between the supposed cause and effect is magnitude or severity
Just to play devil's advocate, what about, say, consensual incest?
My personal opinion is that as long as it's not reproductive and truly consensual (no grooming), then go ahead
Women used to be deemed unable to consent.

And if you don't need animals' consent to kill them to eat, why do you need their consent to fuck them?

Also virtually everyone who claims that all consensual sex should be allowed is against incest.
Have you seen gay pride parades in the US? Despite normalizing healthy gay relationships they are still deliberately culturally deviant
The slippery slope is well documented for gay marriage

"consider:

1. Editorial, A Vote Against Hate, Louisville Courier-J., Feb. 3, 1994, at 6A, arguing that the claim that a hate crime law "would lead to acceptance of gay marriages" was "arrant nonsense."

2. Editorial, A Gay-Protection Forum, Boston Globe, Oct. 15, 1989, at A30: "Nor does passage of the bill [that bans sexual orientation discrimination in various commercial transactions] put Massachusetts on a 'slippery slope' toward [same-sex marriage or domestic benefit] rights."

3. Phil Pitchford, Council Members Wary of Partner Registry, Riverside Press-Enterprise (quoting Riverside Human Relations Commission member Kay Smith): "Those that truly have a problem with homosexuality will see [a domestic partnership proposal] as part of the 'slippery slope' [toward same-sex marriages] .... But, this legislation needs to be looked at on the face value of what it is, and it really does very little."

Yet consider how the California Supreme Court used the legislative enactment of these sorts of laws as part of its basis for deciding that the right to marry should be seen as encompassing same-sex marriage"
Why not reproductive?

If birth defects concern you, then would you force a couple who has had a kid with Down's Syndrome to divorce and ban them from having sex? After all, they have a proven risk of having kids with birth defects
Because of birth defects *on a national scale*. We're talking about millions of people with siblings. In order to govern and legislate a population, we need to look at large numbers of people as a statistic rather than a collection of individuals. The human brain simply cannot handle 4 million individual cases. Maybe one day we'll be ruled by computers and they'll be able to treat us as individuals, but an organic brain cannot.

So, I'll by default ban siblings from reproducing, and if they're so confident they have perfect genetics, they can pay for a test for exemption.

I cannot ban a couple from trying again and again to have a fully functioning child, but that's because of public morals, not individual logic. My objective isn't to help humans evolve through eugenics. It's to eliminate as many burdens on society as **reasonably** possible. Logic would dictate that we engage in eugenics. But we as a society are more than logic. Logic would also dictate that we eliminate the arts and focus only on STEM. But we have emotions. Making people happy is an equally noble cause as making people healthy or comfortable.

Eugenics is horrible because people are imperfect. Communism fails because people are imperfect. Does capitalism really really work with all the inequality it creates? The faults are because people are imperfect. It's foolish to strive for a perfect system of government when it's just going to be run by imperfect humans, on imperfect humans. We can only make do with the best we have. Which means capitalism, personal freedom despite poor quality genes, etc etc. If we really wanted a perfect system, we'd lose our humanity in the process of achieving it.

I'm going to stop typing now because I've gone off topic. But if you're interested in what I said you can ask
We've now recognised that women are psychologically equal to men. One day, if a goat is decided to be equally intelligent, I will consider it able to give (or withhold) consent.

Predation has always been based on power. In our current society, sex is not based on power. Not directly anyway. I'm not saying power can't make someone more attractive. We're making these laws based on current norms, not those from centuries ago 

I'm against using incest to reproduce. I'm also against grooming. If someone grows up with a younger sibling and they end up wanting to bang, there is a strong possibility that some grooming was involved. It's a much different relationship than childhood friends, before you bring that up. If it was somehow proven that these two siblings are truly legitimately attracted to each other, I say go for it. But don't bring a poorly functioning child into the world unless you can scientifically prove that you're not any more likely to do so than a non incestuous couple
maybe the answer is to make more things illegal. Like BDSM and foreplay. Only missionary. Maybe doggie cos animals do it so it is considered natural.
Gay relationships are not normalized in the US. Great strides are being made *legally,* but gay pride parades are essentially a celebration that they haven't been beat down yet. They are part music festival, part protest, part celebration, part group therapy outreach, and a huge beacon of hope to those who feel like surviving one more day in a homophobic world is just too much. Suicide rates are still very high among LGBT+ folks, especially teens. Equality is a marathon, and it's not near done, especially for minority persons, especially regarding social violations such as bullying/harassment, assault, child abuse, workplace discrimination, etc inflicted on persons suspected of being gay or trans.

There's a lot of reasons why a safe-zone festival celebrating *a sexual orientation* would be the craziest thing ever.
Actually there's evolutionary adaptations against incest so most people won't engage in incest

You seem to be saying that unjust laws can be justified for social good - but only up to a point (which is why you endorse eugenics in some situations but not others)
&gt;Gay relationships are not normalized in the US

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/05/23/same-sex-marriage-poll-americans/638587002/

"More than two-thirds of Americans say they support same-sex marriage"

Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination.

For example:

"Biological and genetic factors in the causes and development of homosexuality might also predispose homosexual people to developing psychiatric disorders. This is in line with the higher prevalence of bipolar disorder we found in homosexual men compared with heterosexual men, which is generally considered to be largely congenital... The fact that homosexual men showed higher prevalence rates of disorders that are characteristic for women in general, whereas homosexual women showed higher prevalence rates of disorders that are characteristic for men in general, is in line with the theory that sex-atypical levels of prenatal androgens play a major role in the causes and development of homosexuality"

In other words homosexuality could make one susceptible to mental disorders through biological and developmental channels, rather than purely through discrimination. (http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/1/85)
Yeah. But of the incestuous few, they run an unnecessary risk to society of producing low quality offspring. Statistically, if not in one generation then two, if not three, they are far more likely to produce a burden on society. I'm all for them having their fun, but not if I have to pay for it.

Obviously unjust laws can be justified. That makes them just. Just also means fair. It is fair for you to give me $3 for a plate of chicken rice. It is not fair for you to give me $30 for a olate of chicken rice. Even though it's still exchange of money, one is fair and one is not. But since the difference is purely quantitative, the slippery slope applies. Over the years, price of chicken rice increases. We know this as inflation.

I endorse eugenics to the point that the bebefits outweigh the cost. Do we really need to evolve? Not really. But should we do what we can to curb genetic diseases? I would say yes. You're free ti say no. As far as I know, it has been scientifically tested and confirmed that incest runs a higher risk of problematic offspring. It has not been scientifically tested that any given couple has an increased risk. A sample size of 1 or 2 can be put down to bad luck. Therefore, I will not ban them. I'm making my decisions based on science, not luck.
&gt; Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination.

How disingenuous to act like LGBT individuals don't face more discrimination in more conservative states.

&gt;In other words homosexuality could make one susceptible to mental disorders through biological and developmental channels, rather than purely through discrimination. (http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/58/1/85)

'Homosexual people tend to experience more mental health problems than heterosexual people, research indicates. Discrimination may contribute to the higher risk, believes lead researcher Dr. Apu Chakraborty of University College London, UK.'

https://psychcentral.com/lib/higher-risk-of-mental-health-problems-for-homosexuals/

'Several studies suggest that gay men, lesbians and bisexuals appear to have higher rates of some mental disorders compared with heterosexuals, although not to the level of a serious pathology. Discrimination may help fuel these higher rates.'

'A new study of gay and lesbian youth finds that they are only slightly more likely than heterosexual youth to attempt suicide, refuting previous research that suggested much higher rates.'

http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb02/newdata.aspx

'Societal changes have led to legal, policy, and structural changes, most of which will ultimately improve the lives and mental health of LGBT youth. But structural change takes time, and in the interim, individual LGBT youth need support and care in order to thrive. There have been important advances in theoretical understandings of LGBT lives, most notably through the framework of minority stress. These advances, and associated empirical research on key mechanisms and processes, point to the relevance of approaches that directly address and interrogate minority stress in the lives of youth and how minority stress processes affect youth well-being.'

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887282/

'While dealing with adolescents and young adults with emotional distress, one should keep in mind that a stigmatized sexual identity could be causing this distress.'

https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp-rj.2017.120505

It's funny how mental health professionals advocate for less discrimination to help with mental health outcomes when you're arguing for the opposite. Why is that?
Not sure how "Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination." somehow became LGBTs not facing more discrimination in more conservative states

And it's funny how when I use the word could in "homosexuality could make one susceptible to mental disorders through biological and developmental channels, rather than purely through discrimination" (see, I mentioned discrimination too), it somehow means something different from the word may in "Discrimination may contribute to the higher risk" and "Discrimination may help fuel these higher rates" (notice that they didn't acknowledge reasons other than discrimination, at least in those extracts).

Actually scratch that. Your last link uses "could" too - "a stigmatized sexual identity could be causing this distress".

It seems words mean what you want them to mean

Also you want to have your cake and eat it. First you claim LGBTs face a lot of discrimination. Then you point to evidence that they are only slightly more likely to attempt suicide. So what is your point? Besides trying to prove that I'm wrong  for the sake of it

Also somehow now you're claiming that I'm arguing for more discrimination against LGBTs. You must be psychic because I never said that. Well, actually if you're psychic your powers are faulty because this is a bizarre claim that I do not hold
Well, I don't think many other gay rights supporters would endorse eugenics. You are certainly a rare sort

Not sure how a justified unjust law becomes just? Then it's not unjust in the first place?!

$30 chicken rice - have you been to Chatterbox? If people are willing to pay $30 for chicken rice I'm not sure why this is unjust. Inflation doesn't work that way

You seem to be a consequentialist. Just note that that is not the only possible or just moral system.

Here is some "scientific" information for you on why we should ban some non-incestous couplings:

- A couple who has had one kid with Down's Syndrome and one parent is a 'balanced translocation' carrier to chromosome 21 (21/21) (100% recurrence risk) (https://www.babymed.com/info/recurrence-odds-down-syndrome)
- People with gene defects leading to Huntington's disease (https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/huntington-disease#inheritance)
- Couples where both parents are Tay-Sachs carriers (https://www.genome.gov/10001220/learning-about-taysachs-disease/)
&gt; Not sure how "Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination." somehow became LGBTs not facing more discrimination in more conservative states

That's because one of the reasons suicide rates are higher is absolutely because of discrimination as per every credible mental health organization. It's highly irresponsible to discount that.

&gt;And it's funny how when I use the word could in "homosexuality could make one susceptible to mental disorders through biological and developmental channels,

Lmao, talk about being disingenuous again. This statement is not the same as:

'**Biological and genetic factors** in the causes and development of homosexuality might also predispose homosexual people to developing psychiatric disorders.'

Please try again. The quote from the article makes no reference to external factors like discrimination. Unless you're arguing that discrimination construes a biological and genetic factor?

That being said, I'm glad we agree that we should reduce discrimination to improve the mental health outcomes of our LGBT community. By that, I'm taking it that you support repealing 377A and legalizing same sex marriages, right?

&gt;It seems words mean what you want them to mean

In your case, sure, because look at how ready you are to twist words just to suit your narrative. Tsk.

&gt; (notice that they didn't acknowledge reasons other than discrimination, at least in those extracts).

It couldn't be that most mental health organizations agree that discrimination and stigma are the main cause of the difference in mental health outcomes. Nah, I'm sure there's some conspiracy behind it.

&gt;Also you want to have your cake and eat it. First you claim LGBTs face a lot of discrimination. Then you point to evidence that they are only slightly more likely to attempt suicide. So what is your point? Besides trying to prove that I'm wrong for the sake of it

I'll break it down for you since you lack basic comprehension:

1) Suicide rates in LGBT youth are higher, albeit the difference is not as significant as once thought.

2) Discrimination and stigma contribute to poorer mental health outcomes for LGBT individuals.

3) Poorer mental health includes increased susceptibility to mental illnesses, in which higher suicide rates is one of the consequences.

I'm not sure how that was so hard for you to process, but okay. 

&gt;Besides trying to prove that I'm wrong for the sake of it

Not really, I'm merely trying to correct someone twisting the results of a scientific study in order to push a misinformed narrative.

&gt;Also somehow now you're claiming that I'm arguing for more discrimination against LGBTs. You must be psychic because I never said that. 

Do you support retaining 377A and legalizing same sex marriage? If not, you're absolutely complicit in perpetuating discrimination. Why spend so much effort to hide your position?
The 377a have more significant impact that you think, it is withholding the legalisation of same sex marriage, applying flats and laws to prevent homophobic discrimination.
Actually homophilic excesses are turning me off gay marriage
Most people act on gut feeling. I try to come up with a rule and test it. If the rule has exceptions, I try to explain them logically. If I can't, the exception is invalid and the entire rule must be reworked. I have yet to find a reason to ban incestuous fun. Unless it falls under a different rule, such as don't groom kids.

Come on, obviously I'm not talking about super atas chicken rice. Or paying for delivery. That's paying for not having to walk, not for the food itself.

I'm glad that I'm noticeably consequentialist. My personal system is derived from consequentialism, but I give value to emotions. I used to be pure consequentialist, but that had its problems. For example, purely logically, Stalin was irrefutably right to force people into horrible working conditions for the good of the USSR. But it was clearly a great wrong. So there must be a reason. The only way I can justify calling Stalin a bad man is by shifting the ultimate goal of existence from technological advancement to happiness. And that makes far more sense. 

I believe that all people must work toward a goal. That is my most fundamental belief. Therefore, only a moral system that is goal oriented can be valid. Deontology is based on the journey. But in the past few years, I've been unable to come up with a journey that's worthwhile unless it has a worthwhile goal. Sometimes the journey is the goal. But the common factor is still the goal, even if it's not a single lump sum payoff at the end. My system includes some traits that seem deontological on the surface, but on further analysis are revealed to be consequentialist. 

For every question, I have to ask 'why' and question the answer again and again until a concrete reason pops up. 'Because it's right' isn't a concrete reason because right is subjective. But happiness is not. If you're happy, nobody can make the argument that you actually aren't. There id an absolute amount of dopamine in your brain. That's a concrete fact.

All laws infringe on personal freedom. Therefore all laws are unjust. However, they also improve society in some way, supposedly. If the latter outweighs the former, then they become justified.  The only way to say a law is unjust is to say that the freedom it sacrifices is worth more than the safety (or etc) that it grants. This is subjective. 

If I were a dictator, I would ban any couple who is unable to have normal offspring from having children. Unless they can find a way to have normal offspring. Or if they have a significant chance to have a defective child, I would ban them too  if that was scientifically proven. But again, if they solve their problem, then go ahead.

However, if I were a democratically elected leader, and I believed myself to be the best man for the job, I wouldn't do this. Knowing that it would make me lose the next election, the good I could do with other policies outweighs the loss of 'goodness' by allowing more instances of genetic diseases into the world. I could implement a less heavy handed approach, but I can't think of one right now. If I actually thought I could solve all the world's problems, I'd go into politics.

Oh and one more reason I won't support practical eugenics (I support the idea, but it would never work). Just like the reason communism fails, and capitalism allows poverty, because people suck. Who gets to decide what's bad enough to be banned? Cerebral palsy is pretty bad, I think everyone would agree the world would be a better place if we eradicated that. But what about a citrus allergy? Is that bad enough to take away someone's right to have kids? I don't think so, but I'm not going to be the dictator. Whoever becomes the dictator might disagree. By my own judgement, I think I could fairly decide what is or is not as bad. By his judgement, he thinks the same of himself. And so does everyone. Therefore, my judgement on myself is invalid. I would need an entire committee to decide. And what if the result is decided by a difference of 1 vote? That falls within the bounds of uncertainty. So do we do it then? I can't say. No human can. I don't even think a computer can.  So just like communism, eugenics cannot be effectively carried out by humans on humans. And since we're dealing with humans, I would vote against eugenics even though it is objectively a good idea
Recent history reveals otherwise - [2018](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2018/02/23/in-a-hearing-that-focused-on-polygamy-utah-legislative-committee-approves-a-bill-aimed-at-helping-kids-being-forced-into-marriage/) and [2017](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/utah-gov-signs-law-aimed-at-polygamy/). Also, lets not ignore the fact that for [countries that currently have a form of polygamy legalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_polygamy)  in its country tends to **NOT** have same sex marriage legalised. So its really hard to tell if same sex marriage will lead to polygamy when all you have in your argument is  "a bunch of editorials agree with me, therefore its true".
Certainly one would not expect this to happen straightaway.

When women's rights were being campaigned for, Mary Wollstonecraft wrote A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. 

To mock it, Thomas Taylor published A Vindication of the Rights of Brutes.

A century and a half after this, the modern animal rights movement got started.

It is notable that in the US's 2015 Supreme Court hearings and judgment, some of the judges mentioned that legalising same sex marriage could open the way to polygamy. Of course you could call court judgments and the utterances of Supreme Court Judges editorials too, but most people would disagree with you (especially if you cannot outline what the distinction between the two cases is).

I never said that gay marriage legalisation was a necessary step for polygamy to be legalised.
I'd argue against consensual sex in the case of adultery (and possibly other scenarios), but other than that yes.
When you're married, consent is not yours alone to give. If *everyone* involved gives consent, I'd be for that too

Summary:
Therefore, I will not ban them.
I don't think so, but I'm not going to be the dictator.
But we as a society are more than logic.
&gt;Also somehow now you're claiming that I'm arguing for more discrimination against LGBTs.
I'm all for them having their fun, but not if I have to pay for it.
First you claim LGBTs face a lot of discrimination.
Not sure how "Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination."
I support the repeal of 377a.
Well, I don't think many other gay rights supporters would endorse eugenics.
So what is your point?
Gay sex is slightly deviant

3.
I used to be pure consequentialist, but that had its problems.
&gt; Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination.
The point is that all consensual sex should be allowed.
&gt; Not sure how "Suicide rates being high among LGBT+ folks doesn't necessarily mean that they are facing discrimination."
Therefore all laws are unjust.
So there must be a reason.
Regardless of how deviant or not you think gay sex is, that's not the point.
Gay relationships are not normalized in the US.
I don't even think a computer can.
So do we do it then?
&gt;In other words homosexuality could make one susceptible to mental disorders through biological and developmental channels, rather than purely through discrimination.
I believe that all people must work toward a goal.
I try to come up with a rule and test it.
Discrimination may help fuel these higher rates.'
