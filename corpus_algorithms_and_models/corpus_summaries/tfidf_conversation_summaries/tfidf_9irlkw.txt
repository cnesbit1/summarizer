According to Christian traditions about the Resurrection period, Jesus would create a theocratic autocracy, eliminating American democracy. How many Christians really want that?
*raises hand*
Over my dead body.
Marantha!
It’s going to happen and I wouldn’t recommend rebelling against God. It never ends well. Besides, He loves you and knows what is best for all us. I’ll take Jesus over any individual or system of men.
Many Americans have fought and died to uphold the principles this country was founded upon, against enemies foreign *and domestic*, I don't see why this situation would be any different.
If it was the divine Christ ruling with the aid of glorified saints as incorruptible judges? Great.

If anyone but Christ tries to implement it I'll fight them to my dying breath.
If hostile space aliens want to pacify and enslave Earth, they should definitely impersonate a religious figure.
Well, it's been prophesied. The Battle of Armageddon. Everyone fighting against God dies in an instant. He is not the enemy rather it is Satan, the one that is deceiving the world into adopting this exact attitude. Don't fall for it.
Right, I don't see God as an enemy, I don't even think he *exists* (nor Satan, for that matter).
This exact narrative is being pushed in the media to rally people to fight against God. Just look at the Avengers movies. The Satanists want you to believe God is like Thanos and needs to be defeated by enhanced humans (transhumanism).
God does exist and He loves you... He wants to save you from destruction.
Yes, that was the message of Infinity War. Deicide.

Not to try and stop an insane person from literally wiping out half of all life in the universe, it was all about killing God. How was I so blind?!

Summary:
God does exist and He loves you...
Everyone fighting against God dies in an instant.
How many Christians really want that?
