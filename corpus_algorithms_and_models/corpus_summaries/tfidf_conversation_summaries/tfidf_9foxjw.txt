Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

The General Discussion thread is for running, Diaz, and drinking water. I'm wondering what's your water technique? I usually go bottle but I have used glass. One time in Peru I drank out of a bag but shit got super weird after that so that's a permanent no from this guy.
Never have I ever chugged water out of a glass without looking like I just downed das boot
I've always used my 1L hiking water bottle I've had since I was 14. 

I don't run with water though, that is for SPINELESS RATS. We go hard out here. Water is the reward
&gt;SPINELESS RATS

Like the huge blow up one that was on the corner of central and washington for weeks?
Why are you such a don?

Real ALPHAS drink water from the skulls of their defeated opponents only after the hard work
When are we hitting that early evening 8k?
God I wish I was you
Weeeeell.... It's 3:30am est, and you're awake for some unknown and highly unusual reason, responding to my comments and posting your comments in a place where I'm known by you to frequent, a place which you haven't appeared in until somewhat recently...

I believe you.

It's 10:40 here my man. 

I've been around here for a while now. This is my third account. FOOK THE MODS (but not really mods are dons)
I'm cool with all the dons.
You're in EET?
