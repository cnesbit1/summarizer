All the downvoters from Friday when I said I was going to sell at 6700 and buy back in at 6200. Where are you now? It has been doing this same pattern for 2 months. If it goes up 5% in one day you sell. You don't sit and wait for it to possibly keep going up to 12%. Then when it drops down 5% in a day - you buy. 

I know no one can predict the price of bitcoin and it could do something crazy at any time, but this has been pretty consistent now and is an easy way to make money.

When you’re day trading with small amounts, it may work. When dealing with larger amounts it’s better to hold long term. I’m sure you’re also trading with your coin and not on leverage. Correct me if I’m wrong.
Still not close to 6200, You may as well buy back in now before youre forced out of the game or have to buy back in at a loss
Don't worry about the haters, you keep making your money.
I FOMOed way too many times in the past and lost on fees and buying back in, before realizing that if I just sit tight it should come back around. Have a stop limit set at 6250 to buy back in. If it goes up over 9.5k then I'll accept the loss and buy back in.
and in a day you could lose all your previous gains, thats how much you can "predict" crypto.
Just use a stop loss and keep moving it up
Your post said you sold at 6500... Ouch
Trading at this early stage is like getting out at $20 with a 200% return.

Nobody knows where this goes. Hodl.

Save your premature ejac...err... celebration, young man. It hasn't hit 6200 yet.
Dude, why do u bother to argue with those hodltards... They are emotionally attached to Bitcoin...

Summary:
If it goes up 5% in one day you sell.
If it goes up over 9.5k then I'll accept the loss and buy back in.
Then when it drops down 5% in a day - you buy.
