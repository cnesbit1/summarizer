IRS Commissioner **John Koskinen**testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform on March 26, 2014. Koskinen told **Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT)** during the hearing that Lois Lerner’s emails [**were archived**](https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/statuses/477582460146823168) and it would take a long time to retrieve them.

**In June 2014 the IRS told Congress** [**Lois Lerner’s emails were lost**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/06/after-a-year-of-delays-irs-says-they-lost-lois-lerners-emails-in-computer-crash/) **in a computer crash.**

But [**thousands of emails were later recovered**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/04/inspector-general-recovers-thousands-of-missing-lois-lerner-emails-that-irs-chief-said-were-lost/) by an Inspector General that were not previously produced for Congress.  
**The IRS leadership was targeting conservatives and lying about it to Congress.**

The emails confirmed Lerner [**funneled information on conservative groups**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/04/boom-emails-confirm-lois-lerner-funneled-info-on-conservative-group-to-democrat-cummings/) to at least one Democratic lawmaker.
I think you can get more people to understand the seriousness of this by, rather than saying it was “worse than Watergate”, pointing out that not only is using the IRS to target political opposition not “no big deal” ( as Obama sycophants would argue) it was actually specifically mentioned in one of Nixon’s articles of impeachment as a reason Nixon should be removed from office.
Woah....
There was no evidence ever found that linked Obama to what the IRS did and no criminal charges. 

Here is the final settlement for a civil lawsuit, not a criminal case.

There is a difference, Nixon was recorded directing his administration to  use the IRS to target his enemies.  

That along with covering up the two burglaries of the Democratic Headquarters at the Watergate building.
&gt; There is a difference, Nixon was recorded directing his administration to use the IRS to target his enemies.

The IRS admitted as much here.
No criminal investigation was done, so how would there be criminal charges?
The Republican Congress, led by Darrell Issa, conducted a long investigation and did not recommend any criminal charges,  the DOJ's Inspector General found no criminal activity. 

There were no criminal charges because there was no crime, thus the tea party folks filed a civil lawsuit claiming they had been picked on.
No they did not.
Yes they did.
Here is the preliminary, final settlement, would  you point out where the IRS says they targeted enemies? 
That would have been  a crime, this is a civil lawsuit.  There was no criminal case.

Oh wow the Deep State didn't investigate one of their own, shocker.
There were two investigations, and there is a new administration and if you want a politically driven investigation, tell your U.S. Congress person or U.S. Senator to conduct one or order one.
["The #IRS is consenting to a court order that would prohibit it from ever engaging in discrimination again."](https://aclj.org/free-speech/victory-in-proposed-settlement-irs-admits-wrongdoing-apologizes-for-targeting-tea-party-and-conservative-groups)
Oh I would imagine that is part of their directive anyway since politicizing it is already a crime. (*there/their)

But I would bet my game tokens the current administration will be directing the IRS to target liberals and Democratic. 

And  you would applaud them.
Its all a show, don't you realize that? They pretend to investigate but really there was never any chance they were going to be held accountable.
That was a Republican Committee led by Darrell Issa, who promised the nation he would impeach Obama.  If you remember the week the investigation opened there were , "Impeach Obama," demonstrations all across the U.S. including the town I lived in where a group set up in an empty lot by the post office, with a table and a huge sign. 

The town drove by and hooted at them, until they gave up. 

Here are some clips and photos from then.

In addition to that there was a DOJ IG investigation. 

No crimes found. 

Some other groups hung big signs from overpasses.
The fact that he is a Republican is meaningless. The Deep State doesn't care about party lines.
I don't know which deep state you are referring to, do you have a general description?
Figured by now youd get theyre all on the same team
then what’s the point of targeting them lol
tHe BaD oBamA oNe!!

Summary:
There was no criminal case.
That would have been  a crime, this is a civil lawsuit.
There is a difference, Nixon was recorded directing his administration to  use the IRS to target his enemies.
**The IRS leadership was targeting conservatives and lying about it to Congress.
