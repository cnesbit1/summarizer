Original Response:
I'm hoping the armor changes quite a bit while upgraded.  That medium armor, while thankfully not a trenchcoat, seems so... plain.  That heavy chestpiece, though.  Looks so good!
They did say upgradeable so it's likely the basic version
Or its showing the finished version where the first ones are more stripped down.
You say plain like it's a bad thing. I've been begging for some more simple, realistic armor sets for years now. Not everything has to have 3 foot long spikes, skulls all over it, and buckets of particle effects dumped on it.
There's a difference between "plain" and "realistic," though. You can have a realistic piece of armor that happens to have some interesting layering or details.  The chest piece looks like all the detail it really has is a scale print.  The rest of the parts are just... bland.  Granted, the character model it is on looks like a featureless marshmallow, so that doesn't help sell it, either.
  
And this is coming from someone who, while playing a Charr, intentionally selects armor parts that shy away from being bulky or obnoxious.
Fair point, but also keep in mind that this is upgradeable armor, so we could just be looking at the very basic first tier of it and it'll become a bit more intricate as it's upgraded.
Dye channels may improve the look; I couldn't stand the light anniversary armor, but dyeing it differently made me like it a lot more.
That's what I am hoping for, as well.  The lack of trenchcoat is a nice start, though!  The parts I have the most difficulty finding, though, are interesting (but not bulky) shoulders that don't float or overly clip.
They wouldn't show the final version
Why not?
Because to leave it as a surprise?
