Original Response:
The Moral Argument is as follows:

P1. If God does not exist, then objective moral duties and obligations do not exist.

P2. Objective moral duties and obligations do exist.

C. Therefore, God exists

This post is for debating P1 of this argument. P2 is assumed to be true. Attacking P2 is out of scope, and responses attacking P2 will be downvoted and ignored.

Further, the argument is deductively valid.

- P -&gt; Q

- ~Q

- Therefore ~P

To those who reject P1, I ask, (Q1) where do objective moral duties and obligations come from if not from God, and what makes them objective?

Because I suspect no good answer can be given to this question, I suppose that P1 is true. I will respond to the answers given to the question Q1.

Edit: Someone asked for clarification on "Objective moral duties and obligations"

I mean that there are actions which should (or should not) be taken in any given situation. These are objective because they apply to everyone.

For example, you have a duty not to kill someone who is not threatening your life or another's (that is, all people share this duty).

Edit: I am not physically capable of responding to so many responses. I don't have the time. If I don't respond to you, I'm not just ignoring your response.

Summary:
Objective moral duties and obligations do exist.
