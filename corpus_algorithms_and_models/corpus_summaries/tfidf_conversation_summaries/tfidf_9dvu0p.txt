Original Response:
I see Christians use this term a lot in their apologetics. They over use this like it's already a proven thing. They will have to show reliable and verifiable tests of what this soul is or if we even have a soul. Going by the definition on Google to me it sounds like nothing. If they can not prove we have a soul then they should stop using it with their apologetics. 

The burden of proof of a soul is on Christians or any other religious group that believes we have a soul. It's hypocritical or disingenuous Christians think we know next to nothing, little about the conciousness or how it works. Yet they equally or more know nothing about the soul. When in reality we know about some things about our conciousness and we know nothing about this soul they claim we have. 

I think before Christians claim to use the soul for their apologetics they should first prove a soul is even a thing. If they can not prove it then Hitchens'razor never fails.

Summary:
If they can not prove we have a soul then they should stop using it with their apologetics.
