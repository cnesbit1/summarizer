About a year now. Also, I agree. I told her that regardless of her intention, she should try to be more straight forward. Other than this incident, she herself is usually pretty drama free. It's mainly her family that is causing the drama, but our contact with them is limited.

You're making some pretty bold assumptions in this comment. I'm not sure this is actually helping me come to a solution to my current problem.

They are legitimate concerns. As someone older than you I see the validity of the comment.
I appreciate the concern, but I don't think debating with me about the validity of my relationship is helping.
I don’t think anyone wants to debate you, everyone here just wants you take an honest look at your relationship before walking down the isle. Don’t forget, there is nothing wrong with a long engagement.
And a long engagement doesn't neccesarily mean a successful marriage, nor does a short one garuntee a failed one. The length of engagement or readiness to get married is not what OP was asking about.
Long engagement is a suggestion to encourage him to give himself time to get to know each other better. I don’t want to be that person who comes right out with break up. When people come here and talk about their problems they get what they get as far as advice.
I promise you, this isn't a hasty decision. I spent five years in a terrible relationship that ended up being a huge waste of time. I feel like that was enough to give me an idea of what I am looking for. This isn't a decision that I made in an afternoon. I thought long and hard about our strengths, weaknesses, flaws, recurring arguments, philosophies on parenting, religion, the way we handle our money, goals, etc. I'm not forking over a butt ton of money on a wedding because I'm infatuated. I understand the gravity of my decision. I don't make it lightly.

Summary:
I don't make it lightly.
I understand the gravity of my decision.
