Such a weird saga. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a player leave a team in such a strange way.
I'll do you one better. *INB4 why is Gamora comment*

The Kings were about to trade Richards to one of the Oilers/Flames. I can't find the twitter but I remember it had a quote from Chia or Treliving confirming they were able to trade for Richards when Lombardi suddenly cancelled the trade because Lombardi found out about Richards border incident.

Until I find that twitter, here's an article that kind of confirms what I remember:

&gt; It’s believed the Kings were offering two or three prospects (Jordan Weal likely among them) to the Calgary Flames and/or Edmonton Oilers as incentive to acquire him before the arrest. Richards will have suitors should the time come.

Lombardi could have traded Richards away and let him be another team's cap issue but shut down trade talks because he didn't want to screw another team over. Lombardi also had a chance to completely get rid of Richards' cap with the compliance buyout but Richards promised that he would get his game back together. 

Say what you want about Lombardi but the man had integrity and loyalty. Sadly, his loyalty was his downfall as he didn't buyout Richards without any cap penalties when he had the chance. Lombardi standing by Sutter when Kings management wanted to replace the head coach was the last straw.

**P.S. Found the quote I was looking for! It wasn't the twitter account but here's an article:**

&gt;The situation changed quickly. Richards’ name came up in trade talks over the weekend at the NHL draft, but according to ESPN, Kings general manager Dean Lombardi learned of an unspecified incident involving Richards and ended discussion.

&gt;Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli told ESPN that Lombardi “came right over to me. He pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is going to come out. I had no idea.’’’

It's probably less that he didn't want to screw other teams over and more that he would have gotten screwed over even more had he known about it and gone through with the trade.
yeah, I also thought of that as I clicked saved..
It must have been chia.

Given that they tried to sneak Slava Voynov into practice, this is probably more likely.
Seriously what an amazingly bullshit framing of the situation.

It's like selling a house, "Lombardi discovered a flood in the basement, making it seem like more an underground lake than a laundry room. So *out of the goodness of his heart,* he refused to sell his house at list price."
&gt;we would have gotten screwed over even more had he known about it and gone through with the trade.

Too bad you're not Ohio State. Slap on the wrist, everyone forgets what happened within a month.
No kidding. College sports are so fucking awful.
????????????????
When it first came out that Voynov had been suspended for DV, the Kings were having him practice with the team anyway.
Oh, yes I had heard, my misunderstanding was thinking that the kings were having voynov on the ice NOW, becuase of a recent article I had read about him expressing interest on coming back, thank you for the clarification!
I often see people blaming Lombardi for this but do you really think that the GM is overseeing day to day practices? Voynov practicing with the team was likely facilitated by the coaches (and teammates).
Integrity? If he fucks someone over so clearly he can pretty much kiss his ability to operate as a functional GM in the league goodbye. It is truly a job built on relationships.
He practiced once after it came out, it wasn't a regular occurrence
Good pull. I will always love and respect Dean Lombadi for what he did as the Kings GM.
&gt;It's like selling a house, "Lombardi discovered a flood in the basement, making it seem like more an underground lake than a laundry room. So out of the goodness of his heart, he refused to sell his house at list price."

that's a bad analogy. I'll admit, I was biased in my state of mind at the time I wrote that post (recreational cannabis is fun, don't do it unless you're 21 though) but Lombardi never tried "selling" Richards after he found out about the border situation.

So going back to your analogy, it'd be more like: "So out of the goodness of his heart, he refused to sell his house at all"
That is still integrity, is it not? He didn't fuck anyone over when he had the chances to. 

And Sweeney screwed the Kings over by trading Jones back to the Pacific and he seems to be doing fine. Admittedly, it's not the same level of fucking over as what Lombardi could have done with Richards but I don't think other GMs would have minded as long as they are still getting a good deal (in their minds).
Not to mention, it’s not to mention anyone *wanted* Richards (and his massive contract) at the time. IIRC, the Kings placed him on waivers earlier in the year, and got no takers. The Kings likely would have given up a pretty good pick/prospect to a team to take Richards off their hands, so Lombardi took the easier out when it was presented to him.
Eh this is a weird way to paint lombardis integrity. He spent a large amount of time complaining and throwing Richards under the bus for "tricking him." 

He then spent even more time crying about the voynov situation and defending him. Despite the morally reprehensible acts of voynov and the obvious reasons for his lengthy suspension. 

If you want to say he was loyal, that's fine. But you can't honestly say he has a lot of integrity after the voynov incident.
How the hell does this explanation have so many upvotes?
Maybe because I provided sources..

What's your issue with my post? I'd like to hear your thoughts if you have sources that contradict my post.
Hahaha maybe it is because you cited sources. People just blindly upvoting because you wrote an essay and provide a clickable link. 

My issue with it? Your ‘sources’ don’t provide anything worthwhile or validate your points. Example: just because you have sources saying the Kings were close to a deal with Calgary/Edmonton, it doesn’t mean that it was called off because Lombardi was overflowing with “integrity and loyalty”. You provide a ‘source’ and then you go off on your opinion/idea as to why it happened, all this with your homer bias that Lombardi shits gold and can do no wrong. 

Didn’t buy out Richards because he’s overflowing with ‘integrity and loyalty’? Fuck that, he didn’t buy him because he fucked up and he should have. Even he would admit that now. This is a business 

I dont even understand the homer bias tbh. I’d be pissed if my gm pulled this shit.
Oh damn, you wrote a lot. I read it and you have some good points but I'm currently at Disneyland so I'll reply later. Can't spend all my time on my phone here
More like, the house failed inspection. It’s simple, Lombardi didn’t follow through with the trade because the league would have denied it anyway as soon as they found out about the arrest
What’s the ELI5/tl;dr of his departure?
all righty, I'm finally back from my escapades.

&gt;My issue with it? Your ‘sources’ don’t provide anything worthwhile or validate your points. Example: **just because you have sources saying the Kings were close to a deal with Calgary/Edmonton, it doesn’t mean that it was called off because Lombardi was overflowing with “integrity and loyalty”.** You provide a ‘source’ and then you go off on your opinion/idea as to why it happened, all this with your homer bias that Lombardi shits gold and can do no wrong. 

I don't think I've used the word "overflowing"..

But going back to your point about how me providing sources doesn't mean that the trade was called off, it's literally in the article I posted. Hell, it's in the quote I posted from the article:

&gt;according to ESPN, Kings general manager Dean Lombardi learned of an unspecified incident involving Richards **and ended discussion.**

&gt;**Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli told ESPN that Lombardi “came right over to me. He pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is going to come out. I had no idea.’’’** 

https://www.ocregister.com/2015/06/29/kings-terminate-final-five-years-of-mike-richards-contract-for-unspecified-off-ice-incident/

it sounds to me there were trade discussions between the Kings and Oilers for Richards and Lombardi ended discussions the moment he found out Richards was arrested.

&gt;You provide a ‘source’ **and then you go off on your opinion/idea as to why it happened,** all this with your homer bias that Lombardi shits gold and can do no wrong. 

this is true, I was high at the time I wrote my post and let my homerism take over. But I don't agree with the Lombardi can do no wrong part. If you go back to my previous posts, you'll see me shit on Lombardi for his desperation trades towards the end of his tenure as Kings GM. I'm very grateful for what Lombardi brought to the Kings but I'm also very critical of his mistakes:

https://www.reddit.com/r/losangeleskings/comments/92vi00/the_athletic_is_jack_campbell_the_next_martin/e3a0098/

&gt;Didn’t buy out Richards because he’s overflowing with ‘integrity and loyalty’? Fuck that, he didn’t buy him because he fucked up and he should have. Even he would admit that now. This is a business 

Oh, I'm sure Lombardi regrets not using a compliance buyout on Richards. But to say Lombardi didn't buyout Richards because of Lombardi's loyalty is misleading:

&gt;The Kings have decided against buying out the contract of center Mike Richards, according to General Manager Dean Lombardi.

&gt;A compliance buyout would have helped the Kings in terms of salary-cap relief.

&gt;But Lombardi's loyalty to his players runs deep and he heard what he needed to hear from Richards in meetings this week. 

&gt;"As long as he looked me in the eye and made that promise that he would make the commitment in the offseason …Essentially, I have to trust him. Once that deadline goes, we're locked in."

P.S. I'm not sure why you're getting downvoted
I only started watching hockey 4 years ago but has the league ever stepped in and stopped a trade because of legal reasons? 

edit: genuine question, not being snarky
I’m not sure but I and I may be wrong but I believe that would be the case had a trade happened here
&gt;don’t do it unless you’re 21 though

Ahem, *19* here in the land of true freedom
haha. I chose age 21, not only for legal reasons, but I think I saw an article on reddit that claimed most people brains don't fully develop until around 21.

That being said, I do wish we were more like our brothers to the north. Like your love of hockey and poutine, and univeral healthcare.
Yeah, I'd agree. I mean, I don't think the league likes setting precedences in general but how could they not for this situation? I'd imagine they have to step in if they knew the Kings knew about Richards' arrest and still traded him anyway to an unsuspecting team.
My biology teacher always tried to get it through our brains that you shouldn’t drink or smoke until at *least 25*, but I mean, fuck that
Seriously. At 25, most people are out of that experimental phase and in the "I better get my shit together before I end up homeless because I can't afford to buy a shack in LA/VAN" phase.
Right, I didn’t quote overflowing as you saying it. That was just my descriptor, sorry.

But my point was just because there’s an article saying he called off a trade, even with him talking to another gm and saying it can’t happen, does not mean “this could happen but out of the kindness of my heart I won’t let”.

The guy with the house selling analogy wasn’t far off in my opinion. Just instead of the basement flooding give it a more permanent problem, like the foundation has been completely destroyed do to earthquakes or something (sounds like were from the same area so not that far fetched lol). If you were going to sell a house and found out about this information, it is your responsibility to disclose it. If people still want to buy it, it’s on them. If chia still wanted to trade for Richards, Lombardi absolutely would have arranged it. It just seems like a stretch to say a guys taking the moral high ground for disclosing something that he has the responsibility to report anyways. 

As for the non buyout, that seems to me like loyalty to a fault and also shouldn’t necessarily be praised.

Lastly thanks for being so civil, it’s rare in this sub for me. I do appreciate your sources and sorry I don’t have any of my own but what I’m arguing isn’t really curable, more a discussion on the interpretation of the sources.
I think they would step in even if LA didn’t know because it happened while he was still with LA. It’s kinda like a trade happening but then the player fails his physical. This one would be a weird situation but I can’t imagine the league allowing a player to go to another team then stick them with that contract
&gt; If you were going to sell a house and found out about this information, it is your responsibility to disclose it.

oh, of course. But we know there's incidents where a seller did not disclose of a house's major flaw and still sold the house. And from my interpretation of the article above, Lombardi found out and stopped trade talks. Too bad his actions weren't definite enough for us to really know what he was thinking when he stopped trade talks. It would have been a lot easier if he knew about Richards' arrest and traded him without disclosing of the arrest, then we can talk shit about him. But he didn't go down that route so I'm willing to give him a benefit of a doubt.

&gt;It just seems like a stretch to say a guys taking the moral high ground for disclosing something that he has the responsibility to report anyways. 

that is very fair. We're still hung on the guy who helped bring the Kings their first two cups.

&gt;As for the non buyout, that seems to me like loyalty to a fault and also shouldn’t necessarily be praised.

agreed from a business stand-point. But considering how reddit complains about how employer loyalty doesn't exist anymore, it's nice and refreshing to see an employer (Lombardi) trust and care for his employee (Richards). me, personally, that's the kind of guy I want to work for.

&gt;Lastly thanks for being so civil, it’s rare in this sub for me. I do appreciate your sources and sorry I don’t have any of my own but what I’m arguing isn’t really curable, more a discussion on the interpretation of the sources. 

No worry about it, dude. This is the sub that taught me everything I know about hockey. This is the sub I lurked as I first started to watch hockey and watched the Kings play through the 2014 playoffs. I'm very grateful for this sub and I want to see the general attitude/vibe continue to grow and improve. I'm not going to lie, it's not easy sometimes but I try my best.

Plus, you didn't seem like a troll which is why I was willing to take you seriously, haha.

If people still want to buy it, it’s on them.
