Youtube wants you to watch more vids, so it wouldn't make any sense for them to promote vids you wouldn't watch. 

If there's an agenda it would surely promote the left as that's who they're commonly catering to, which your vids are against - So that doesn't make sense.

Going off your recent post history you have a few comments which probably make the algorithm all tripped up. It likely can't detect sarcasm.
Lol.  Youtube's always promoted right wing videos, the whole idea that they're ackshully leftist is just a meme pushed to cover up the truth.
“The reality of the situation is actually only a show to hide the fact they in fact support the opposite”

You can say this about literally anything. How about some actual proof.
LOL holy hell... this is sarcasm right?? You know you gotta put a /s at the end or no one will get it!
Well said.
The right wing slant of the Youtube recommendation algorithm [is](https://datasociety.net/output/alternative-influence/) [well](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php) [documented](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth).
Went straight over your head I see.
&gt;  Youtube's always promoted right wing videos,

to specific users, they test people to see what makes them tick. to categorize people.
The article noted that the algorithm promotes sensationalist, divisive, clickbait-y type content and proceeds to give a single example of this (videos about Donald Trump, a person who is sensationalist and arguably to some, divisive). Most of the article wasn’t even about its “right wing slant.”
Oh, whoops.  Here's [some](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/youtube-conspiracy-radicalization.php) better [sources](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html) then.
