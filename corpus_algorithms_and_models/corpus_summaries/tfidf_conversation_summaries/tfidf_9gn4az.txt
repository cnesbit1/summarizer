Hey, we'd talked a few days ago about me doing some redeems for Poipole codes. Would you still be interested in that?
Yes! I will contact you whenever I have a nice amount of codes (should be by end of today!)
AWesome! :D I'll be around.
Hey foxy. I'll have to contact you later because as of now I cannot get a lot of codes. Even as someone who works for the the place that distributes codes we can get that many for this distribution. Usually we get like 300-400 but this time around we only got like 100 so we can't be so generous unless you get lucky. Even so. What are you looking for?
Ah ok, no worries. I was hoping to do redeems for Poipole codes, but I can wait on those. I was planning on redeeming the codes I get from this trade on my own games so there's no rush.
What kind of rates are you looking for?
Depends on what all you were looking to get done.

For one nature: If it's just Poipole I typically do 1:1 per redeem, but if you were wanting multiple redeems on the same save I'll do up to 3 per save for 1 code. 

We can negotiate on other numbers.
So let me see if I'm correct. For 1 nature redeems its 1 code? Can you further explain on the other thing you said I don't understand. Sorry if I'm just big dumb lol
Nah it's ok, it's a little confusing now that I read it again.

Yeah so for just Poipole on the save, I'll redeem 1 Poipole in exchange for 1 code. 

If you wanted different Pokemon redeemed on the same save (any of the current NA codes besides Poipole) I'll do up to 3 of those on the same save for an additional code.
Oh okay. Well I think I'd just be looking for the redeems of poipole. Hopefully I can get like 8 but I'd have to put aside codes. Is it okay if I contact you whenever I have more room?
Yeah sure that's np at all :D
Hey! I have a lot of codes if you'd be interested in this still. (:
Absolutely!
No problem. Also I'll be doing anoyher series of giveaways if you'd be interested those (: I'll contact you about redeems tonight
Hey! So how many redeems would you be interested in in doing? I think I'd need like 6 max
I can do all 6 then :D
For how many codes again?
1 code per redeem!
And as far as natures and proofs what do you do?
1 nature and any proof besides video.
Can you do stats and wc? Also I'll do this 12 codes for 6 redeems. What can you do as far as language
Sure. I can do any kind of picture proof you'd like. As far as languages, I can do any.
Oh okay. In that case can I get 4? I'm pretty sure they're nature locked, with wc/Stat/date met proof and all within distribution date?
Sure thing. Send codes over and I'll get started.
Kk I will tomorrow friendo
Sending codes! Let me know how they look I cut the bottoms off on all but one to make them easier to fit in pictures. Hopefully it looks good!
Did you still only want 4 redeemed? Specific language or anything? 

Codes look good tho
Oh I gave you 12 lol
I guess I'll take two more. Haha
Yeah I was confused lol. I'll get started on these. They'll all be ENG unless you want differently.
Oh I thought you couldn't do other ones! Which can you do
I can do any language you'd like
Can I get to KOR, two ENG and two ITA
Sure thing :D
Hey, I'm doing a couple other redeems for people, so I'm just getting everything straight. You only want wc/Stat/date met proof  right? Not full redemption?
You can do full redemption if that's not too hard
Nah, it's easy. I actually prefer full redemption because that's what I default to when i zone out and go on auto-pilot xD
Lit. That's all good you can do that (:

Summary:
I have a lot of codes if you'd be interested in this still.
I can do any language you'd like.
I can do all 6 then :D.
Also I'll do this 12 codes for 6 redeems.
I'll get started on these.
Contact me if you are interested in them!
Send codes over and I'll get started.
For 1 nature redeems its 1 code?
For how many codes again?
