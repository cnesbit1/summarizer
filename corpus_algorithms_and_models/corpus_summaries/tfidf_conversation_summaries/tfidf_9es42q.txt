Inverted nipples are great they are nothing to be insecure about, with subs like r/InvertedNipples it's easy to see plenty of people love them.

And like you and you partner have discovered adds some fun getting them to come out.
I clicked on the link. Its says "wow such empty"
You probably don't have your setting set to say you are over 18 and want to see NSFW content.
I... I never knew *thatâ€™s* what it referred to! Iâ€™ve encountered that before and never even noticed! Somehow I thought the entire areola would be concave. Thatâ€™s very subtle.
Look at all the potential customers!

You can browse this sub without having the 18+ settings turned on, you will see any post they isn't flagged NSFW I'm pretty sure
My bad, I thought this was a flagged sub. Just seems like one that would be.
This sub is geared more towards educational than smutty, thus not flagging the entire sub
Fair enough. I get jaded by some things that are flagged like dirty jokes and the like.
Today I Learned what an innie looks like...but a nipple is a nipple..."love for all" nipples attached to a breast ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
Not many women have inverted nipples. I personally have not seen a set of inverted nipples in any pornos or anything.

My bad, I thought this was a flagged sub.
