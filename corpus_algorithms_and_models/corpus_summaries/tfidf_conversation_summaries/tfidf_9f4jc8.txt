Original Response:
Usually just stick to a t-shirt and underwear when I'm in my room, but would it be sexier to pull off a girl's shirt to reveal a sexy bra as an added bonus, or would you just prefer straight boobs? 

I'm probably overthinking this, but hey, I buy cute bras for a reason.

Edit: Thanks guys! Clear consensus seems to be no bra, which is the most comfortable state for both parties. ðŸ™ƒ

actually bras cause the muscles that make boobs curve upwards to atrophy and have no effect on sagging.

Tyoical guy answer .. maybe a pushup bra does but your typical woman does not walk around wearing a pushup bra...
A bra is just a piece of clothing not magic.

&gt;	have no effect on sagging 

Do you have a source on that? Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t believe you, itâ€™s just that it goes against my intuition and Iâ€™d like to see some actual study or research that came to this conclusion.
It depends on the size of the breast, perkiness comes from both the muscles and the connective tissues. Muscles can be exercised to strengthen them, but connective tissues will weaken with age no matter what. 

Muscle atrophy will cause smaller breasts to sag faster (there was a French study on this iirc), bras can cause atrophy but this is often compensated by leading an active life, anything that works the pecs will generally work other supportive muscles too. 

Larger breasts are going to sag no matter how strong the muscles are simply due to weight, hoisting them up with a bra reduces the time that your breasts are pulling on the connective tissues that allow them to be perky in the first place.
