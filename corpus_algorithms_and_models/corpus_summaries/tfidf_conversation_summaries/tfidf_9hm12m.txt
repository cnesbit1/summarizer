Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Boys I've done figured out the UFC 230 main event.

**Conor is going to be headlining both 229 &amp; 230**.

The opponent won't be confirmed but it'll probably be a ranked lightweight or Featherweight moving up. Maybe even a mid-ranked welterweight.

The reason they're not announcing it yet is because it won't happen if a) Conor loses against Khabib or b) the fight is a 5 round war where he takes a lot of damage.

Conor's Octagon interview after beating Khabib will be him announcing his intention to fight the following month, and an opponent name. The king really is back.

**I'm so confident that If I'm wrong I'll delete my account**

Don't @ me, you heard it here first.
Conor won't fight again after Khabib changes his face.
little upside to him committing to this
It seems very possible and everyone is forgetting about this possibility after the announcement of fighting 6 more times.


If Conor loses, he ain't gonna fulfill his contract, he already has retirement money and business ventures to make more retirement money.
If anyone would do this, it's Conor hands down

All jokes aside at the very least he's not making a comeback, win or lose if he ever fights again it's going to be a fight he wants he's not coming back to fight whoever's next.
Welp cant wait to see "SeeYouSoonBoy2" here in a month
This is already #2 :(
For the 165 strap. Love it.
Bro I swear to god I was just thinking the same thing and vice versa if Khabib wins by 5 round smesh or submits him w/o taking damage hes going to call someone out.
His businesses are worth money when he's fighting and winning

A few losses lose the marketability

Summary:
Conor won't fight again after Khabib changes his face.
