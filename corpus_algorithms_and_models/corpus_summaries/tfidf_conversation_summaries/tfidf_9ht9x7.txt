Original Response:
SS  Here is some explanation as to why these marks, "((()))" are supposedly offensive.  I had wondered what the history was.  But I take issue with the fact that some punctuation is now so offensive, anyone who dare use it is an anti semite.  I would like for people to rationally explain why pointing out who is behind the news, why is that antisemitic?  It seems that we as americans, are not allowed to speak of certain subjects, anything to do with Israel or Zionists.
Alot of them use this on their own twitter handles
Before two hours ago I never knew the origin, but I always knew it was just so deeply offensive for reasons that cannot be explained.  It's an hour later, and I still don't have an explanation.  

**I believe it's because it's too useful to illustrate exactly who controls the vast majority of the news and information we get.**
Excellent.  So what's the punctuation for fat white male in his parent's basement?

You get to decide.  Use some flair!

You've got no better reply than that.  You admit it isn't antisemitic.  It's just informative, and that is a problem for the kosher nostra.
No, I used sarcasm to point out that if you only have punctuation for Jews then it certainly is antisemitic.  But you already knew that.  Being obtuse is just the only defense you have. (Not sarcasm, just in case you really do have a problem identifying it.)

I *was* secretly hoping that the punctuation for fat white male did already exist because I know I could get a lot of use out it. (FYI: That **was** sarcasm again.)

You can't look at any major news paper for more than a couple of articles before it's written by a Rosenberg, a Goldstein, a Silverbergstein.  

**People do have eyes.**  I know that is a problem!
Whatever you say, buddy.  You don't even have the courage to stand up and state your true beliefs.  You hate Jews.  Either stand up and state it proudly or sit down and shut up.
I am starting to, because no good ones are standing up to Israel fascism.  You don't have to like what I say in america, for now.

If you don't want to be hated, then act appropriately.  I will not shut up.  Not ever.

Summary:
I will not shut up.
**  I know that is a problem!
You don't have to like what I say in america, for now.
