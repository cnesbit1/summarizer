Are they Indian made?  Ebay available?
Yes actually this is one of the good things about owning a Royal Enfield that you can customize it how you prefer!
The motorcycle I do believe is made in India. There are US dealers though.
I believe he's talking about the time.

Does it even come pre rusted?
I own a Royal Enfield.  I was asking about the rims.
Seems this isn't the thread to shit on Royal Enfield. The internet is a fickle place.

FWIW I considered getting one myself because I like smaller bikes and the price is pretty good - then all the reviews weren't very forgiving so... yeah.
If you don't baby an RE, you will get rust sooner.
RE sells a lot of third party rims here. Don't own an RE, but almost 80% of my riding mates here own REs. Solid motorcycles.
Ah. Ok. That I wouldnâ€™t know.

Summary:
I own a Royal Enfield.
I do like the rims!
