So cleaning ss316l coils in an rda.. I've always heated them then dipped under water, but recently heard that was wrong. So today I just gave them a preheat at 20W until they glowed in a dark closet. Seems to be about as clean as when I used water. Is this the best way to do it? These coils just seem to last forever.
I do the same preheat but run the base of the atty under hot water for a minute afterwards. IIRC someone told you that the water can cause fracturing in the steel?

Maybe... But I blow on the coils to cool them and then use hot water. Maybe I shouldn't, but I'd imagine the issues that were being cited were more related to people burning coils and then shocking them in a cup.
Honestly yeah that’s probably the best way. Rapidly heating and rapidly cooling can make the coils brittle which isn’t great for them. I’m sure there are other ways but that way is definitely better than the water method.
I thought there was another reason also mentioned but it may have just been that. Idk on one hand coils are so cheap it's not like I really mind them dying a bit early. I'm more just trying to clean them as best as possible for good taste. I was using cold water before, I'll try hot water sometime. I used to get a bit of discoloration, like a dark blue on my coils. That would be due to too much heat rather than thermal shock right? Thank you.
So seems like general consensus is to stay away from water? Mind me asking what you tend to do?
I dry burn a little bit and blow on them. After about two or three weeks I rebuild usually.
Cool, thank you. Been using prebuilt coils but I definitely am planning on building my own once I finish this kit.
Use hot water so that there isn't a big swing in temperature.
What kit are you using right now?
It's that 7 in 1 kit from coilology (ss316l). Been using either staple or tricore fused Claptons last week or two. Rda is a drop dead.
Ahh I thought you meant like “yeah once this starter kit is dead I’ll look into it” lol, I didn’t know you meant tat kinda prebuilt coil. Never used coilology before but those prebuilts can be great sometimes haha.
Ah gotcha! Yeah hopefully this thing isn't dying anytime soon haha. The mod is an Aegis Legend, been a solid setup.
Yeah I’ve heard nothin but good things about it lol
This is the way I do it, with just one extra step. Before the low power glow I give it a nice rinse under very hot water, than dry it all with a paper towel. After just a very light glow in a dark room, definitely no quenching it in water right after heating it.

Summary:
Seems to be about as clean as when I used water.
But I blow on the coils to cool them and then use hot water.
So cleaning ss316l coils in an rda..
What kit are you using right now?
