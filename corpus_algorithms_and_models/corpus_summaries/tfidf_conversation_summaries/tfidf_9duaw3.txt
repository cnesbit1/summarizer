Do you have any more pics of the build? What exactly did you change? Any balls ups or tips for someone thinking of doing something similar?
Just buy a ducati desert sled
Desert sled isn’t actually a dual sport it just looks like it is
Probably didn’t exist when this was built
True but neither is the monster, since you're looking to build something similar to OP's bike I thought I'd suggest it as in my opinion it's a better platform ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Didn't you ask for something similar? It's pretty similar to OPs monster build, which wasn't a dual sport either.
This handles better and is in my opinion a better off roader than the desert sled which I also extensively tested recently.   It was also built 8 years before it was released :p
First pic is Clear Mountain, I can't forget that view. Why haven't I seen you around? Also that dirt track, Lacey's Creek maybe?
Pink Grom??  Why haven't I seen YOU around? ;)  Dirt track is up Mt Nebo somewhere
Man you might have! Although all you'd see is a pink blur.

I've done the dirt at Laceys Creek, haven't seen the tracks on Nebo though. Looks a bit rough for my Grom.
Haha, I have no doubt your monster handles better in its current form :P
Beautiful 👌🏻
This is 8 years it's senior

Why haven't I seen you around?
