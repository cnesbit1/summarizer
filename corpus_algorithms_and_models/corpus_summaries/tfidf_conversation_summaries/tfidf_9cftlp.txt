Original Response:
Now go back and do the adventure there, Which consists of doing the very same JP but timed and with the use of the dragon aspect skills you get during the mission to escape with the egg.

If that is the HoT one of course and not the PoF mission one that look similar.

WTF are you talking about?

I didn't downvote and even if i did it's irrelevant.

At no point did i state HoT was a JP. There is an exalted chamber JP in both expansions.
translation: The adventure one in HoT is enclosed at the top. This one is open air making it the jp in PoF.
Which doesn't explain:

&gt; HoT is NOT a JP

Which makes no sense.
I guess the fact that it's an adventure completely negates the fact that it's also considered a jumping puzzle to them.
oh, i don't know of the PoF one at all. Where is it?
Something in the desert sort of having to do with vlast. Ask around for more information.
During the mission where you enter Kesho. The first chamber is a large JP to get to the top.

Summary:
