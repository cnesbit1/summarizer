Original Response:
Consequence of Determinsim: If we were to say that the words we are going to speak are determined by chemical reactions in our brains, the words/sentences we speak is expected to be nonsensical.

The reason to think so is that the reactions in our brain doesn't care about whether  the speech makes sense or not. The reactions are simply a result of the laws of chemistry.

Apparently this isn't the case, our speech is coherent (makes sense) which i find to be a case against determinism.

Thoughts?
