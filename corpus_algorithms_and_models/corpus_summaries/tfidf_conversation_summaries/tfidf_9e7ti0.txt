Original Response:
can anyone help me with the smok g150? its not charging for me at all and when i search online I can find hardly any info about it, i thought it might need an update but i cant find anything online
if it's not charging,  it's probably dead.  has it been awhile since you used it?
Its brand new
so it did work or never did? sorry..... if it's brand new,  i would return it as DOA...
never work just says its charging but percentage wont go up, smok seems to have nuked it off its site
ok,  so it's absolutely DOA.  Where did you get it?  I would return ASAP.
If it says it's charging why couldn't his batteries just be shit.  

Use an external charger to test them.  Then use that all the time
Because the G150 is an internal battery mod.
because it's an internal battery mod.
Oh so it's a 150w alien with the door welded shut and the battery attached to wires.

Probably legit
