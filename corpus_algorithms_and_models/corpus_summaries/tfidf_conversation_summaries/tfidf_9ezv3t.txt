Original Response:
People are upset that a man we welcomed into the country, supposedly so he could have a better life, brutally murdered a *thirteen year old girl* who was a citizen of this country.

Imagine that, huh?
no people are upset that you use this one man to blame all refugees
So you suggest we dismiss the group's plea for tolerance towards other refugees?
I haven’t blamed anyone for anything.
Totally what I said, isn’t it.
ok? so then you agree with the article
Didn't say that either.
how about you just explain your point then, are all Syrians to blame for this or not? Cause that all this is about
Is that all this is about?
The article? Yea pretty much
But it's not though.

Your comment was vague and sensationalized enough to leave me wondering if you have more to say about what the article is trying to actually plea for. So I asked the question. No hard feelings, bruh.

&gt; People are upset...

What does this mean **in-context** of the plea proposed by the group in the article? Are these people now going to stigmatize refugees, notably Syrian ones, or not? What is the fall-out of being upset? This is the core issue of this particular article.
I've decided he's trolling me too. Fucking islamophobe. He needs to go to a Peace Camp with me and you.

They banned me once for calling America a shithole, but to be honest, I get banned on a regular basis by people who disagree with my opinions. 

Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if I get banned for telling you why I got banned last time.

No one's blaming all refugees. Are you crying victim yourself is that it?
How are you getting all syrians, how are you getting all refugees ? You're an instigator. I went into your profile and read some of your other comments and there's quite a few of them where you try to Bait reddit readers into saying something racist Etc. You're a troublemaker

Summary:
what is this about then.
No one's blaming all refugees.
no people are upset that you use this one man to blame all refugees.
Are these people now going to stigmatize refugees, notably Syrian ones, or not?
How are you getting all syrians, how are you getting all refugees ?
