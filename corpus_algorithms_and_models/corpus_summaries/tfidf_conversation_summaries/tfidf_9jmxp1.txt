Im rooting for chad's title run now, Aldo was the king and chad was the prince. Now the king has been dethrown.
*The prince that was promised*

I got to meet Chad at the UFC 199 fan village. He signed gloves, and pictures for my nephew and I.  He even spoke to us and joked about how no IV usage equals to getting knocked out easily lol

I'm rooting for Chad, but I feel TAM isn't going to help him win the strap. I wish he was at AKA....man "AKA Chad" would be something mythical
That was the biggest reason I was upset he didn't get a rematch. Eight title defenses which the majority were definitive and it all ends in 13 seconds. Even if you think McGregor would starch him again I still want to see that rematch.
He didn't have 8 title defences, he had 7 or 9 depending on whether you include WEC title defences (I think you should)
I'm there with you brother. #WEremember
AKA or over with ludwig and TJ, TAM has shown time and time again how one dimensional they can be, even if that one dimension gets them far itâ€™ll never get them to the top.
Your on the ðŸ’².

 I said AKA cuz I assume it's not to drastic of a move and the style Cain, and DC have would mesh well with his strengths
Definitely do. There wasnâ€™t even a weight class for the division in the UFC before that.
Prime Aldo was GOAT, crazy speed and power
Ludwig was very confident in a interview that he could make chad a Champion. I dont doubt him, hes a genius.

Summary:
