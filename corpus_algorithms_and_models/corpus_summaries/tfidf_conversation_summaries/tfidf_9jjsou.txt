Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

What are some examples of young upcoming fighters being "fed to the sharks" too soon?
Yair vs Frankie, Oedzmir vs Cormier come to mind recently.
Oezdemir and Darren Till, though I reckon losing to DC &amp; Woodley, respectively, was the best time, place and opponent for them to lose to. A good experience for young talent.
Gavin Tucker vs. Rick Glenn
Pico vs higo, dont @ me
MacGregor - Mayweather
* Yair vs Frankie
* PVZ vs Rose
* Quarry vs Franklin
* Erick Silva vs Fitch
* GSP vs Hughes 1
* Thatch vs Henderson
* Knight vs Lamas
The best example is probably Cejudo, because he took his loss to DJ as a massive learning experience and was better prepared the next time around.
19 year old MacDonald vs Condit
Till Woodley is up here
Pico vs Freeman
No forgay Stipe Vs Ngannou
Schilt vs. Fedor, they thought
Eh, I think Rory showed he deserved to be in the cage with Condit for the first 2 1/2 rounds
Wow I forgot about that one. It was rough.
