Hello guys, i am looking for the NA event codes for latios and latias. I am currently in australia and that's why i cant get them. I can offer good things, just ask in what you interested in.
any 6th gen or previous? how many codes would you like?
What kind of 6thgen or previous pokemon would you like? i just need 2 codes =)
Well i dont know what could you have... Any good natured one?
Legendaries or simple pokemon? xD
Any
yeah, i have tons of competitive trained pokemon, do you have something in mind that you are looking for?
I mean good natured events. Like a timid keldeo, or a jolly rayquaza...
I have a Brave Regirock with 2-3 Ivs in speed and the rest is 31 =). It was caught by me in my Omega Ruby
So you dont have any event for trade, right?
I do, but they are in my omega ruby, since i only play VGC i dont really mind to send them to my ultra moon.
Thas ok for me, i could do the trade in 6th gen, but i need some info about what you have in order to male a deal...

Summary:
I mean good natured events.
