Original Response:
They need to give him a significant suspension for that.  That was ridiculous.
Given his history, anything less than 10 games would seem kinda low.
10 was the number that came to mind immediately to me as well.  Honestly there's no place for this shit in the game, throw the book at him, and anybody else doing this shit.
Shades of Matt Cooke here. Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless.
This isn‚Äôt the nfl. Keep your head up coming in the center of the ice.
Hopefully 14! Then Wilson can't try injure McDavid all year!
His history, and the history of that exact kind of hit.
Even if he'd seen him...how do you prevent that? He was targeted.
You aren't allowed to hit the head regardless. The onus is on the hitter. That's the rule, deal with it.
Damn straight! Real men embrace CTE
10 seems right. Similar to the Matt Cooke warning. And he took the message...for a little while. After this, it‚Äôs Torres time. 30 games.
Yeah and keep those eyes in the back of your head on the lookout too!
&gt; Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless. 

This isn't the NFL. If an NHL player is defenseless in the open ice it's their own fault. The only time that the angle of a hit should decide if it's dirty is if it's from behind into the boards. Otherwise, keep your damn head on a swivel and think before you make a lateral cut into open ice and you'll never be defenseless. The only reason this Jets player could be thought of as defenseless was because he decided to stare down at the puck instead of keeping track of what's going on around him, and there's no reason to penalize hits on unaware players and reward terrible offensive awareness.
If he didn‚Äôt catch his head and caught his body there would be nothing wrong with it. My comment wasn‚Äôt to the hit to the head it was to saying he‚Äôs defenseless and it‚Äôs a blind side hit.
&gt;and there's no reason to penalize hits on unaware players and reward terrible offensive awareness.

Other than the players safety and attempting to limit the amount of careers that are shortened or ended by shit like this, right?

That's simply not true.

Again, simply not true. Humans do not have 360 degree vision. There will always be a blind side, no matter swivel-y your head is.

Ok, you are **CLEARLY** talking about something other than today's hit.

1st, it's a Blues player.

2nd, his head is clearly up

&gt;and there's no reason to penalize hits on unaware players and reward terrible offensive awareness.

Go reread the rule book. The responsibility is on the player making the hit.

That's a reason to teach players how to fucking play contact hockey. You keep your head up and swiveling.

I'm not advocating allowing head shots. I'm saying it's the puck carrier's job to defend themselves from legal hits from every direction. The concept of a blind side hit being "goonish" is so stupid.
Wasn't there news over the offseason that some folks at the Caps/DOPS were working with Wilson to clean up his game and make sure he could leave these days behind? 

Am I misremembering that headline, or is this a case of 'old habits die hard'?
You have to protect yourself at all times on the ice. You sound soft.
&gt; 1st, it's a Blues player. 

My bad.

&gt; 2nd, his head is clearly up 

You might need to watch the videos again. Staring at the puck like a Nazi at the Ark of the Covenant as he's hit. And in the other angle in the twitter thread you can see he also doesn't check over his shoulder before or during the cut. Irresponsible skating, deserved to get leveled. Didn't deserve his head hit though.
If this was a clean body hit in open ice that Sundqvist didn't see coming because he had his head down, it would be clean. That's not what happened. Wilson drove his shoulder straight through his head. The fact that Sundqvist didn't see the hit coming and couldn't brace for it (defenseless) makes the hit worse. By your logic players should be able to decapitate any other player in open ice as long as the player receiving the hit doesn't see it coming.
No, you are not mistaken. It was a big thread here like a month or so ago. I've defended Willy a couple of times but this is the *preseason* there's literally no excuse for something this stupid.
The person I responded to didn't say "wow a terrible hit to the head what a goon." He said:

&gt;Completely blindside, player is defenceless

And I responded to that. I am not in favour of headshots. I just think that too many people don't understand what the rules actually say about blindside hits, which is that they're only illegal if they target the head.

If this was the same hit but driven through the shoulder people would still be complaining about it, because they don't understand the rules or that it's a puck carrier's own responsibility to defend themselves from (non head-targeting) hits from **any** direction. There are tons of comments here where people think that even if video review shows the shoulder to be the principle point of contact and it isn't a head shot he will still get suspended.

You see it every time there is a big open ice hit where the puck carrier wasn't looking around. I don't get it, at all.
[he did that after his two pre-season suspensions in 2017 too](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/capitals/tom-wilson-knows-game-changing-and-his-playing-style-must-change-it)

it evidently has no effect on him
Oh, see what you're saying.  Fwiw, I think that could've been explained better in your first comment, but i do somewhat agree with you.  The most dangerous part of the hit and why it's so bad is Wilson targeting his head, though.
&gt;Go reread the rule book. The responsibility is on the player making the hit.

Not to avoid blindside hits. Yes to avoid head contact (Wilson did not. I do not like this hit) but Wilson had ZERO obligation in the rule book to make sure Sundqvist is ready for a hit coming from the side (obviously hits from behind are covered in the rulebook)

We have a badarse here.
One quick check of post history confirms this.
But the person you responded to wasn't talking about a shoulder to shoulder hit. They were talking about this hit.
I was perplexed when we gave him such a lucrative ludicrous contract.
Here‚Äôs the thing, if your gimmick is hard hits, you will make bad hits. It‚Äôs just the way it is, no way around this.
Wilson is not the smartest cookie in the jar, as a result,  he‚Äôs just awful at his job.
Or is he actually good at his job and his job is hurting people ü§î
Rest of the preseason seems fair.

/s
he broke ZAR's jaw like 7 months ago, and was suspended last preseason too. You can't keep giving him slaps on the wrist.

Woah, I think your Pens bias is really clouding your judgement.
the rest of the season i hope, hits like that dont belong in hockey.
Reminded me a lot of Cooke on Savard, and that is not the kind of comparison you want associated with one of your hits. 

I think going beyond 10 would be a good idea, to set the tone for the regular season and let everyone know the league isn't fucking around.
I think the message stuck with him decently well. He only had 1 more suspension after that. It came over 3 years later and was for a knee on knee while all his previous suspensions were for headshots. Still a dirty player and I'm sure there were some hits that were arguably suspension worthy even after the hit but his lack of headshot suspensions after that should count for something.
Agreed, he clearly does not understand what is an acceptable hit. If they want to suspend him a bunch of games to ensure the message is received, go for it.
It also worked because the team bought in. The institutional support of Wilson in Washington is not going to help. ‚ÄúFuck this league‚Äù, right?
I mean he did it last preseason as well. It's basically a tradition for him.
You are a pedantic POS.  Why bother responding to anyone if you are just going to back peddle on semantics when you realize you are wrong.  Just don't say anything in the first place if you can't even notice if its the blues or the jets playing.  Dumb ass.
Yes, NHL players need advice on how to play contact hockey from you.   haha you are so fucking dumb.  Please don't reproduce.  We don't need any more hockey dads like you hanging around the rink.

**FUCK MATT COOKE**
Wonder if he was laughing on the bench after this one too
At least we won't hear Trotz bitch about the refs this time.
Right what we need at the rinks are more morons like you who don't understand the rules of the game.
Ahh, it's been a while since I've seen this. Fuck him indeed.

Summary:
The responsibility is on the player making the hit.
You keep your head up and swiveling.
I don't get it, at all.
If an NHL player is defenseless in the open ice it's their own fault.
Didn't deserve his head hit though.
Keep your head up coming in the center of the ice.
They were talking about this hit.
Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless.
