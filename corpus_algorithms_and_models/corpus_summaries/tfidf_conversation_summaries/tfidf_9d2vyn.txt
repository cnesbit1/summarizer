Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

this is probably a dumb question, but i appreciate any responses dudes!

Khabib has faced wrestlers in his career, but i don't see him taken down often. When he faced Iaquinta, Iaquinta would rather eat shots and hope for a miracle knockout than try and takedown Khabib. He went into an extremely low stance to prevent takedowns instead of trying some of his own. surely he would have had a better chance timing a takedown, and executing his main strength, right? Is this because of how good Khabib is at grappling?

i'm not too in tune with the dynamics of khabib's style.

why don't fighters try and shoot on him? is it really as simple as fighters are too afraid of it backfiring?

thanks guys

Al was so focused on defending takedowns he was giving away rounds by eating jabs.  It was a last minute fight for him and I think it was a moral victory for him to survive and stop a few takedowns.
He was taken down by Trujillo and by Tibau.
wow. he's an animal even off his back. Thanks for the link!
Iaquinta didn't try to take him down because he was winning effortlessly on the feet.

what he didn't account for was Russian collusion with the judges
Yaquinta 2 4 5
Iaquinta 1 2 3 4 5

honestly I'd give him an extra round if I could
Yeah he 100% won the staredown
Even more amazing when you realise pulling guard isn't permitted in Sambo. Iirc full guard counts as a pin... Incredible
Khabib has very good jiu jitsu we know this from his abel trujilo fight where he was able to flawlessly transition to traingle to armbar to a tight traingle; furthermore in his old sambo videos he is in his guard alot. He also has quite a bit of submissions to his name. people are afraid of going to the ground, in its entirety, because if he can arm trap and reverse you; you are getting pummeled or getting submitted
