&gt; What's the point of even bringing this up if you weren't going to take up the offer anyway?!

Because your parents want to feel like they still have some sort of control over your life and your actions. This is just them acting out in response to feeling powerless over you.
They are actually offering to help me with my living expenses as my salary barely covers those and my boyfriend is currently seeking employment. This conversation made me decide to never touch their money under any circumstances.
That's a really good idea. It's never a bad thing to learn to stand on your own two feet anyway, even if it means you struggle a bit. Money from family almost always comes with strings.
Absolutely, it comes it retroactive strings in my case. Hypothetically would they be right if they were still helping me with my expenses while the bulk was still covered by me?
No, it wouldn't be right, but it would give them an angle to control you.

I went through this with my in-laws. We literally walked away from a free estate home as a 'gift' by them just so we wouldn't be under their thumb.

Best decision we ever made.
Don't waste time on hypotheticals. If you know that your parents would try and make a case that providing for you allows them to dictate what you do, and you don't want to be told what to do (or simply don't want to have to convince people that you should have total agency over your life), then avoid the whole thing altogether.
I strongly suggest you never take their money. Good on you for reaching that decision.
Now make them sleep separately at your house.
Based on your other comments you know they're going to have strings attached to everything. Good decision.
