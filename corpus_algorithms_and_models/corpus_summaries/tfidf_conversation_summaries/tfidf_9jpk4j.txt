Original Response:
I grew up believing Noah's ark literally happened roughly 5,000 years ago.  I'm just curious what the various beliefs are on this and the justification is for those beliefs
Yes, because if it didn't happen, the bible is wrong, and what else is it wrong in? Is Jesus God? Did he rise from the dead? Is he really the only way to heaven?
Now you are asking the real questions! Careful, that lead me to deconvert. Spoiler alert, the bible is FILLED with contradictions.

I sometimes wonder what we will be saying when we are all in the throne room and we all realize how wrong we were about the nature of God.
We wont be wondering anything, we will cease to exist.
Not according to Revelation but the word of God is filled with contradictions and what is in it can’t be trusted right?
&gt;Spoiler alert, the bible is FILLED with contradictions.

spoiler alert, it's really not
There are some truths in it, sure. But yes it has contradictions and is filled with moral, archeological, and historical mistakes.

The reason why I don't really consider myself to be a Christian was started by just one passage and wanting to know the truth. 

Once I realized that Bible was not true, the rest was easy. While I still believe in God and I'd say there is maybe a 10-30% chance that Jesus was the son of God, people need to have the attitude the the person above you had.

Either believe it all, or none of it. But they also need to learn to be objective and think for themselves.
&gt; Yes, because if it didn't happen, the bible is wrong, and what else is it wrong in?

This is 100% circular reasoning.

"The story happened, because if it didn't, the story is false."
You're literally threatening people with eternal damnation to pressure them into believing your theology.

If you can't respond to legitimate questions from skeptics without resorting to threats, you have no business talking to them in the first place.
God is infallible. Man is fallible. Nothing in the Bible is incorrect. Only how we perceive it or interpret it is fallible. Hermeneutics is a skill not a ton of people have studied and applied so we get a ton of misconceptions on what scripture is.
But... who wrote the bible...?
no,.

The story is true, because other aspects of the story  is true.
I guess we miss the point of God inspiring something and it being perfect v man inspired to write and it being less than perfect. If you want to pick and choose what you think is correct or incorrect in scripture, you will have a field day.
But there are exact examples in the bible where two opposite things are said where they can not both be true. For example, Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 tell two completely different creation stories
Study more my brother. The Bible never contradicts itself. God is the same always. And more importantly, He’s never wrong.

I studied the bible under a phd in biblical interpretation and translation. There are hundreds of contradictions in the bible.
[removed]
I take that back. Guess you can study hermeneutics and not see God’s hand all over the Bible.
Just a heads up, archeological and historical evidence support that most of the OT was written under King Josiah by combining local legends to unite northern and southern israel.

Do you believe that Christ died on the cross for your sins so that you will have eternal life? Only reason I ask is because the Bible is a living breathing book. It speaks in ways that I don’t understand but only to those who accept its core truth of Christ being the one true savior. Believe me, it sounds crazy as I write it but I’ve never experienced a book as awe inspiring for communication with God as the Bible.
I used to believe it. 

And the bible is not living/breathing. That verse references the ruach of god (spirit of god). The bible is just a book put together by men.

Maybe it sounds crazy because it is?
I’d rather be crazy for a little bit and have eternal life than the opposite
That is horrible reasoning.
This is the one life you get my friend.
Death isn’t the end friend. I know this as 100% irrefutable fact in my bones.
Okay what is your proof then? (The bible is not proof)
Its a grand claim to say you know something 100%

How is the Bible not proof? How many scrolls have survived more than 4 millennia in its original Hebrew? The most persecuted people in history have been the Jews and Christians and yet the Bible is the most distributed / sold book of all time?

And I also have a personal relationship with Christ. I speak to Him all the time and He whispers back sometimes. It’s not loud. It’s not a burning bush, but He is present. There have been things that have happened to me in my short walk with Him that I can’t explain and that the unbelieving world would just say “coincidence” but I know they aren’t.
Sigh...
I used to have those 'coincidences' too. It is just your intuition. And I dont have the time or energy to address why the bible isnt proof of itself. There is countless amounts of material out there explaining why that is.
[removed]
Well yeah there are countless amounts of material trying to discredit scripture and Christianity in general. It’s why God consistently gets His way for His glory when situations are against Him and His people. So that people would realize that they are not in control. Tell me how you can rationalize Isaiah speaking about King Cyrus (by name btw) in 700 BC but Cyrus didn’t reign in Babylon until the Medo Persians captured Babylon around 500 BC. Coincidence? Josephus the Jewish historian even accounts text saying that when Cyrus saw his name on the scrolls that Isaiah wrote, that this was why he allowed the Israelites to return to their land to rebuild Solomon’s temple.
Because the scrolls were written later than they were credited for. King Josiah had most of the OT written by compiling local legends to unify northern and southern israel.

And the fact is, something can not prove itself. Its the most basic of logical arguments.
So discredit all of scripture then.
No, credit the stuff that can be proven to be true, discredit the rest.
So you know King Josiah made up the writings of Isaiah to help folklore?
Yes. Read The Bible Unearthed by Israel Finkelstein.
Got it.

Genesis 1 and 2 don't actually contradict each other. I'm assuming your referencing this verse: “And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.” (Genesis 2:19 KJV). However, when looking at the root word for formed, it is the Hebrew word *yatsar*, which can also be translated "had formed". This is how many Bible translations (such as the ESV) translate it: "Now out of the ground the LORD God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the heavens and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name." (Genesis 2:19 ESV).
Removed for 2.1 and criticisms of your behavior here seem accurate.

Summary:
The Bible never contradicts itself.
I used to believe it.
But... who wrote the bible...?
How is the Bible not proof?
Spoiler alert, the bible is FILLED with contradictions.
The story is true, because other aspects of the story  is true.
There are hundreds of contradictions in the bible.
And the bible is not living/breathing.
&gt;Spoiler alert, the bible is FILLED with contradictions.

Only reason I ask is because the Bible is a living breathing book.
