I have to get this off my chest. I don't wear gear (beside helmet) when I commute to work. It's a half hour trip through heavy traffic. I don't exceed the speed limit and the most I do is filter traffic. Which is why I ride primarily. I wear gear if I ride with friends because i push my comfort level then.

My justification: law of averages and chances. The more reckless or hard you ride the more you increase your chances of something insignificant ruining your day. Re: stray dog crossing the road etc...anything can happen, but I'm a big believer in the way you ride, carries your chances of something bad happening higher exponentially. See I can't ever head on a car overtaking in a blind corner like yammienoob because I wouldn't over take in a blind corner. He may have done this 1000 times......but got caught once.

Anyway, I feel better now. Thanks for listening. That's my daily confession.
Well this just made me realize there's a good group of survivors here.... thanks for all the feedback none theless.
Road awareness and good riding habits go a long way, but it can only do so much. You might be perfectly fine doing this, you might not. 

Either way, brave of you to make this post! The ATGATT brigade is pretty hardcore here, and I'll be honest, I'm a bit guilty of preaching a bit too.

I personally just think that it's a good idea to learn from other people's mistakes before making them yourself. Much easier than learning the hard way, like a lot of people I know.
