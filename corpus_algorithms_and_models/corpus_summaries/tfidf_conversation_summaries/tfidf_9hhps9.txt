Have any of you seen the [Mueller emails](https://drive.google.com/drive/mobile/folders/1nu7SZvGCr5kZSG1MGj307Sj2uvHxwYHd) yet?

I'm still going through them, but so far they seem like the correspondence between the special counsel and the press.
Apparently these were obtained as a result of a [FOIA request. ](https://imgur.com/a/b7cgy4Y)
And they were using Gmail
Maybe I'm missing your point but.. so?

Gmail with MFA is as secure as any other transmission across https. Nothing intrinsically insecure about Gmail except the user.
Podesta fell for a phishing scam. Email provider is irrelevant.

These emails are all formatted like outlook formats emails.

The emails are a .gov domain.
I checked half a dozen, and they all come from the DOJ domain. The files are on Google though.
DOJ used Gmail to send the files to Freedom Watch via email.
Ahhhhh

Summary:
The emails are a .gov domain.
