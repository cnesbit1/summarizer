And it wasn't months/years ago!
And didn't involve fruit sex!
Coconuts
Or poop
Or a squid head

thanks fam!
what about the guy that fucked and ruined his dads couch?
What?
Damn it will the flashbacks never end???
Wth that’s not rare on this sub. If we’re taking all these TIFUs as true there are plenty where the person lose a great sum of money because of some dumb shit. Sometimes losing a job opportunity, etc
A squid head? Really? :D

Um..I want fruit sex. Please.
Haven't you people learned?
Or a plugged in vaccum
Over in /r/dogs the other day someone asked for help because they actually came on their dog and they couldn't catch him to give him a bath. 

I was really surprised I didn't see it here!

Why the hell did you just assume it was a spam call????
I get on average one spam call per day from random numbers across the US (live in US). Seems perfectly reasonable. I usually answer with “is this a robot?” And then hang up when it is.
I get about one spam call per week, I never pick it up. I haven’t gotten one in over 3 weeks now. Maybe just don’t pick it up if you don’t recognize the number?
I get a handful on most days. It always numbers somewhat similar to my own.
Huh. I've never ever received spam call. But I'm in Europe, that might be it.
Seems reasonable except if you know you're expecting a call from a family member, then it seems you might want to be a little more prudent, no?
Yeah I just got one a few minutes ago.  I get 30 to 40 a month easy.

If I answer them, I’ve gotten to the point where I like to screw them too. Usually keeping them on the line trying to get them to admit it’s a scam since they often aren’t allowed to hang up.

Either that or apparently I am missing out on a lot of government grants that I didn’t apply for.
I get about 10 spam calls a day on average. Sometimes I fuck around with them but I wouldn't pretend to be kidnapped lmao
I started doing this. Voicemail instructs them to leave a VM or text me with what’s up. Unless I’m expecting a call, that works out pretty well for me
Except it was supposed to be at 8 and not 6
IDGAF who you are, if I don't have your number in my contacts, I'm probably not picking up the first time. Leave a voicemail or text me your number first. Spam call spoofing is rampant in the States these days.
Also, how does everyone seemingly get *so many* spam calls? I can't remember the last time I got one, and even when I did get them, my family/friends/SO called me more frequently than they did.
Landline gets more spam
Ah, it didn't occur to me people still had a landline. No one I know uses it. Sorry!
I mean hypothetically if OP was two hours ahead of the cousin, and their father was referring to the cousin's time zone, then it's possible that the phone call happened when it was supposed to.
I guess if one did live in another time zone this would work out for your hypothetical
But how do people get so many spam calls?
It still makes no sense that these people get so many spam calls.
What did you do to get so many spam calls every day?
Applying for jobs.
Surely if the calls are from those jobs they aren't spam since you wanted them so how does that translate to so many spam calls?
Fake job postings. Fake numbers.

Summary:
But how do people get so many spam calls?

I'm not your pal, bud.
