Hi!  I'm looking for a HA Apriball Bagon to add to my collection.  

I have a self-bred Moon Ball Jolly 5IV HA Riolu OT: Phero ID No.: 195140 EMs: Bullet Punch, Crunch, Meteor Mash for trade
I can make one in a quick ball if you want that
Yea that would be great!
Kk give me a few minutes
Sounds good.  I'll go ahead and add you while you're doing that.
Sweet
Sorry for the delay, made a rookie mistake. All set now though
No problem.  I'm in plaza.  Please request trade when you get there.
It has its egg move dragon dance and beneficial nature as well
Trade completed.  Thanks very much! :)  Enjoy your Riolu!
Thank you as well!
