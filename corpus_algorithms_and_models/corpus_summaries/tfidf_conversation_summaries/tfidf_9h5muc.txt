Original Response:
Submission statement; this kind of state sponsored surveillance, done with the willing cooperation of private corporations, is a terrifying threat to a free and open internet.

It would be one thing if the Chinese government had engaged in this behaviour without Google's knowledge, but Google's willingness to go along with the request is the antithesis of "not being evil".
They have a different view and culture in china, it's not really evil. But, it can be abused and it would be disasterous in the west and therefore the fact that google is cooperating in this endeavor makes me queasy.

Not evil?!? How is spying on an individual not evil?

They've been doing the same thing for the United States government for 10+ years. Fb does the same. Tax cut funded.
Semantics perspective... Or is that supposed to be wrote the other way?
It violates trust and privacy. It’s sneaky hence the word “spy”. Those are evil things, that’s how.
No shit LOL.  Reminds me of giving China shit for eating dogs and what not.  Because filling a dumpster with puppies, pumping in cyanide, and shipping it to a landfill is "civilized".  China isn't some Evil Empire... they are doing the same shit as every other nation... why wouldn't you flag citizens based on interest if you had the means?! Governments have done it for centuries... to have it automated is a tyrants wet dream.  Knowledge is power...
Yeah the dog eating backlash demonstrates the lunacy perfectly. Terrorizing, mutilating and eating cows though.. totally fine.
