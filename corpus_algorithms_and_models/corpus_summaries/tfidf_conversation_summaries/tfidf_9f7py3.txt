We are going to Jahai. I've guessed right [1 out of 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9dzq96/which_map_do_you_think_well_get_in_the_next/e5m1feg/)  so far. 

 [The original map is rather small](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-1623.875&amp;y=1227.125&amp;z=3), so I'm guessing it'll include surrounding areas, and hopefully reach all the way to the north in the Chantry of Secrets.
It probably covers all the way between Domains of Vabbi and Kourna, and might link to them as well, through the new Sunspear Sanctuary.
Nah that's too big for a Living World map. Could maybe do it in two, but then why fill that gap when Kralky's come south?
It would be pretty much the same size as Domain of Kourna.
And still be wide enough to have the Sunspear Sanctuary in it? I'm not convinced. They've made the maps long in one axis before (Kourna as a nearby example) but a map both wide enough and tall enough for what I'm picturing is needed hasn't been seen since PoF itself.

Nevermind that the entire bottom third of Kourna is mostly unplayable empty space.
Sunspear Sanctuary will be the upgradeable Sun's Refuge.
Yes? and that's either part of the new map or immediately adjacent to it. Trying to put a map that far west and still get the important landmarks to the east (Chantry of Secrets for example) is going to make it a very wide map. Now try to add in the needed height to reach Vabbi. Suddenly you've made a PoF-sized map, not a LS4-sized map. And I don't see that happening.
What's so wrong about it? They can cover GW1's Jahai Bluffs, half of Yatendi Canyons, and all the other empty space. It's even smaller than Kourna if you discard Mahnkelon.

The sanctuary is probably another map instance, so no problems with that.
Why are you assuming it's going to go west? It's probably going to cover just what lies between Vabbi and Kourna.
Because we're getting Sun's Refuge. The new map will either include it or be immediately adjacent to it. I literally said that in the comment you replied to.
If Sun's Refuge is its own instance, the new zone should be east of it.

Everything north, south, and west of Sun's Refuge won't be part of the new zone.

Summary:
It's probably going to cover just what lies between Vabbi and Kourna.
The new map will either include it or be immediately adjacent to it.
