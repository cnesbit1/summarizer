    Q,

    Did NASA fake the moon landings?  Have we been to the moon since then?  Are there secret space programs?  Is this why the Space Force was created?

&gt;&gt;3094804
False, moon landings are real.
Programs exist that are outside of public domain.

This is the correct response.  

And check out lovehaswon.org.  They think that they started coming in waves starting a few years back.  And if I told you how I came upon that website, you probably wouldn't believe me, too.  That alone gives me reason to partake.
How did you come across it?
Bashar?
Actually had never heard of that before...so no.  But I did check it out.  I am not quick to dismiss channeled things at all, though I would have been much more skeptical a few years back.  There's actually a channeled book about the life of Jesus BY Jesus, supposedly.  Guess what he states that he is literally right off the bat???  A conspiracy theorist!  He saw the hierarchy of society for what it was and didn't like it.  Guess who is being slandered today?
Nice, don't see many that know of him
I'm going to look into that even more.  To tell the truth, I was told about the website by Lilith (or so it seems).  She may be an interdimensional being as well.  Or maybe one of the demons disguised as benevolent aliens talked about in the book of Daniel (there was a thread about this on CST).  I hope she's good.  It seems like it.  

Thanks again for the response though.
Sounded cool, until I read they wanted $77...:(
They don't "want" $77.  I didn't give them anything. 

People can't charge money ever?  How many people actually donate to websites?  I sure as heck didn't.
Trust me when I say that I too have had some incredible encounters in the past 3 years that have completely led me down a new path. Have you heard of Brad Johnson? Excellent channel from B.C

Interesting...past 3 years have been fascinating.  I would say for me Oct 2016-April 2017 was particularly a change of pace...and the information I received during that time really makes me think we are on a quest...an archaeological and spiritual trek for information (and treasure?).

Dude seems cool though...I skipped around a bit and nothing seems out of place with what I have heard/read over the years, especially regarding the (partial) dualism of Earth and how higher-dimensional beings perceive death.  

Thanks for sharing.

Summary:
I didn't give them anything.
But I did check it out.
