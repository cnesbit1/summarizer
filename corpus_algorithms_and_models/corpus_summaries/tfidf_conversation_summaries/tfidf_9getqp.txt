An hero
Why, is the 'h' silent?
[They think they are being clever](https://www.writing-skills.com/hit-or-myth-use-an-before-h-words) but according to this you don't use "an" before "hero" anyway.
I think they thought they were going to co-opt my award-winning comment, but it backfired. :)
It's a reference.

Truly an hero to take the downvotes even when making a solid reference
Old school grammarians figure h deserves the “an.” If you’ve ever watched Frazier you’ll notice the snooty characters all do it (and if you keep an ear out IRL you’ll notice the same thing!)
even when written? first I've heard of this. I know that there are some people who by default do not pronounce the h (for human they say yuman, for example.
I’m not sure, and that’s a cool question actually. It depends on whether it was written into rule or if it was something people started saying out loud to make it easier to say. I haven’t looked into it much, but I’d assume it’s also when written- Frazier most likely wouldn’t adopt it if it didn’t have some kind of pretentious literary placement. 

EDIT- I’m Frazier’s number 1 fan.
man I've been getting owned own reddit lately for grammar. It's humbling. 

ps- major Frazier fan too. My brother and I used to walk around and say stuff as if we were the two of them.

pps - that dude is still an hero.
Eh, anyone who cares about grammar is a goofball imo. If something makes sense it makes sense, who cares?

An hero indeed!
