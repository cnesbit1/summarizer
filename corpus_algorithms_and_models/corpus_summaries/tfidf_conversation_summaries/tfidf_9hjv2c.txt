Interested. What rates are you looking for
And what nature is the marshadow? Is it comp natured?
1:1 is fine. Adamant. I have more Natures I sr'ed for if you are interested. Also, I dont have the cartridge I reedemed on, so I dont have the WC is that ok?
How do i know it isnt cloned?
Also do you have a jolly or naive one?
You don't. I reedemed them my self nonetheless. I have lots of other events w/WC to trade if you don't wanna. Yes, I have naive nature. Months back I was on the subreddit trading for Marsh codes like crazy I have like 7 with BR natures.
