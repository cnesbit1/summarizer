Original Response:
And why were GW and Obama guests of honor at his funeral soirée?  The man lived at least 9 lives and used his death to snub Donald Trump.  The whole thing baffles me.  I wouldn’t snub my worst enemy at my funeral.  I mean, I’m nobody, but I certainly wouldn’t focus my death on Trump.
He was executed for treason. He had nothing to lose.
By who

For what treason

Working with ISIS, White Helmets, helping to stage chemical attacks...for starters
Now I'm not saying you're wrong, but what are your sources?
Don't mean to be dismissive but there have been lots of threads here about it, if you search you will find many sources guaranteed. I'd have to do the same thing to provide you with those sources.
But I want to see your sources
Tough luck, bud.

Snopes says the photo with with the leader of the Syrian Freedom Force isn’t with a terrorist so we’re all good. Doesn’t actually show the photo with NoName and the real ISIS/al queda terrorists.
More like being influential in the founding of ISIS and the bogus FSA
Lol... Snopes has about as much credibility as Rosie O'Donnell.

Summary:
He was executed for treason.
Exactly, what did he do that was treason?
