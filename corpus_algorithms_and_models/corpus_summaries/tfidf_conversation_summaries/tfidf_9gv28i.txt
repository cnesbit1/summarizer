Original Response:
Ducked Ponzinibio to fight Usman? Either Santiago thinks that RDA does not understand stylistic matchups or does not understand it himself well enough to see that RDA just accepted a much, much harder matchup than Ponzi.
If judges were good, I wouldn't say Usman nor Covington would've been tougher than Ponz. RDA is a good anti-wrestler and the best clinch striker in the game, what screwed him against Colby (and what will likely screw him against Usman) is that the judges drastically overvalue inert control and undervalue actual striking (especially from the clinch, with your back to the fence, and body shots, all of which seemed to be ignored in the Covington decision in favor of wall/stall). 

Meanwhile, a good long-range boxer like Santiago is a legitimately difficult fight for RDA, regardless of whether the judges know what they're doing or not. He can strike with RDA and tag him from range, and good boxers like Alvarez have caused problems for RDA (and Ferguson was able to land some good jabs as well, and Ponzinibbio has an excellent jab). I wouldn't be horribly surprised by Ponz getting a legit win over RDA (though I'd still favor RDA), where Colby and Usman's styles generally rely on the judges ignoring the criteria for them to beat a guy like RDA.
I disagree. RDA's pressure would never allow for a long range boxing, he would be in Ponzi's face and Ponzi is no way good enough of a outfighter to keep away from a pressure fighter as good as RDA.

As for the judging, it's not like Colby wall and stalled RDA. He also landed more strikes in the three wounds he won. I am the biggest RDA fan here and would love to do some mental gymnastics to convince myself that he actually won against Colby, but I can't. Three rounds of that fight he was completely on the backfoot and got outstruck.
Oh no its you again, and even with you thinking judges are wrong in scoring wrestling control the way they do (which i understand is not how its suppose to be scored according to the rules) you cant deny that pressure wrestlers are RDAs weakness
I don't remember the Ferguson fight too clearly but didn't he use his longer reach and long-range boxing to great effect against RDA?

Also, nice one for putting aside personal preferences for fighters and giving a pragmatic opinion on who won the fight. It's refreshing to see.
He pressured RDA though iirc, or at least, it wasn’t really an outfighting performance.
Yeah I don't like Colby but he 100% won that fight IMO
I think Tony vs RDA was more of a pressure fighter vs pressure figther and RDA failed to pressure him. Tony wound up being the one to move forward. It´s not as if Tony outslicked him from the distance, he was in RDA´s face. While Tony's and Colby's pressure are completely different the essence of those two fights in not that dissimilar: RDA is probably the best pressure fighter in the UFC, but hates being pressured himself.
Ponzi is a capable outfighter and one of the better jabbers at welterweight. It's entirely plausible that he keeps a shorter RDA at bay, even if RDA decides to pressure; Santiago is tough to herd into a corner. 

&gt;As for the judging, it's not like Colby wall and stalled RDA. He also landed more strikes in the three wounds he won

He landed more, but RDA won the striking regardless by landing cleaner and harder consistently at distance and in the clinch. Numbers don't matter, look at the stats for Cruz/Garbrandt. Being on the backfoot and being controlled against the cage don't matter (when there's a striking differential), and RDA wasn't outstruck, he won the striking through 3 or 4 out of 5 rounds (landing the best shots of 1/2/4/5 as Covington amassed a meaninglessly marginal volume advantage). Covington/RDA was a robbery IMO.
I don't dislike Colby, but he 100% lost that fight IMO.

Given that he got robbed against Covington and should've won that fight, the only data point for "pressure wrestlers are RDA's weakness" is Khabib. And even that was before RDA went on his lightweight tear. RDA has developed into one of the strongest clinch players in the UFC and he's good at defending takedowns, I don't think there's a ton to say that his current form is vulnerable to pressure wrestling if competent judges are involved.

The media doesn't know how to score fights. There's little barrier to entry, and one of them isn't "reading the judging criteria and applying it to fights", so you get half of the media thinking Merab beat Saenz (!), Holm beat GDR (!!), or Cejudo beat DJ (!!!!!!) all of which are *entirely* unjustifiable positions to take.

Well you can certainly agree that rda looked much better against lets say robbie lawler than khabib or covington, when he is pressuring and out pacing guys he is a monster, when he is being pressured and being out paced (not saying he was neccesarally out paced by covington but covington certainly had a very fast pace) he looks not as good, he gets up up against the fence, and gets taken down, and hes not the best at getting back up or preventing this in the first place, its one thing to say rda won that fight, it was close, its another thing entirely to pretend wreslters arent something rda struggles with
Ah, so the judges, the media, and a majority of fans here and elsewhere don’t know how to score fights because they disagree with you. 

Got it.
No, they don't know how to score fights because I've seen no evidence to the contrary. I've had discussions on scoring fights that are based in the criteria, but the vast majority are "***BUT WALL AND STALL AND TOP CONTROL HAVE TO COUNT AT ALL TIMES***", which just shows that the criteria haven't been read by the vast majority of people. The media just submits a score, there's not necessarily a rationale, so there's no way I can know that the media knows what they're talking about. I just can't consider their opinions more valuable than that of the vast majority of people here, who just look at someone on the backfoot and act like they're losing even though they're doing the better work, because the media has established no legitimate authority. 

 I don't know why uninformed viewpoints should be considered at all; get your academics in order and your opinion can mean something in the classroom. Until then, majority opinion doesn't matter, and this transparently fallacious vox pop argument and appeal to authority (as if the media and constantly wrong judges are an authority) doesn't matter either.
He looked better against Lawler, but that's because wrestlers require a different kind of fight. He's able to defend takedowns and get back to his feet with regularity, Covington wasn't able to keep him down, and he just established a wide striking differential in the clinch. It isn't his A-Game, but there's a difference between that and calling it his "weakness".
Well fair, but in me saying its his weakness what i mean is its the kind of fighter he struggles with most
While what I said is in the range of appealing to authority and majority, that’s doesn’t mean it doesn’t have merit. Your point of view can be condensed to “I know what I’m talking about and the majority that disagrees with me doesn’t”. You broadly write off counter arguments to your view as uninformed. You talk about how judges, media and fans have no idea what they’re talking about, but what about all the times (I’d bet it’s easily the vast majority) that they “get it right” and agree with you? Is that just luck or?

Seems like a pretty weak argument writing off the majority entirely like you’re attempting because their views don’t always like up with yours. The majority isn’t infallible, but neither are you. 


At the end of the day, I know this is a waste of time because you’re going to think what it think. But just realize that while you can say media and majority opinion doesn’t matter, else can just as easily write off your entire point of argument in turn.
&gt; Your point of view can be condensed to “I know what I’m talking about and the majority that disagrees with me doesn’t"

My point of view is "RDA/Covington was a robbery". The consequence of that viewpoint is "if you agree with me, I believe you are correct, and if you disagree, I believe you are incorrect". That's just what holding an opinion means. The fact that the majority disagree is not only irrelevant in a vacuum, it's especially irrelevant because the majority can't be assumed to be informed. 

&gt;You talk about how judges, media and fans have no idea what they’re talking about, but what about all the times (I’d bet it’s easily the vast majority) that they “get it right” and agree with you? Is that just luck or?

The majority of fights don't require the criteria to judge correctly. Anyone can watch Bader/Perosh and say "yes, Bader won", and in a pure striking or grappling match, it's not terribly difficult to pick the better striker/grappler. I'm not saying the judges are blind. 

I am saying that they've been consistently incorrect, and so have the media, when it comes to the minutiae of the criteria that would clearly hand the wins to Johnson or RDA; that wall and stall isn't effective grappling and takedowns mean nothing without an attack mounted from them. This can be seen in the media thinking Dvalishvili beat Saenz, or that Cejudo beat Johnson, neither of which is justifiable at all without overvaluing top control. 

 It isn't luck that they get most fights right, it's that most fights don't test the areas that I'm claiming they're weak in, and when those fights show up, the media and judges largely fail (look at fucking Kajan Johnson vs. Khabilov, for a recent example). 

&gt;Seems like a pretty weak argument writing off the majority entirely like you’re attempting because their views don’t always like up with yours. The majority isn’t infallible, but neither are you. 

Sure, but I'm putting out arguments that are backed in the criteria, while no one else seems to be. Just being in the majority doesn't mean that you're correct. 

&gt;But just realize that while you can say media and majority opinion doesn’t matter, else can just as easily write off your entire point of argument in turn. 

Sure, but one of us is right and the other is wrong. My arguments are backed by the criteria, and there's nothing to suggest that everyone else's arguments are similarly backed. If you want to throw out correct arguments because it's a minority argument, go for it.
How though?  I was pulling for RDA the whole time but to me it seemed obvious that he wasn't winning that fight.
RDA consistently landed cleaner and harder with his strikes at distance and in the clinch, and Covington had no effective grappling nor a volume advantage that overrided RDA's better connections (he landed like 12 more shots in a 100+ strike fight and took the way harder blows throughout). Effective grappling is defined by fight-finishing potential in the judging criteria, which inert cage control doesn't possess, and Covington did nothing with his takedowns. Control itself only scores when all else is equal according to the criteria, which wasn't the case; RDA won the striking. RDA 1/2/4/maybe 5.
This guy obviously has some kind of underdog bias. Seen him on multiple subs saying that he thinks the judges are shit and i guess he is the authority on the matter? A close decision? And the judges pick the fighter i dont like? Gotta get on my r/mma high horse and start bitchin
The judges are shit. I'm not an authority, never claimed I was, but that doesn't mean I'm not right. It isn't underdog bias, it's literally just reading the criteria and applying it to fights, which shows that most of the actions taken by Covington just shouldn't have scored at all.
I mean have the judges made bad decisions in the past? Absolutely. But you cant watch every close fight and say that they were wrong. Cejudo vs DJ could go either way on any given night. Colby clearly won the RDA fight, but since people dont like him they gotta come up with excuses. ( coming from a colby fan who really thought RDA was gonna run through welterweight and win the belt )
&gt; RDA 1/2/4/maybe 5

So Convington won only one round? Lol.
His only really decisive round was 3 IMO. Covington could've won 5, but RDA still landed the best shot of the round and Colby didn't have a great volume advantage. I had it 48-47 RDA with 1/2/4 but 5 was close as well.
If you actually think that colby lost that fight then you are delusional
If you think it takes delusion to score that fight for RDA, you haven't read the scoring criteria.
how does a judge score 1 for RDA then 4 for covington????
&gt;you cant watch every close fight and say that they were wrong

I don't. Some decisions are plainly and embarrassingly incorrect, though. 

&gt;Cejudo vs DJ could go either way on any given night.

Johnson deserves that win 10/10 times. He won the striking and Cejudo did nothing with his control, so it doesn't score as effective grappling. And control doesn't score with a differential in effective work, which was on DJ's side. That fight was very clearly for Johnson. 

&gt;Colby clearly won the RDA fight

Same rationale. Covington lost the striking, RDA consistently landed cleaner and harder and Covington had a marginal volume advantage that didn't come close to offsetting RDA's better connections at distance and in the clinch. At that point, control doesn't matter, and Covington did nothing with his positional victories so they aren't effective grappling.
&gt; The consequence of that viewpoint is "if you agree with me, I believe you are correct, and if you disagree, I believe you are incorrect"


Except you’re saying because people don’t agree with you they don’t I know what theyre talking about. Not that you don’t agree with their opinion, but that they are objectively wrong and uninformed. That’s not a consequence of holding an opinion, that’s a consequence of believing no one else’s viewpoint could possibly be as informed as yours. I’m not going to dive deeper into your comment just to keep going round and round with you about this because you’ve made it blatantly obvious you don’t care what anyone else thinks. That’s fine, it’s your prerogative, but we don’t dont exist in a vacuum and in reality your opinion is just that, an opinion that at its best carries no more weight than anyone else’s. Have a good one.
&gt;Except you’re saying because people don’t agree with you they don’t I know what theyre talking about

No, it's the opposite. The vast majority of people haven't read the criteria, that's a given. Even the UFC website has criteria that's 6 years out of date. When almost everyone's uninformed, the majority opinion simply can't mean much. It isn't "most disagree, so most are uninformed", it's "most are uninformed, so their opinion doesn't matter either way". 

&gt;in reality your opinion is just that, an opinion that at its best carries no more weight than anyone else’s.

Sure, if you assign no value to truth and correctness. Not all opinions are created equal.
What criteria are you using ? Colby landed more strikes, more takedowns, moved forward for most of the fight and controlled the pace. I can't imagine what could possibly be more important than all of those things
&gt;What criteria are you using ?

The Unified Rules for 2017. 

http://abcboxing.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2017-Official-MMA-Judging-Criteria.pdf

&gt;Colby landed more strikes

Landing more strikes doesn't matter. If it did, Cruz should've beaten Garbrandt since he landed 95 strikes to Cody's 71. Impact matters in respect to effective striking, and RDA consistently landed cleaner and harder at distance and in the clinch. 

&gt;more takedowns

&gt;It	shall	be	noted	that	a	successful	takedown	is	not	merely	a	changing	of	position,	but	the	
establishment	of	an	attack	from	the	use	of	the	takedown

Nothing Colby did constitutes an attack. He held RDA down off the TD and did nothing else. His takedown is worth as much as any other change of position, such as digging an underhook or grabbing a collar tie. That is, it doesn't constitute effective grappling on it's own. It does count as control, but

&gt;Effective	Striking/Grappling	shall	be	considered	the	first	priority	of	round assessments.	Effective	Aggressiveness	is	a	‘Plan	B’	and	should	not	be	considered	unless	the	judge	does	not	see	ANY	advantage	in	the	Effective	Striking/Grappling	realm.	Cage/Ring	Control	(‘Plan	C’)	should	only	be	needed	when	ALL	other	criteria	are	100%	even	for	both	competitors.	This	will	be	an	extremely	rare	occurrence.

Control doesn't score with any difference in effective work. Therefore, none of Colby's takedowns and control score. 

&gt;moved forward for most of the fight and controlled the pace.

Same thing as control. Cage control only scores if all else is equal, RDA won the striking. Pace control literally isn't even in the criteria. 

&gt;I can't imagine what could possibly be more important than all of those things 

Landing cleaner and harder consistently.
&gt;Sure, if you assign no value to truth and correctness. 

Problem is, you’re the one who believes they get to decide what is the truth and correct when that isn’t the case. You believe RDA won based off *your* interpretation of the criteria, not some unquestionable fact. Colby’s pressure overrode RDAs pressure. Colby implemented his will/game more effectively than RDA did. Colby controlled the octagon more effectively than RDA did. And RDA was on the defensive more than he was the offensive. RDA landed small shots in the clinch, but they didn’t do enough damage to effect Colby or stop him from controlling the fight. It is ridiculous to write off everyone who disagrees with you as uninformed when it’s objectively untrue. Many people who are informed on the criteria believe Colby earned the decision alongside the uninformed who believe that he won too. Just because there are people who haven’t sat down and read the rules who think Colby won doesnt mean everyone who believes that has no idea what they’re talking about or that there’s not a case to be made that corresponds with that criteria. And you saying that their opinion doesn’t matter means fuck all at the end of the day. 

But again, I’m not interested in going around and around because you have no interest in anything but trying to prove yourself objectively right when you can’t. So stick to your guns, keep telling yourself that you’re right and everyone else is wrong, but that won’t change the reality that Colby won the fight officially and in the majorities opinion.
&gt; You believe RDA won based off *your* interpretation of the criteria, not some unquestionable fact.

Sure. Doesn't change that most people don't even know the criteria, so my opinion is still better-founded. 

&gt;Colby’s pressure overrode RDAs pressure

It is unquestionable fact that pressure doesn't matter unless all else is equal per the current criteria. 

&gt;Colby implemented his will more effectively than RDA did

That doesn't score. 

&gt;Colby controlled the octagon more effectively than RDA did

Octagon control doesn't score unless all else is equal. This is also an unquestionable feature of the criteria, and not open to interpretation. 

&gt;RDA landed small shots in the clinch, but they didn’t do enough damage to effect Colby or stop him from controlling the fight

He did more damage than Colby did. Control doesn't score. 

&gt;It is ridiculous to write off everyone who disagrees with you as uninformed when it’s objectively untrue. 

I'm not doing that, this is a strawman. I've already said that I don't believe that people are uninformed because they disagree, I think most people are uninformed regardless. I don't value the majority opinion because it isn't reliable, regardless of whether or not it agrees with me. 

&gt;Many people who are informed on the criteria believe Colby alongside the uninformed who believe that he won.

And I have worthwhile conversations with them. Just citing the media doesn't mean that their opinion has to mean jackshit to me, though, because I don't know if they do know the criteria. 

&gt;So stick to your guns, keep telling yourself that you’re right and everyone else is wrong,

Ok. That is the case. 

&gt;that won’t change the reality that Colby won the fight officially and in the majorities opinion. 

Yeah, RDA got fucked. I know that.
colby beat the fuck out of rda. please dont attempt to change this narrative to that of "rda landed way more punches but clueless ufc judges didnt notice". actually just dont do this.
what is your argument even as to how RDA won the fight? at best he won 2 close rounds while getting murked in 3 rounds. at worst he lost 5 rounds. 

honestly how do you even see this and decide NAH MY BOY RDA WON

did u decide that barboza beat khabib too off of this rule set that only you understand
[deleted]
Your commitment is admirable, but most people on this sub have no idea what they're watching.
RDA won 1/2/4 easily. At worst he lost 3 rounds, because scoring 1 or 4 for Colby is nonsensical when RDA doubled up on his output round 1 and Colby landed nothing really meaningful and he landed the only meaningful shot of round 4. 2 was the swing round, where RDA dug to the body a lot, landed clinch strikes, and landed a clean overhand that stumbled Colby. Colby didn't land as clean nor as hard as RDA throughout the fight, and his cage control doesn't score because it doesn't constitute effective grappling (no potential fight-ending impact, which is how effective grappling is defined), and control only scores if all else is equal (and RDA won the striking). If you can keep from being distracted by Colby's extraneous non-scoring bullshit, RDA won.
&gt; Colby's extraneous non-scoring bullshit

oh ok great description of "beating someone up" i understand now
RDA landed cleaner and harder consistently, Covington had a meaninglessly marginal total strike advantage comprised mostly of flurries intended to facilitate clinch entries that didn't land too well. That was not Covington "beating RDA up". The "non-scoring bullshit" was the cage stalling and nothing takedowns.
I’d like to see Ponz run it back with new and improved Mike Perry
im convinced that this is an elaborate troll and now i feel stupid for responding oops
Nobody seems to agree with you-including me. You’re wrong, buddeh. Youve talked a lot and said a whole lot of nothing. Colby clearly won that fight
&gt;Nobody seems to agree with you-including me

Doesn't matter, I'm still correct. When most people don't know how to judge a fight (i.e. haven't read the criteria), the majority opinion is truly meaningless.

&gt;Youve talked a lot and said a whole lot of nothing

I've used the criteria to back up my position that RDA got screwed. You just haven't made an argument, preferring to act like your opinion is a given.
I agree with you, and I admire your commitment to this cause, mate

Summary:
what is your argument even as to how RDA won the fight?
Colby clearly won that fight.
That was not Covington "beating RDA up".
Colby controlled the octagon more effectively than RDA did.
Cage control only scores if all else is equal, RDA won the striking.
colby beat the fuck out of rda.
He won the striking and Cejudo did nothing with his control, so it doesn't score as effective grappling.
how does a judge score 1 for RDA then 4 for covington???
Control doesn't score with any difference in effective work.
&gt;Colby implemented his will more effectively than RDA did

That doesn't score.
Control itself only scores when all else is equal according to the criteria, which wasn't the case; RDA won the striking.
Yeah I don't like Colby but he 100% won that fight IMO.
The majority of fights don't require the criteria to judge correctly.
Colby landed more strikes, more takedowns, moved forward for most of the fight and controlled the pace.
That fight was very clearly for Johnson.
Doesn't change that most people don't even know the criteria, so my opinion is still better-founded.
The vast majority of people haven't read the criteria, that's a given.
As for the judging, it's not like Colby wall and stalled RDA.
