Yeah... SUCH a selfish jerk for drowning financially because she can’t even afford living expenses... /s
Normally I would agree but  it doesn't even sound like she would be ready to parent if OP made up his mind. An emotionally manipulative, alcoholic, with money issues doesn't make for a great parent.
He is! He's enabling her for his own reasons. If he actually cared about her he would recognize that he doesn't want to give her what he is looking for and let her go! The woman is 38 years old and wants a family. Leading her on is stoping her from being able to ever have what she wants out of life. That is truly selfish and evil.
It doesn't matter. Thats not Op's Decision. He knows he doesn't want children with her so he should break up with her. If someone else wants to have children with her then can make that decision.
Did you miss the part about her being an alcoholic that’s on her third job in 12 months?

A drunk with no job shouldn't get married and have kids, sorry.
No I saw that, but it changes nothing. He is still preventing her from getting what she is looking for in life by holding on to her. He should break up with her, but he doesn't have the moral high ground here.

So you are supporting eugenics now? I'm pretty sure that it is commonly accepted that two consenting adults can have children if they want to.
I am going to have to agree with you. Her flaws aren’t the issue to me. She has been clear about what she wants and as a woman I understand that she only has a certain number of child bearing years. He needs to shit or get off the pot.
If that's what you call eugenics then sure. Maybe having kids should be a privilege not a right if you're incapable of caring for them.
It absolutely changes things and he absolutely does have the high ground when he's 8 years younger and literally supporting her entire life while she gets to abuse alcohol. She shouldn't even be considering kids until she can stay sober.
How is that eugenics lol
eu·gen·ics
yo͞oˈjeniks
noun
the science of improving a human population by controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics. Developed largely by Francis Galton as a method of improving the human race, it fell into disfavor only after the perversion of its doctrines by the Nazis.

I don’t think you have a proper grasp of what eugenics is. It’s definitely not saying some shouldn’t have children in a situation where they can barely take care of themselves. This couple isn’t in a place to have children, and she wouldn’t be able to care for children on her own. Eugenics would be “she shouldn’t have children because she is only 4’8’’ and we hate short people.”

"Selfish and evil"? Stop with that nonsense. 

Seems like you're really bringing a lot of personal baggage to this discussion. Maybe time to take a deep breath and step away from the keyboard for a while.
Woah you feel VERY strongly about this situation... even if she was fit to be a mother at this point in her life, she could also leave him and find someone who wants a kid with her. It sounds like he hasn’t been leading her on... But instead it sounds like she needs to use him for a place to live and money. 

Regardless, reading your comments you need to calm you tiddies
Then why is he even with her?
