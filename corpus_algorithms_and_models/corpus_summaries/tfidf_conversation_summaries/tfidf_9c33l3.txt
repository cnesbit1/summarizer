Original Response:
In 2017 Luis Videgaray, the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, warned Canada many times not to abandon Mexico for bilateral negotiations. Canada assured Mexico many times that it would not and insisted in only trilateral negotiations. We all know how that ended - Mexico didn't have the cajones to stand up to Trump and caved in. Mexico needs to pay a price for its treachery.
Let's also remember that the outgoing regime is thoroughly corrupt. Money, murder and mayhem are what characterizes them best.

They were always going to lie, cheat and steal, when it suited them, while pretending good-faith. 

But good-faith is a Canadian characteristic, so it was reasonable for Canada to expect reciprocity from Mexico... right up until the moment that they bent under US pressure. Now we know that the moment has passed, and that, in this deal, Canada must deal only on a bilateral basis with the US.

It will be interesting to see how relations are portrayed with the new Mexican government.... and what concessions to Canada on other files they are willing to make in order to re-set relations.

no
Reinstate the visa requirements for Mexico lol

This would be incredibly petty, we should do it.
Nah man the real petty thing is to keep the visa exemption in so that they can fly here and then jump the border into the US.

fuck Trump first then work from that.
How many Mexicans have you seen in Canada?
We shouldn't have a trade deal with Mexico in the first place.
It should never have been lifted.
The best thing Trudeau could do for Canada is to resign immediately.
atleast we can all find solace in the fact that he's a better leader than sheer
No it's not.  Just cause you conservatives only bow to weak leadership I didn't vote for the guy but if he sticks to his guns I'll vote for him next election.  Where the hell is a Brian Mulroney or Peter Lougheed when we need them.
The online trolls have gotten a little lazy...

no I'm just not a fucking brainlet.

'we gotta punish mexico bro i'm all outta chicken tendies'

'yeah lets punish them!!! yeah wow it sounds so cool to sound big and strong.'

we're not going to do anything, it would be stupid to do anything, fuck off with the autistic Canadian jingoism.

Look at the levels of trade between the parties to NAFTA.  Trade between Canada and mexico is basically negligible compared to trade with the US.  

It's obvious that it isn't in Mexico's best interest to fall on their own sword for Canada.  It's not that they didn't have the cajones, its that they actually care about their own people over yelling "ORANGE MAN BAD".
In the private sector when one of your negotiators is more of a liability than an asset, you switch up the staff. I'd take anyone slightly right of Trudeau as a pinch hitter right now

The current Pena Nieto Administration of the PRI is center-right and leaves power in December for a left-wing Obrador Administration. Pena Nieto knew that he needed to sign any deal by December or Obrador would effectively kill negotiations and Mexico would leave NAFTA.

&amp;#x200B;

So the decision for Pena Nieto was (1) a bad deal but better than the end of NAFTA OR (2) the end of NAFTA. He chose the former.

He literally has Mulroney and other CPC members on the team.
An absolute ton when I worked at the airport

We had removals every day
Mexico could have negotiated a better deal if they worked with Canada but that's beside the point. They asked Canada to stick together as a team, then went their own way leaving Canada out of the negotiations and even negotiated some trilateral issues. Had Canada simply started negotiations looking out for it's own interests, we would have done better.
Harper would have had a deal by now.        
Bye Bye Dairy....Hello Yemem
Question...why do you stay if you hate and disrespect Canada so much.     
If you think Mexico is so 'stand up'...why not move there ?
It's not the private sector, they're duly elected officials negotiating with a literally demented bad faith counterpart. The people, through the democracy, want JT to represent them. That's how it's going to be.
We need the cheap mexican labour. Trudeau would effectively kill the liberal party if he did that.
For better or worse. We elected TD in an era where Donald Trump as president was a meme at best
Come to BC in the summer
Thank goodness he’s not an idiot. I’m personally not a fan of Trudeau, but you can’t argue with the team he’s assembled and the stance he’s taken. Better to wait it out at least until the November midterms, see if Trump get impeached and/or indicted by Mueller.
Unfortunately so. But I'm not convinced that JT is all that horrible. /r/canada is significantly more depressive and negative than the reality, it's almost like people come here to vent and contribute nothing else.

They are all corrupt in MX. I don't think its possible to even form a government there without ties to organised crime. You would be killed.

In terms of the new government, they apparently fully support this new US/Mexico agreement. And the vibe I am getting from Mexico is they are going to be no friend to Canada.
[deleted]
Agreed.
Petty and stupid.  Nothing like getting the Americans to beef up security on their northern border and make it harder for Canadians to cross, while simultaneously ensuring a complete lack of cooperation from them regarding illegal hoppers going north.
Of course he would say that, he was worried about Mexico.

Give me a weak smart leader than a hard headed dumb one. Flexing your muscles only works if you lead a powerhouse, in which Canada is not.
Yes, but that would actually require diversity of work experience while the diversity movement is clearly focused on diversity of immutable characteristics like sex and skin colour.
And the wall
&gt; “Petty and stupid” has pretty accurately described Trump/Ford

Fixed
So when is the US dropping that moron, Trump?
If only we had Harper sucking Trump’s dick

Hate to say it, he's going 2 terms
Nope

Well the CPC have weak in spades, too bad they missed the bus on smart.
What wall? Along the Canadian border?
There's really not that many... Most of our foreign workforce is Filipino

That's a bit more of a generalization than is useful.

The new government is unusual because it's composed of leftist labor activists who won  an anti-corruption campaign against already corrupted officials in the pay of wealthy landowners, industrialists and organized crime.

They loath the American record of Mexican labor exploitation and racism, and in particular Trump and all he represents. Canada, on the other hand, aligns with their socially progressive ideals.

I fully expect gestures of appeasement from the new government once elected... and once their deal with the US is locked down. 

I don't think there is any further utility in NAFTA, however. It is based on notions of goodwill and common objectives that were only ever conceptual, and that were never lived-up to. Mexico serves no strategic purpose for Canada, other than as negotiating partner to help alleviate American negotiating over-reach, a position they have now demonstrated they will not fill. 

With a MAGA mindset, where Trumpians have taken on the role of being victims of  Canadian and Mexican exploitation, presumably because we collectively pulled the wool over the eyes of the poor-ole aw-shucks Reagan negotiating team, NAFTA no longer serves any purpose at all.

Well, we still have the auto-pact, FTA and the WTO, and Trump will be gone in 6 years, so new opportunities will arise, albeit being diluted by the malignancy of MAGA, which will linger for a while.

American Money and workers will fight to maintain business ties with Canada, whatever Trumpians may say, so, like the rest of the world, we just need to wait it out, and let Americans fix America.

&gt;&gt; That's a bit more of a generalization than is useful.

I agree with everything you've posted except this. Sadly, it's shockingly accurate.

I'd just add that EPN is shocked to realize he now has a "legacy" and is trying to forge one in the last month of his six-year presidency. Incoming AMLO is a complete wildcard and we've no idea what that will mean for policy.

It has nothing at all to do with the trade *between* Canada and Mexico, it was to be the combined Exports/Imports of Mexico and Canada **to the US** that gave them a stronger negotiating position at the table.

Mexico doesn't give a shit about anyone / anything else other than themselves.
We don't have cheap Mexican labor. Most of our TFW / immigrants come East Asia anyway. We need to stand up for ourselves.
We got the short end of the NAFTA stick yet everybody is acting like we're the ones benefiting the most from it. Mexico got all the jobs and the US price of living went down drastically while we got neither. Everything is still expensive in Canada, Americans can afford to live more lavishly and we lost more jobs to Mexico than we've gained from NAFTA. What a joke.
Mexico is considered the second most dangerous country on Earth, and this during peacetime. Guess who's first? Syria, which is in a full blown civil war. So if Syria wasn't in a civil war, Mexico would be considered the most dangerous country on Earth. The fact that anybody would consider the idea of the Mexican government being at the mercy of drug cartels a "generalization" is astounding. Mexican politicians get assassinated left and right if they dare speak up against the cartels. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having good-faith with such a country with a truly colossal mistake. One that made us look like fools and the naive idealists of the world.

Really? Who works the farms? Sure isnt East Asians.
TIL that 270% tariffs are considered good faith.
Winter is the natural visa requirement.
The US is already doing that. They also want complete control of Canadian immigration, while doing nothing to stop American residents crossing the border to Canada. Let them build the "Wall in the North", we know how that will go.

I see a lot of wealthy-looking Latin American tourists in Vancouver, most of which must be from Mexico. I think the visa lift must have been a net positive for touristy areas.
The incoming regime is just a corrupt, and they are the ones who pushed for the bilateral round of negotiations.
By signing the agreement, they just screwed over their own citizens. They just paid the price. I would be very pissed right now if I was Mexican.
Im not agreeing or disagreeing if we need them but it 100% happens now. ~42000 a season. Downvotes dont change reality. Im guessing you live in an urban area and dont know this.

Dont live near Delhi or Leamington do you?

I'm sure you don't have to imagine anything since stupid is your reality.
Just as one example, in 2012 the previous government used a parallel funding scheme for vote buying.  
[In 2018, the incoming government did pretty much the same.](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-44884993)
  
In the coming years you'll be hearing a lot about corruption scandals from the new MX government.
When rivals are cheating, the only way to beat them is to cheat better.

So lets examine the nature of the cheating:

The incumbent government stole state money to finance their campaign

Another opponent took money illegally from special interests to finance their campaign

The new government, it is implied (but not proven), redirected money collected illegally for another purpose, to finance their campaign.

If election financing irregularities are normative, and AMLO used the latter method to beat their opponents who were using the other other methods, then, to my mind AMLO is still more virtuous.
Excellent, now please "rationalize" why his party is packed with the worst politicians from the old regime, for example [the guy who ordered the torture and assasination of a DEA agent](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sinembargo.mx%2F07-07-2015%2F1405899&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url) who was appointed by AMLO as CEO of the national electricity company. Or the guy [who embezzled from a mining union, bought a Canadian citizenship and now is an unelected senator](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.animalpolitico.com%2F2018%2F08%2Fnapoleon-gomez-urrutia-reaparece-mexico-senado%2F&amp;edit-text=). 
  
What about AMLO's chief of staff, [a guy who laudered money for Augusto Pinochet](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.laizquierdadiario.mx%2FQuien-es-Alfonso-Romo-Garza-ex-socio-financiero-de-Pinochet-y-Salinas-de-Gortari)?  
  
Please tell me how all this reeks of virtue.

The ignorance is staggering, the AMLO administration took part in the negotiations.
Stfu go back to erremierdico
All of that impeachment talk just ensures that Trump's supporters show up at the polls to vote. Dems need a better strategy.  They need a better strategy and workable agenda than just "Fuck Trump." Lol
The US economy is so hot right now. Barring an economic recession or depression, I think Trump is getting a second term.
No

Summary:
The US is already doing that.
That's how it's going to be.
We need to stand up for ourselves.

Mexico needs to pay a price for its treachery.
They are all corrupt in MX.
