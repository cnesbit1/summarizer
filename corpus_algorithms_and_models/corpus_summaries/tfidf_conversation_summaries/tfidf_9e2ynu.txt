Should we take our Bitcoin off exchanges? So they can't be used against us?
Yes I dont understand keeping large sums of coin on an exchange anyway unless you're an active trader. You're essentially trusting the exchange not to get hacked.
The 'live in a concrete bunker surrounded by guns, water, and stocks of beans' crowd worry about this.

It isn't a big worry IMO, unless you hold a large quantity.

I kept a 5 figure sum on an exchange for months, and all was fine.  But it has now been moved somewhere safer.

Also, if you control the keys (i.e. they are in your personal wallet, not theirs), you get any airdrops due to you.  If you leave coins on an exchange then it is up to them when to release them to you - if ever.
I'm just thinking more along the lines. If the exchange is using them against us for personal gain! I did enjoy the NXT airdrop beginning of the year. Half my coins are in my personal wallets so only half the risk and reward too!
I do spend a lot of time trading. But I do see it has a risk.
Well.  They are a business, they will gain as much as they can :)
Greed can be predictable lol never owned Bitcoin cash so must be doing something right!
Word
The wonder of exchanges is that they are impossible to audit (or let's say, they aren't audited). Doesn't really matter if they truly hold the money or the BTC if they have high-confidence strategies for increasing them, they can just change a few numbers in their databases.
You're making it seem like the probability of something bad happening to an exchange is absolutely minimal and not worth thinking about, and that's just not true. We have countless examples, from MtGox which partially caused the 2014-15 crypto winter, our Polish Bitcurex, to recent Bitgrail from which Nano still can't pick up itself. And various minor hacks which were small enough not to kill an exchange. Not to mention exchanges locking up people's funds because of KYC and stuff... Yes, most of the time nothing happens, but it happens often enough that if you're in this market for a few years, the probabilty that something like this will happen to you is trending towards 1.
trending towards 1?  A certainty?

Get in that bunker with your beans and guns mate.

Silly
Well, for me it's already 1 because I had some pretty large (in today's prices) sum on Bitcurex. My friend had a truckload of Nano bought for pennies and he kept it all on Bitgrail. I'm pretty sure if we did a poll of how many people who were in crypto since 2013 have lost anything anywhere at some point, it would be a double digit percentage.

Summary:
If the exchange is using them against us for personal gain!
