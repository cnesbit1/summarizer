Original Response:
Why make Plague Doctor stats so hard to obtain? Why have items that are stat selectable without specification that don't include the stat? Why can't I run fractals, the only content in the game that requires ascended, in Plague Doctor gear without doing raids? 

I assumed when this exact same situation happened in Season 3 it was just incompetence but now i'm wondering if they are just trying to force more players into raiding.
Why don’t you work for it?
Work for what?
For gear with plague doctor stats
Well I have worked for the trinket, ring, and ammy you can buy from the vendor. I don't raid so I have no way of getting an additional ring and trinket since they are unique.

I have worked a lot in fractals and gathering materials and attempted to craft armor from grandmaster marks which don't state any stat restriction but Plague Doctors isn't an option.
Then you need to work harder then
Nah i'll just play a better game.
Okay then send me your mats
Nah I don't think someone that thinks you should have to raid to get a stat set to do the content that is supposed to a stepping stone to raids would spend it very wisely but if you need some more mats let me pass along some sage advice I just got: Work harder.
You’re saying you don’t want to play the game so I figured you wouldn’t mind parting with your materials. And why are you limiting yourself? if you really want something don’t set up and arbitrary barriers for yourself push for what you want.
Don't feed him! =X
actually the trinket at least is not unique. Though i assume that's just an oversight, so you might get burned in a future patch if you buy two and the devs later notice and correct that.
Sure you are buddy. If you were you wouldn't bother even posting.
