Original Response:
I read somewhere that whatever milk is left in the breast after weaning gets absorbed back into the body. But what exactly is happening there? How is the body able to absorb nutrients without involving the digestive tract?

I hope these are not extraordinarily dumb questions. I only have middle school level background in biology (and most other things).

I didn't know this! Very interesting. I also can't stand blood products, so I am not sure how to feel about dairy now, heh.

So cheese is a rotting scab?
Is cow milk the same? You’re telling me I pour cow blood into my coffee every morning.
It’s not made OF blood. Your blood carries around proteins, fats, sugars, etc that you got from your food. Those parts are taken back out of your blood, and made into milk.  

If the milk doesn’t get expressed, it eventually gets broken down into pieces again and taken away.  (I would imagine that it’s similar to the way that “unused” sperm are broken down and taken away.)

No. I'm telling you that you could be pouring cow blood into your coffee every morning.

im not sure its the same as unused sperm. sperm will die because of lack of androgens (male sex hormone) while breast tissue will die due to a decrease in stimulating hormones (oxytocin). 

also, there is a thing called the "blood testis barrier" that stops communication between the body of the male and anything inside the reproductive track in the testis. that barrier is very strong. removal of dead sperm is much more difficult than removal of normal dead cells

Gonna have some coffee with that cow blood, buddy?
The cells in the breast that produce milk are going to either commit suicide (this is called apoptosis and is completely normal) or the connections between those cells and neighboring cells are removed and the cells die of starvation. Other cells come in and destroy the junk that’s left behind and will get rid of most of the harmful stuff left behind. The clean up cells and the remaining cells will most likely take up and use the nutrients left behind. The destroyed cells are replaced with fat cells. 

Breast milk contains protein, fat, and carbs. ~~All of these things can be pushed into the blood stream and easily degraded by the liver or just released in the urine.~~ 

Edit: a lot of the time, any milk left over after weaning will leak out of the breast. unless the ducts in the breast that carry milk to the nipple are blocked, there will be discharge. release of milk is caused by a few mechanisms and it takes a while (up to months) to destroy the majority of milk producing cells. 

Edit 2: those clean up cells will do all the work (macrophages), VERY little of those proteins, fats, or carbs will enter the blood.
Thanks for all this info! I stopped breastfeeding a few months ago, and still produce small amounts of milk (enough to get a few drops from hand expressing). Nice to know more about what's actually going on there.
So wait, our cells, pieces of a whole, commit suicide when they find themselves unnecessary, but we humans (parts of a whole as well) can't do the same thing? What's that all about?!

Was there any other way to read this than in a Bill Nye voice?
It's a cultural thing.

The inuits, for example, were known to practice exactly that. Get too old to be useful, and just walk off into the snow to die. Among other, more violent ways of elder suicide/murder.

Humans have developed this weird idea that \~ \~human\~ \~ all life is sacred and nothing should ever end in an unnatural way. Despite this, a fair percentage of our society takes life legally and illegally quite often.

Right, and honestly, if we really look at nature, we'd realize that things shouldn't live forever and that resistance keeps us from fully embracing life.
Technically speaking, the body doesn't belong to you but a host of cells that choose to work together for mutual benefits. You just make the decisions for them like a company president.
I produced teeny bits of milk up until almost three years after the fact and only stopped when I entered the second trimester of my second pregnancy.
Good freaking point! Well as CEO of this thing, I should be able to close up shop and take my employees *cough* cells on a company retreat!
Technically, you can. The cells don't actually stop you, although they try to keep the company running as best as they could. Not sure if that's why you cry though. In fact when you are feeling suicidal, the body almost always come with a strong desire to reproduce, in an attempt to pass the genes down to the next person. 

Not all genes make it to the end, but there is some sort of common agreement where every gene is given a fair shot down the transport train. Unfortunately also, this desire to reproduce as you are suicidal comes off as desperate in modern context. There's a lot of things we misunderstand about the human body actually =)

Cells apoptize when they are no longer useful **to the whole system**, I'm not sure that's a standard of enforced suicide many redditors would be comfortable with
Right lol but, if we reserve the title of useless for people who define themselves as such, and maybe require there to be illness or disease present before consideration, it could work well. Allowing people to choose I think it's important. There's nothing more freeing than knowing you can leave whenever you want.
Hormone changes in pregnancy specifically block the release of milk while at the same time increasing milk production. The interaction between all of these hormones are crazy. some hormones that have nothing to do with breast/milk development act to increase mammary development just because there is so much of them circulating in the blood stream. (these hormones do have a similar structure but do not assist in breast/milk development when hormones levels are "normal"/non-pregnant)

technically, breast feeding can work as contraceptive. but a woman would need to breast feed about 10+ times per day for extended period of time each time. super hard to pull off
apoptosis/programed cell death/cell suicide is SUPER important. its how cells make sure they dont turn into cancer. 

remember that cells are not continuous. they are no smarter than computers. a cell carries out its function in the body and nothing else (normally).
cells talk to each other A LOT. they share nutrients and ask for help. 

"we" do not decide how or what our cells do (at a cell by cell level). our actions change the environment around the our cells and the cells responds. this is called homeostasis
Also supposedly you don't get your period. Except I did. I was exclusively breastfeeding and got my period back at the 7 week mark. I thought maybe I was just having some more post partum bleeding but I bled again exactly 28 days later so I figured it was a real period.
