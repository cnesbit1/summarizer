Not sure if you still looking for redeems but I can do them, saves managed with JKSM/checkpoint and RNG w/ pCalc &amp;CFW
Sure can you do Zygarde redeems? What were you looking for?
Yes, algo KG/TT. Can you get LL Codes? That's what I want, but I would prefer if we did a rate of 2:1 with half of codes I receive being KG instead of reservations. How many redeems are you looking for BTW?
I don't know about Lati@s codes just because it'd be dependent on how best buy decides to distribute and if they're going to be cool about it. I'd be looking for like 6-10 redeems. Can you do just nature redeems to? Without rng? I'd be looking for like a mix.
Well, I could do 5 mix RNG Redeems for 10 codes. I'm don't want to do just nature redeem
Would you do like 2 RNG and 3 just nature?
Maybe, depending on what codes you want redemeed
The 2 would be KG and the 3 would be Zygarde
I will have to check my saves at home first. I don't remember if I have 3 saves free for Zygarde, I know I have one but not sure about 3
Kk lemme know if you have any (:
Just as I tought, only 1 save for Zygardes. Would you do 5 codes for the nature Zygarde + KG RNG?
So how many redeems would you do?
2 RNG + 1 Zygarde nature (or RNG, whatever)
Yea I can do that (: I'll give you the details tonight (:
Hey can I get three more shiny Z redeems for RNG? Or you can't get redeems at all? (just wanted to make sure it wasn't just for stock redeems)
Well, I can do 3 S-Zygarde RNG, but in that case I would ask for at least 2 Latis reservations.
Hm. I'll stick with the five for now then contact you if I get a good amount of codes from best buy?
That's ok
Awesome. So 5 KG Codes for 3 redeems?
Yes, RNG or nature for Zygarde?
Nature for Zygarde and RNG for KG. I'll send codes and stats tonight (:
Do you do languages? Also what language is the redeem you have available for the Zygarde?
Only EnG available
Kk. I'll take Zygarde with Adamant nature.

* All with 31 IVs in specified stats unless not possible.

* Kyogre - Adamant| 5IV | HP, Attack, Defense, Special Defense and Speed

* Groudon - Mild | 5IV | HP, Attack, Special Attack, Special Defense and Speed

These will come with redeem proof correct? I'll send codes soon. Both redemption and trade.
Hey Imma out a hold on this trade for now.

Summary:
Nature for Zygarde and RNG for KG.
Sure can you do Zygarde redeems?
Would you do 5 codes for the nature Zygarde + KG RNG?
Yes, RNG or nature for Zygarde?
Can you do just nature redeems to?
