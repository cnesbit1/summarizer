Original Response:
Here I am sitting with a bag full of avocados, and all of them are not quite ripe yet. I wonder if the fat and nutritional content are the same at this stage as when it ripens or if there is a type of transformation that happens as it ripens. If, so, why?

The sugar content doesn't rise as the banana ripens. What happens is that the complex chain of sugars (known as a starch) begins to break down. This causes more simple sugars to be more readily available and makes the banana sweeter.
[removed]
That's incorrect. Starch is not counted as sugar, so when starch gets converted to sugar, sugar content does indeed rise.
What do you mean starches aren't  counted as sugar? 
Starch is a polysaccharide. Polysaccharides are chains of sugars.

Yes, starches is made of monosaccharides, but that doesn't mean they're sugars.

Look up sugars on Wikipedia. The definition of a sugar is that it's a short carbohydrate (ie made from monosaccharides) AND tastes sweet. Starch doesn't taste sweet. Neither does cellulose, which also is a polysaccharide, but humans can't digest them at all.

So yes, as a banana ripens the sugar content rises as starch is converted into sugars.
Neither you nor he are factually inaccurate.  Starches are not sugars even though they are entirely made of them.  Animals are made entirely of elemental compounds, yet they are not classified as such.

/u/yugo_1 is wrong because nobody before your reply commented that starches are counted as sugars.  While you are wrong because your question implies that they are.  Even the link you posted is careful to talk about sugars, before talking about polysaccharides.  They are associated but not the same.
Right, okay I see what you're saying. From a nutritional standpoint though, the sugars are still in the banana - they're just in starch form
Not really. The saccharides are in the banana. But saccharides != sugar. Saccharides are the building block for sugars and other carbohydrates. Sure, when they're 'alone' as a monosaccharide they're classified as sugars but that's not the case here.
Not really, because they're starch and not sugar....

Perhaps we could use another polysaccharide to comapre: cellulose

Would you talk about the sugar content of a cellulose dish sponge?
[removed]
So we would say that the amount of carbs don't change, but it changes from starch to sugar?
&gt; While you are wrong because your question implies that [starches are sugar]

I don't really think the quote below only implies that starches are sugar:

&gt; The sugar content doesn't rise as the banana ripens. What happens is that the complex **chain of sugars (known as a starch)** begins to break down.
So does the nutritional information adjust accordingly?
[removed]
Incorrect. Sugars are short (one or two glucose/fructose links), solvable in water and taste sweet. Starches are none of those.

Starches are carbohydrates, but not sugars.

Your phrasing is confusing and I don't understand if you are trying to agree or disagree with me.
[removed]
I'm sorry for lack of clarity.

I was trying to say that your characterization doesn't seem accurate.

You told Scbios that they were wrong, because they implied that starches are sugars - I was trying to point out that, at least to me, they did more than just imply it; they specifically said so.

And in that light it doesn't seem strange that yugo_1 would comment on it.

Perhaps I am misunderstanding something.
It depends on what you mean by "amount" and "carbs" üòâ

By weight the amount of carbohydrates doesn't change significantly. But the amount of carbohydrate substances increase, since the chemical meaning of the word amount is the number of molecules in this example. And since the starch is long chains of monosaccharides that gets divided into several shorter sugars, the amount increases.

And the use of "carbs" is a bit ambiguous... It's originally a short form of carbohydrates, but is often used as an everyday term for energy content, since carbohydrates are our main source of energy. The amount, by weight, of carbohydrates doesn't change as the longer carbohydrates break down to shorter ones. But if a form of carbohydrate that the human digestive system normally can't digest, for example cellulose, were to be broken down into starch or sugars, which our bodies can make use of, the amount of usable energy could increase.

I don't really know if the latter happens, but it is theoretically possible.
&gt; The sugar content doesn't rise as the banana ripens.

You're right and wrong, but mostly wrong. Obviously sugar molecules don't appear out of nowhere, but polysaccharides are not sugar any more than trees are firewood. Yes, you can chop up starch to get sugar (or chop up a tree to get firewood), but that doesn't mean that starch is a kind of sugar.
[removed]
&gt; Starch is a polysaccharide. Polysaccharides are chains of sugars.

Being a chain of sugars and being a sugar are not the same thing. A line of cars is not a car. A forest is not a tree. A beach is not a grain of sand.
This part does:

&gt; The sugar content doesn't rise as the banana ripens.

And it's factually incorrect. The sugar content *does* rise as the banana ripens, because starch is not sugar and as the banana ripens it gets turned into sugar. Meaning there's more sugar in a ripe banana than an unripe one, meaning the sugar content has increased.
The nutritional information for an unripe banana and a ripe banana would be different, yes. The total energy content would be similar, but the breakdown would be different.
[deleted]
No need to be sorry, I make perfect sense in my own head but it doesn't always come out that way.  ; )  Thanks for actually clarifying!

There is nothing factually inaccurate about it though and they aren't saying that starches *are* sugars so much as the sugars within them haven't become *not sugar*.  If I place an iron chain in a bucket of water, seal it, and wait for it to rust away, has the iron content of the bucket changed?  I'd say that no it has not changed.  The amount in solution has changed, but the total amount of iron within the bucket has stayed relatively flat (of course that isn't 100% accurate, but it's close enough for all practical purposes).

In the end it is kind of a Ship of Theseus type of situation I suppose, or it's equally possible I'm misunderstanding something instead.
&gt; both ripe and unripe would have the same amount of total carbs

Not exactly the same. The "chopping up" process involves a bit of energy. But close enough.
[deleted]
So an unripe banana would be better for you because it would provide a slow release of sugar.
[removed]
Not exactly.  The type of starch is a resistant starch, which would act more as insoluble fiber than a complex carbohydrate, in that it would effectively just pass through the gut undigested.
Sugar can be (and probably was, by the OP) used as a synonym for saccharide - which even comes from the Greek word œÉŒ¨Œ∫œáŒ±œÅŒøŒΩ (s√°kkharon), meaning "sugar".

If you ate it you would. This is a silly analogy, you don't eat dish sponges so the nutritional content doesn't matter.
Agreed. Calling starch "sugar" when discussing the different nutrients in a banana is going to confuse a layman. The point is you will get a higher glycemic response from eating a very ripe banana. Overall, though, unless you have an issue with diabetes, I don't see a huge difference from eating a slightly green banana and a yellow one. Just eat whichever you feel tastes better. If the tastiness of a ripe banana convinces you to eat one every day, that's a good thing. It has lot of potassium, some vitamins, and fiber, and it's much better for you compared to purple drink.
