Honda 600rr for sale. 

Slight damage from a small drop, decided I don’t want to ride anymore.  Still is great shape though!
How much? Would make a great first bike for my niece, she's only 3.
I’ll give you a great deal, it’s a 2006, I’ll sell it for 8000
Idk, that seems steep, what about 500? Think of the kid, she would love it.
Deal, but I’m keeping the custom slip on and mint helmet
Oh good, her parents will be so excited. I hope she can reach the controls though.
The handle bars have been professionally lowered so that may help some. The tank was also lowered.. professionally.
