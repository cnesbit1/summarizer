How to spoil a kpop fangirl's day. Tell her you want to send her a pic of g dragon.

She'll be expecting something like [this](https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/landscape/public/images/methode/2018/01/18/482a92dc-fc0b-11e7-b2f7-03450b80c791_1280x720_135443.jpg?itok=tXZBSZ0u), but no. Send his [candid pics without makeup](https://koreaboo-cdn.storage.googleapis.com/2017/10/GDragon-Beard-01.jpg).

Amazing what makeup can do for guys too, not just girls.
His "candid" pics look better leh
wat.. he looks like a random extra in a JAV
“Hi Kpop girl can I send you a pic of g-dragon?”

“Uhhh ok” (what the hell? this guy is so weird)

“Here you go” *sends pic of g-dragon with no makeup*

“Uhh thanks I guess” (Jesus I hope he never talks to me again)
I'm sorry if that's how your interactions with friends go 😥
“Hi Kpop girl can I send you a pic of g-dragon”

“Woohoo I can’t wait! Please send it right away!”

“Here you go” *sends a pic of g-dragon with no make up*

“Ugh! No you spoilt my day! Hehe!”
Both ugly
Bruh, I don't even like g-dragon but his comment is accurate af in describing how you'd come off as some socially awkward neckbeard if you talked like that to a girl.
Lmao 🤣🤣
Ohhhh. Emmm. Geeeee.

"Bruh", you're stupid if you think I talked to any of my friends in the manner he posted.

I wrote a condensed version of what I did, not verbatim. 

End result was just people being surprised by how k pop idols look without make up, nothing awkward.

I think people on this subreddit project too much when it comes to social awkwardness based on their own inadequacies.
I'm sorry if that's how your interactions with friends go 😥

But that's not how any of my whatsapps with my friends happened.
&gt; if you think I talked to any of my friends in the manner he posted.

Good thing I don't actually think that, but the fact that you're even fantasising and joking about it says a lot. 

Nah, you come off as a loser who doesn't know how to speak to women without scaring them off. That's a sad fact man. Now bye loser
