It must be weird right now because the power is a shifting to those who want to do their job but have been prevented from doing it. I'm assuming the leadership is still pretty much controlled but the climate makes it difficult for bad actor to remain discreet. People must be outing themselves left and right. I am specifically speaking of the part of law enforcement that collaborates to hide crimes rather than police them.
The mainstream media selectively edits video of police encounters:

I would say cops do precisely what cops are created to do. Look into the origin of cops and it's all about protecting industry and private property, not the public.
Park rangers of various hills in California in the early 1900’s from what I recollect.    And they would usually have gruesome tales of murdering young black and Latino wandering in the hills.       Say laurel canyon ,  I believe those rangers kept the browns out unless they were popular musicians. Ect.
This guy gets it, the whole for the public thing way basically a propaganda campaign to gain the trust of the public people to let them do what they do
the MSM (as in TV channels and News outlets) is a marketing tool, nothing more nothing less.

there are a few exceptions, but most of it is there to sell something.
I wasn't even aware of that one. I was thinking of them shooting up unions and keeping slaves in line.
its alright anyone with those professions are pathetic and get whats coming to them in the end. some of us make mistakes. some of us make shittier mistakes. what can you do.
Working for the law abiding citizens ha ha lol that's a good one law abiding or criminal they look at you in the same way all you are to them is $$$.
The majority of people feel the same sense of paranoia walking out of a store without having bought anything.
My man
While it's a complex problem, the most expeditious solution would be to legalize both all drugs and prostitution. These are the two big areas in which the police mandate is to go after people for consensual activity, and ubiquitous consensual activity at that.
I find it bizarre that many cops hide out to catch people “driving recklessly” when they could be preventing actual crimes, or actually helping people.  

Cops don’t work for us, they work for the state.  Once you understand  that, it makes much more sense.
That's because I don't want a speeding ticket for going 5 over on the interstate.
That’s where people are wrong. The Supreme Court has ruled that duty of police is NOT to protect a citizen
People driving recklessly ***is*** a crime.
They work for the corporation that pays them. Unfortunately you are misled to believe they are there for you. They are there to serve and protect the crown or corporation they work for.

Also one which kills many people every year.
What bothers me the most is that they can pull you over for any reason they want and just fabricate a reason. Me and my step dad would get pulled over coming home from work and because we worked night shift that would have us getting home around 2:15am with our commute. That would be prime time for drunk drivers getting out of the bars since California has a 2:00am cut-off time. “Sir it looks like you were having a hard time staying in your lane”. Me and my step dad just looked at each other and laughed and he told the cop, “yeah after you blinded me with your lights I did”. They let us go when they realized we were squeaky clean and there was no money to be made off of us.
I think the cops have forgot this as well
This isn’t crooked by any means. It might not seem like much to you, but lane violations are a behavior common in drunk drivers. It may have been an inconvenience for you but the next stop he made may have actually been a drunk and he may have saved a life for stopping that individual because of a minor lane violation.
To protect and serve- political interest
Politics: *The art of convincing the majority that they somehow benefit from enriching a minority at their own expense.*
I honestly believe that part of the shift toward political acceptance of drugs is because now is it just as easy to plant CP on the computer of a political opponent, so you don't need to keep drugs illegal and plant drugs on them anymore. Also, the CIA doesn't need to run drugs for cash anymore because they are have more mainstream funding with the same level of non-accountability.
Just because the cop says, "you're swerving in your lane," doesn't actually mean OP or his dad actually *were*.  There's no proof either way, and in a court of law, the cop's word is typically taken as more truthful than the word of the accused.  What he's saying is that cops can make any excuse or reason to pull you over that they want, and can find a way to justify it, regardless of how unnecessary or illegal the stop even is in the first place.
Cops have always worked against law-abiding citizens, as designed.  They are nothing more than the enforcement arm of a corrupt fascist state, always have been.
Except the police state gets to define what "reckless driving" is...In Virginia, driving 80 MPH is *automatically* considered reckless driving.
POLICy Enforcement.
I got downvoted pretty hard on that one. That’s the point of dash cams nowadays. But I see your point, if an officer fails to capture the violation on camera, then it does become the officer’s word vs. the defendant, and in the eyes of the court, typically the officer’s word has more validity.

This is a problem if that’s the case and these individuals need to be removed from their duties if they are illegally stopping cars. 

Now if there was actually a violation, giving the officer a hard time for that stop is unfair in my opinion. That was the point I was initially trying to get across.
Absolutely it’s unfair to give an officer a hard time for a legitimate stop.  However, there’s just too much abue of he system going on these days, and thanks to the *Thin Blue Line*&amp;trade;, the bad cops are never outed.
No, it seems to be because of a grassroots movement. Check out groups such as Drug Policy Alliance, Marijuana Majority, and Students For Sensible Drug Policy. Also, the internet is allowing people to communicate more about this stuff. The big powers that be are desperate to continue to squelch psychedelics specifically. Whenever I get into deep psychedelic topics on reddit, I'm met with hard-core trolling, like extremely blatant lying.

Summary:
some of us make mistakes.
I think the cops have forgot this as well.
Cops don’t work for us, they work for the state.
That’s where people are wrong.
