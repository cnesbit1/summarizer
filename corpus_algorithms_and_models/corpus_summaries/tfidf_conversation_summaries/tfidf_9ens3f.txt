Today is a work day for me so I will be responding throughout the day starting at 8amPST/11am EST. I will be replying through the day.

**Edit** 1230EST I am slowly pecking away at responses throughout the day, between patients and work.  Please be patient!  I'll focus on the most upvoted for now but I will look for unique questions as well!

**Edit** 1400EST 838 new messages in my inbox - it's unrealistic at my pace I'll respond to everything but I'm doing my best.

**edit** 1530EST - I'm replying and now it's at 1125 new messages.  Thank you all for your contributions and I am continuing to work at my plodding pace.  I couldn't dedicate today to replies like I have done previously, so it's nowhere near fast enough to reply.

**edit** 1800EST I have to formally say here, and sorry that those who don't get a reply,  that I can't provide specific medical advice on reddit.  I'll do my best but there are many people who are posting their personal stories.  I've read them. I care.  I hope help is available and I feel my other responses have addressed a lot of what my general advice would be.  I will reply where I can but there is an overwhelming amount to get through. 

**edit** 2030 EST I have to tap out now... I will try my best to get to questions I feel are left unanswered but I should probably turn off the faucet now.  For those who have shared stories, thank you, and I'm sorry I couldn't get to everyone.  Today was truly epic and eye opening to how much more I need to get more public messaging out there.  

If there's one thing i want everyone here to know, it's the following phrase for the people in your life:  "hey just to let you know, if you ever need me, give me a call, I really care about you."

**edit 0430am: thank you all! I put my best effort in and thank you to amazing redditors who also stepped up.  Good night reddit!**
Do you think there is ever a scenario where a perfectly healthy adult can decide he doesn't want to be alive anymore and would it be ethical for him to follow through with such a notion?
That sounds like there's some sort of depression at play there.
I think like that but I have dealt with depression and I know it's because of previous thoughts about killing myself.
For clarity, those kinds of thoughts tell me I am still depressed at times.
They mainly pop up in my head when I'm on the internet reading about stupid things people say and do.
In my head I would love to just drop dead at that point leaving this chaotic world behind.
BUT life still has so much to offer so why not see where it takes me?
Assisted suicide is typically reserved for terminally ill patients as sometimes emotional turmoil can be treated. It is a huge ethical dilemma because many think people should be able to make that choice for themselves, while others believe it would be a total tragedy to assist in someone’s death if in a year they could be put back on the right track.
I kind of look at it like this. We will 100% die. It is very final and there is no undoing it. So what is the rush? 

Try my best to enjoy life and let death do its thing later. Worst case scenario I am dead but was miserable up until then. Still dead.

Best case I am also still dead but at least I enjoyed the ride the best I could.
Even the person who lives the worst life has so much potential. Bed ridden, relying on a team of people to live yet fighting for life.
The future is full of promising technology, the thought of which gives me hope and excitement.
Also, this probably sounds stupid but smile when you feel like shit.
Force that smile out and hold it for as long as you need.
This makes me feel better. I've been struggling with hardcore dissociation for a while, making me feel like life isn't real and stuff... sometimes my mind has dark thoughts, never any plans or ideations luckily. It just feels like there's no option probably. Before this I was a positive person most of the time. I'm getting better. But this just helped me and I wanted to say it. 

It feels like I'm in a dream sometimes
Glad to hear it! How old are you? If you do not mind me asking.

I am getting really close to 30 and I think I kind of know how you feel. I would not say I have any dark thoughts like that but can for sure say I know how you feel about life not being real and stuff. 

I think for me it comes from just realizing I am just a normal person. 1 out of 8 billion who will make little impact on this world and when I am dead I will just be gone forever and forgotten not long after that. So imo I should just enjoy what I can. Travel. Meet new people. Do new things.
I dont struggle to smile. I actually really enjoy life. I do struggle with anxiety but it is what it is.

Life is huge and full of possibilities!
&gt; Even the person who lives the worst life has so much potential.

But is it our right to keep them suffering for their potential? Not a rhetorical question.
That's a moral dilemma I'm not qualified to talk about
The way I see it is we will 100% die.  It is very final and there is no undoing it.  So why wait?

&amp;#x200B;

Why do people feel so obligated to find fulfillment in being alive?  What's so wrong about wanting to die?  Why are people so critical to those who don't enjoy life?  Because there is "so much to do" but maybe I just don't like life and don't want to do anything.  Why is that so hard for people to accept?  If I could die without risk of rendering myself a vegetable instead of actually dying, I would have been dead.
You suffer from depersonalization too? I'm sorry to hear that. It really sucks. I'm almost 23, btw. I actually like the feeling of being normal. When I feel dissociation, I feel like I'm an alien. I love traveling and meeting people, but I also enjoy feeling normal and grounded..which isn't that common nowadays. This is all rooted in anxiety and I hate it.
I will not tell you how to live your life. Pretty sure this will sound like a broken record but that sounds like depression. Talk to someone about it. Just let it all out

Serious question. Do you have a desire to not feel that way? Maybe even just a little bit?
Healthy people, under significant stressors, for example, can and do rationally choose suicide.  People who value quality of life over longevity do as well.  Even within illness, I am personally in support of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) for conditions for which there is an expectation of severe suffering with no treatment, or palliative care.

The ethics of suicide are tricky, because we are social beings connected to others.  People are severely negatively effected by the death of a friend, coworker, colleague, former classmate, current classmate, family member, etc (even angry ones).  It is NOT a harmless move.  The ethical principles of autonomy apply, but when it comes to harm and beneficence, there is usually a significant imbalance on the harm aspect to others vs the beneficence.  

Hopefully this answers the question.  Due to the high visibility of this thread and concern about contagion/misinterpretation, I tend not to like to publically post about ethical reasons justifying suicide.  But I would be happy to discuss in private.
Let what out?  A desire to not want to die?  No.  And not even.
A little bit I think. But it seems to me like most people would feel that way at some point or another. 

Can you explain what you mean by feeling normal and grounded as not being that common nowadays? I do not understand.
That's fair, I think it's tricky.
Then idk man. I am not physiologist or even remotely anything resembling it. 

I really do wish you the best of luck. It may not mean much but I do mean it. Love you stranger.
Usually I just feel like I'm in a 2d painting or something, like I'm on some type of drug, even though I'm totally sober (besides some psychiatric meds, nothing recreational, not even caffeine). It's not really rare, but it *feels* like it's this unique experience that will never go away, that no one understands, that no one can help me with. But I try to tell myself all the time it's just a feeling, all the evidence points that way. I've had extensive tests done on my body and brain and I'm perfectly healthy.
O wow that is wild! I have never quite felt like that. I know what you mean about trying to tell yourself its just a feeling though. I have to do that also when I get anxiety. 

If you do not mind me asking. Is it scary? How long have you had that happen?
It can be scary. I've been experiencing it for about 6 months but it's definitely gotten better. When it all culminated I couldn't even eat a full meal and I couldn't sit still. It was horrifying. Now I went back to work and school, but I'm uncomfortable nearly all day.. Some experience it much longer, some only for an hour or so.
[removed]
Wtf? Could you please grow up enough to not say shit like that in a thread like this?
Well I certainly hope it gets better. I do know what its like to be uncomfortable. 

Today has been a little rough for me anxiety wise. No full blown panic attacks or anything like that. Just uncomfortable.
Same here actually. Feels like my skin is crawling a bit
[deleted]
If "growing up" means showing compassion to a serial rapist, then call me Peter Pan.
Not OP, but if it's causing you significant mental distress and you're losing sleep, you should probably seek professional help.
No it means having the tact to not encourage suicide in a thread about suicide prevention. Doesn't matter who, Pete.
I deeply take issue with your implication that suicidal people shouldn't opt out because their suffering isn't equal to the suffering their loss would cause. Firstly, you, and others, do not live in their mind and thus have no way of understanding what misery that they experience every waking moment. As a result, you have no basis for declaring that their suffering doesn't justify death. Secondly, it's horrifying that you advocate to have someone tortured for the benefit of your feelings through forced existence rather than granting them the autonomy to end their suffering.
So, you think suicide can be the correct choice for a miserable person and people are usually just being selfish by discouraging suicide because it makes them feel bad?

I think that's a good point, and both of our usernames are relevant.
&gt; Why do people feel so obligated to find fulfillment in being alive? What's so wrong about wanting to die? Why are people so critical to those who don't enjoy life? Because there is "so much to do" but maybe I just don't like life and don't want to do anything. Why is that so hard for people to accept? If I could die without risk of rendering myself a vegetable instead of actually dying, I would have been dead.

I have discussed this at length with a friend of mine and I think this has a lot to do with how a person defines death. I for one don't believe in an afterlife or anything. I think it will just be a void and your consciousness is gone, you are gone, everything of a person is just gone. And if you look at it like that, death is quite a sad thing. You miss out on everything that exists, you will no longer enjoy music in your ears. Or a beautiful view. Or a tasty food.  
But then again who says it is like that? Death could be a true afterlife which is actually better than this life. Nobody knows. And depending on your definition, your beliefs and your opinion, your opinion on the matter of life vs death will differ greatly.
You are 100% correct; that is the position I'm taking.
&gt; You miss out on everything that exists, you will no longer enjoy music in your ears. Or a beautiful view. Or a tasty food.

Who's to say that they would've enjoyed it?
I understand what you're saying but I'm not sure that's an accurate summarization of his words.

He stated that it's not harmless, and thus not an ETHICALLY bulletproof, for lack of a better word, decision to take one's life. He didn't draw any equivalencies about suffering.

In fact, he was still speaking on your scenario of a "healthy adult".

Edit: for the record, I personally think anyone who says suicide is selfish hasn't been close to it, whether themselves or loved ones. So I definitely understand what you're saying.
I want to start of by saying that I respect your point and think that it is a valid opinion to hold. However, I think you are misinterpreting Dr. Black's comment. 

He is not telling people what they should or shouldn't do, in his first paragraph he even states that he is in favor of Medical Assistance in Dying for cases of severe suffering. His second paragraph, which I assume you took issue with, is strictly talking about the ethics of suicide. Everyone is still an autonomous being, which means they are both allowed to make, but also responsible for their own choices. 

Ethically speaking, he is asking people to consider the harm and often very real damage a suicide causes in the immediate surroundings  of the person considering, wich, besides emotional suffering also includes the statistical likelihood of suicide for everyone left behind increasing dramatically. I don't think this is ultimately about measuring up the amounts of suffering against each other as much as about a person taking responsibility for their choice and recognising that it might be unethical, even if it may be a perfectly rational choice for them.
I only disagree with the "people are usually just being selfish by discouraging suicide because it makes them feel bad" part.

I think most people think that their friend/family member's/etc. sadness and pain can one day end and they can experience a happy life that is worth the previous pain. 

Especially if the person trying to prevent suicide has been in a similar place and is now happy, wanting their loved one to get through it too.

I agree that choice is ultimately up to the individual though.
I understand your point that suicide is by no means a self contained action. In fact, I firmly believe that those who wish to die should consider the ramifications of their potential action on the world once they are gone before making their choice. However, I am firmly against the idea that suicide without malicious intent is potentially unethical, as per my previously stated position I believe that the individual is the only person who is capable of determining if their anguish is justified by death. Any judgement passed on them for their choice is nessisarily self serving because it denies the reality they experienced in favor of a narrative where they are the aggressor and the survivors are the victims.

I also take issue with Dr. Black's first paragraph where they state they are supportive of suicide in cases of extreme and incurable suffering, because the way they worded their point of view seems to me to imply that the suffering in question is related to physical ailments. It baffles me that mental suffering is somehow not an ailment worthy of assisted suicide. Furthermore, it again suggests that the only people capable of determining your level of suffering are people who aren't you, and already most likely take the position that mental suffering is not "real suffering", in the sense that it could possibly be worth dying for.

As a final point, I reject the notion that anyone who is experiencing suffering to the point of suicide is in any way able to be described as "healthy". It trivializes their suffering by implying that their suffering is a reflection of reality. Dr. Black explicitly answers in his second paragraph in regards to a "healthy" person desiring suicide.
&gt; Even within illness, I am personally in support of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) for conditions for which there is an expectation of severe suffering with no treatment, or palliative care.
&gt; 
&gt; 

For me, I have headakes constantly, every day, for the past 15-20 years. While the pain is only occasionally (about once a week) to the point where I can't stand it, the pain also prevents me from even enjoying life and continues to make my depression worst. Other than that I am a functional person.

I'm guessing I would not qualify for the "severe suffering" part. Not like I am missing a leg or have my insides trying to eat each other (although my brain often feels like it just wants to escape my head).
This is the main thing that I don't really think most people understand unless you've dealt with this or have spent a lot of time around people like this.

  Some people stopped enjoying all those things + everything else already. Tasty food turns into a negative thing because it's just adding more weight to you making you more fat.  And outside is for normal people. So fuck that.  And the music someone liked is getting stale and new music is just shit. 

  Not saying I think like this, it's just how some people think.
Have you ever thought about life as objectively as possible and without rose colored emotions? What is the point of waking up and going to work everyday, making paper money and accumulating "things"? In the end we all die with nothing and making no cosmic change or impact on anything. Sometimes you're just tired of trying to pretend everything means something /is significant. Just tired. It's like trying to keep someone awake for days or months with zero sleep. You can tell me "look at how pretty or amazing this is" as much as you want but my eyes are just tired and are closing involuntarily. I'm not sad or unhappy, just tired.
A major point is 1) everyone dies and people will be effected by your death eventually no matter when it is. 2) Suicide is seen as worse due to stigma, the believe life is always worth it etc. I personally find it ludicrous to blame someone who committed suicide for 2) as it seems more of a societal view than anything else.
I do not see it like that at all. In the same way that you say that you do not live in the possible suicider's mind, when a suicider, you don't live in your family/etc's mind, you have no basis for declaring that their suffering is worth the finishing of your suffering, you don't know what the effect of a decision that final can have. I think it's horrifying that you advocate to put guilt, suffering and torture for the complete finalization of a supposed torture without giving the chance to overcome it.
Your point that nobody knows the mind of others is valid. However, it follows that since nobody can know the suffering of others, people should fuck off and let people do what they will to their body since they are the expert on whether they should live or die.
I definitively agree
His argument about whether suicide is ethical or not is based solely on the Act Utilitarianism ethical theory where you weigh the beneficial and harmful outcomes against each other from an objective point of view (i.e. suffering of one &lt; suffering of many). It’s a known flaw of Act Utilitarianism that it’s almost impossible to actually measure the pros and cons of a moral decision, so in the real world its ineffective at a large scale and can’t apply equally to every situation. However, when speaking theoretically (as done here) it’s just fine to talk about that perspective as food for thought. There is never going to be a correct answer to “could suicide be ethical?”, which appears to be what you’re looking for.
Thank you for your well thought out reply. I agree with some of your points, but I want to, again, state my opinions, as I think presenting differing points of view on any issue as complex can potentially be beneficial for the broader discourse.

First of, I think the denial of the reality experienced by the suicidal person you describe is just a coping mechanism formed by people unable or unwilling to relate to the amount of suffering a suicidal person endures, but I do not condemn them for this, as everyone is, to a certain degree, trapped within their own perspective and frame of reference. Because we are social animals, I would say that judging and evaluating the actions of others around us is a necessary process wich is always motivated by certain amount of selfish intent.

Second, I think we disagree in our reading of Dr. Black's comment. I did not see him denying the validity of mental suffering in his first paragraph, although on repeat reading I can see how you got that impression. However, I still disagree with your reading. I think his first two sentences even support your stance, he is just using the phrase 'significant stressors' to describe the mental anguish you are talking about.

I am not sure how I feel about your critique about the judgement of outsiders being necessary to determine how much an individual is suffering. On one hand I want to agree with you that the only one truly capable of judging it's condition is the autonomous individual itself. On the other hand, philosophy has proven that we live in a perceived reality, and that our perception is flawed, which, in my opinion, would almost necessitate outside reflection of one's problems before being medically enabled to take the most drastic measure.

Finally, getting back to my disagreement with your reading, I would say that his second paragraph is applicable, no matter the nature of the suffering a person endures. Also I think that he purposefully avoided any use of words like "healthy" to describe the people he is talking about, as to not marginalise the suffering of anybody. 

I still stand by my point that suicide without malicious intent can, under certain conditions, be unethical, but I feel like we agree on the fundamentals here and would just be arguing semantics. Regardless, thank you for your time. It was quite difficult to formulate my thoughts on this, but I really enjoyed it and apologise for any mistakes I made in reading your, and writing my comment, as English is not my first language.
Thank you for engaging with me :)
I have spoken with a good friend of mine who suffers from severe clinical depression who described it exactly as you did.

I have felt tired I think like most people do in their life but even when I was tired I still felt hopeful and knew it would change. I cannot explain it but I do know those things in the end do not matter in a cosmic sense. But to me as a person they do matter. For one reason or another they make me feel a certain way.
I'm enjoying this discussion and thank you both for this ongoing continuation of my reply. I'm sorry my words were unclear.  I wanted to clarify that I absolutely consider mental suffering in the same vein as physical suffering as it pertains to medical assistance in dying.

I feel the topic is being well discussed, and I've provided my thoughts but I recognize that my thoughts are my interpreting of the ethics, not a rule.  I'm  not intending to invalidate other viewpoints, and society should be tackling this important issue (and many are).
Does MAID take into consideration mental aspects? The irony of me asking here when the ladies who did the policy work sit across the floor from me.
It's not just death that gets blamed on the deceased, but pretty much all illness in the US. Everyone seems to offer something like "Eat more of this or less of that", "Try this alternative medicine", or simply "Try to think more positive thoughts". All of these supposedly well-meaning messages are actually expressing the meta-message of "You are doing it wrong so it's your own fault". Let's instead make sure the underlying message we express is "I'm truly sorry that you have X, that must really suck".
It didn't originally but it was going to be a human rights violation so now it does by rule.
It's easy to say "people should fuck off" but, truth is people don't fuck off that easily, it just seems unrealistic to think that it happens universally. Maybe I'm entering in the same mystical land as you but if we're on the assumption game, I'd rather assume that empathy can be acquired and taught and choosing to fuck off less, whether you're the one suffering the most or not (if those categories can be ranked that way). Obviously if someone's already offed himself I am empathetic to their suffering in the way I can, and I am not going to judge them on their options, and deeply understand that they were not in  a place to start considering other people's suffering, and also I will not pretend to know better than them, but that doesn't mean that I think that it couldn't have been prevented and that rather than be content with not knowing the mind of others I prefer to take the "understanding I don't know their minds but still try to, and show them that they are also not knowing a lot of minds that might be of relevance" (figurative me, i'm not showing anybody anything, just reflecting my philosophy on that)

And the words "they are the expert on whether they should live or die" when you just said that they're under enormous misery sound like exact opposites, someone with their emotions that misjudged seems like it's not really capable of deciding on their terms whether they should live or die, even if they assume the rest would fuck off and let them do what they want
I was at my therapist today and bumpt into a girl standing at the door. She looked lost, so i asked her if I could help her with something. Her eyes were teary and she said that she didn’t have an appointment, but was there because she wants to kill herself. I felt in shock and told her to come inside with me, and that i would find her a therapist she could talk to. It took a while for someone to arrive. In the meantime I was waiting with her. What was the appropriate thing to say to her or to do at that moment? 
And in a hypothetical situation, if there are no professionals available, what should you say to someone that has specific suicidal plans?
That sounds incredibly tough, I think I'd just ask some non-threatening questions to try and work out if they're in immediate danger of abuse or something, and calm them a bit. Easier said than done
Holy cats, you did awesome!!  

The best phrase when you're stuck is some form of:
"I really want to help, what can I do right now while we wait to find a professional, even if it only slightly helps?"  If they have nothing, then provide some suggestions "maybe lets go chat over a hot chocolate?" or "would you like to go for a walk?"

But you're a hero!!
Wow, didn’t expect you to actually see my comment, thank you for replying! And I definitely didn’t feel like a hero, more a awkward human pillar standing by her for help to arrive, but your suggestion are really helpful. Thanks and have a great evening
I think you did the right thing, just staying with her and making sure someone qualified can help her. I don't think there's much you can say especially if they aren't willing to open up about things. Letting them know you are there for them and care about their well-being goes a long way.
How is this not higher up, you're amazing and defiantly the bamf of at least the month. Thank you for doing this!
Just think that there was probably no way of her killing herself with you standing there because you wouldn't have let her actually do it. If you had walked past there might have been nothing stopping her from i.e. swallowing some pills she brought in her pocket. Whatever you think I bet that people would argue you saved her life, and for that you are a hero.
and crucially the person demonstrated by staying with her that they care.
Username checks out, as in "Hello, hell no will I let that happen".
Thank you so much for doing this. 🙂
You showed her someone cared when she thought nobody would notice or care if she died. You took the reigns and handled a scary situation; not everybody can care for a suicidal person like you did.
I've been this girl... thank you so much for doing what you did for her, not treating her like a freak, not panicking or anything.  I would've LOVED to have someone do as much for me at that time.
Hi, just want to say, glad that you’re still here :)
Do you believe weaponized psychology has anything to do with the relative uptick in suicides?
Can you clarify?  Are you specifically referring to torture/control programs or another definition I'm not aware of.
Yes, I am asking to what extent you believe weaponized psychology techniques as developed by various governments, agencies, independent researchers dating back to WW2 or farther have made it into the wild and are being used by unknown actors to induce or exacerbate suicidal thoughts, tendencies, or actions to include those involving homicidal actions.
A very very small effect, I'd be surprised if it was detectably above zero.
Undetectable murder technique?
Do you have any evidence of this?  Gotta admit to this layperson it sounds a little bit crankpotty.
I suppose that is why the layperson is a layperson.
Also, not really something I'd like to see go mainstream. If I had evidence, I wouldn't be sharing it. I'd be squashing the people involved like cockroaches with a scorched earth chaser.
Most of the more salacious ideas in this field of psychology were very ineffective, so I doubt it.
That isn't the proper use of the word "salacious". Are you sure you are a Doctor?
Yup!  My particular specialty is misusing the word salacious.  I stand corrected. Scandalous.
Is that published and peer-reviewed?
Please be more specific.
It was a sarcastic response to your flippant response when I questioned your credibility and motivation in the use of the word "salacious". Just pushing your buttons, doc.
Ah no, I get that... I did feel that maybe you wanted to discuss something about psychiatry that could be worth discussing though?  Anyway if you're just trollin' around fair enough!
My initial interests were academic and professional. However, I don't think you are taking the issues seriously nor have you indicated a sufficient background to discuss them professionally. 
Psychiatry is a black box profession without direct support from medical imaging. If you don't have the necessary expertise, then we are just blowing smoke.
Too bad.  Misinformation is truly a problem.
Has been since the Garden of Eden.

Summary:
I do not see it like that at all.
I actually like the feeling of being normal.
I actually really enjoy life.
Not saying I think like this, it's just how some people think.
But this just helped me and I wanted to say it.
But then again who says it is like that?
I do know what its like to be uncomfortable.
I will not tell you how to live your life.
I will be replying through the day.
I kind of look at it like this.
Thank you so much for doing this.
But it seems to me like most people would feel that way at some point or another.
I know what you mean about trying to tell yourself its just a feeling though.
So I definitely understand what you're saying.
Thank you for doing this!
I have to do that also when I get anxiety.
A little bit I think.
But I try to tell myself all the time it's just a feeling, all the evidence points that way.
Even the person who lives the worst life has so much potential.
I for one don't believe in an afterlife or anything.
Why are people so critical to those who don't enjoy life?
The way I see it is we will 100% die.
It may not mean much but I do mean it.
It feels like I'm in a dream sometimes.
I dont struggle to smile.
Other than that I am a functional person.
I do struggle with anxiety but it is what it is.
But to me as a person they do matter.
However, I still disagree with your reading.
&gt; Even the person who lives the worst life has so much potential.
or "would you like to go for a walk?"
I think you did the right thing, just staying with her and making sure someone qualified can help her.
Because there is "so much to do" but maybe I just don't like life and don't want to do anything.
I would've LOVED to have someone do as much for me at that time.
It just feels like there's no option probably.
