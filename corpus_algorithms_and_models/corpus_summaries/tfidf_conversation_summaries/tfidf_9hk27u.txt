### Custom Latias/Latios
I'm offering custom redeemed PAL Latias/Latios from the upcoming event and looking to get some of the events that I've missed. I can do them on SuMo or USUM, on fresh saves (i.e. the saves are not managed). I can RNG* them to have good IVs if you would like, otherwise I can do standard redeems.

## I will provide proof similar to this:

### Legendary and Ultra Beast RNGs

I have just completed the main story on Ultra Sun and can RNG* some legendaries. They will all have OT: Nitro and ID: 638853.

As I haven’t caught any of these yet I can RNG the following pokemon to your specifications (Nature, Shiny, Spread, Ball Preference (within reason), Nickname). I can provide proof with all RNGs upon request.

### Custom ESV Shinies Service

I can also RNG* custom ESV eggs that will hatch shiny on your game. I have a medium sized collection of Pokémon in special balls with egg moves. Just check the sheet [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13dLjGgyp2nQHE2kRW-te5eh_TZwvUgAzPrP8ix9oTts/edit?usp=sharing) for what breedables I currently have in Gen 7 and Gen 6.

My native Vivillon pattern is River.

### Demo Pokemon (Ash Greninjas, Mega Steelix, Mega Glalie)

I can also offer self-obtained custom Ash Greninjas (ENG or JPN tagged). Natures on Steelix (JPN 3DS) and Glalie (PAL 3DS) will be random, ORAS demo saves wiped using JKSM.


### 4th and 5th Gen RNG Service

I can also do custom 4th and 5th Gen RNG* including breeding and legendary captures. I can do custom playthroughs with your OT for good offers.


### RNG Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi

I can also offer Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi (OT: WISHMKR, ID: 20043). This process is done entirely on emulator (using Dolphin, VBA-M, wishmakercalc and lua script). I will provide unique screenshots of the RNG process for each Jirachi. Also note that Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi have static PID so are natural clones, here is a list of obtainable natures/spreads: [Link] (https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/rdxEbTm4/). Jirachi will be brought up to current gen by transferring to my retail emerald cartridge using pkhex and gbasavetool then solely using retail cartridges from gen 3 to gen 6 or 7 (Pal Park -&gt; Poke Transfer -&gt; Pokemon Transporter).

* Shiny Wishmaker Jirachi's currently on hand: None

### Items

I also have extra Gold Bottle Caps and some battle items that I don't really use. I'd be willing to trade these for NA codes (Zygarde, T/T, L/L, Poipole).


##Wishlist:

* PAL Poipole Codes
* Ryota Otsubo's Golduck
* WCSK Metagross
* KOR Alamos Darkrai
* KOR Aether Silvally
* PAL or NA Heatran/Regigigas (USUM/Level 100 versions preferred)
* Daisuke Solrock (KOR tagged)
* Other event offers (not high priority): Clovis Salazzle (Modest), Shiny Tapu Koko, Cap Pikas, Event Rockruffs/Lycanroc, Hajime Syacho's Corsola, Sorrel's Lucario


Thanks for looking
