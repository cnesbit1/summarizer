Original Response:
[xyoras]Finally got myself a copy of X!! I'm looking for some help to do an egglocke of the game, so was wondering if you guys could help me get a party of 6 by trading me eggs (without telling me the contents or anything)

If you want something in exchange, I've got a few female DB Pokemon (No HA) or a few male DBHA Pokemon, all with 4EM in my AS I could give you.

Thanks for the help, I'm hoping I get something exciting.

EDIT: Have the following that fit the above criteria 

* Aerodactyl (2F, 2M)
* Axew( 1M)
* Omanyte (No HA, 3M)
* Murkrow (3F)
* Munna (1F)
* Starly (4F) 
* Karrablast (1M)
* Buneary (1M)

In addition, I have a few DBHA females that have forgotten their eggmoves, meaning they're useless to me but could be good for you. These are: 

* Hoppip
* Mareep
* Hippopotas
* Axew 
* Murkrow
* Shelmet
Do you still need help?
I think I should be good, unless you have something particularly awesome you want to give me or you see something of mine you really want.
You just want an egg for one of your Pokémon?
If you just want one, I don't mind just giving you it. I think I have enough eggs, unless theres a special ball egg you feel like gifting.
I’ll take the omanyte if it’s possible
If none of the other guys who came first want it, sure :D
Are you online?
Yeah I am, but in X atm.
Is the omanyte still available
It is. Do you have any eggs you're willing to trade for it?
I’ll breed something now if you still have omanyte
I have several eggs now
Awesome. If you're still on I don't mind trading in the next 20-30 minutes. Otherwise give me a time frame and I'll be ready :D
Do you just need one?
I was thinking like three, but I'll take two if they're in special balls or have their HA or something
I’ll work on two other species then

Summary:
If you just want one, I don't mind just giving you it.
I have several eggs now.
