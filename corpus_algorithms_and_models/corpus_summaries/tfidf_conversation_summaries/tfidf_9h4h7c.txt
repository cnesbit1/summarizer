Original Response:
While this is a noble thought, wouldn’t it be like most crimes committed by a minor and their records sealed? I mean, unless the minor is prosecuted as an adult, criminal records are sealed for minors.
a lot of people in threads about this kavanaugh thing keep getting confused about requirements for a *legal* judgment, vs. requirements for forming a *personal* judgment.

OP was talking about the latter.  You are talking about the former.
A 17 year-old who commits rape is usually considered an adult. Older teenagers generally only get to be tried as minors for less significant crimes.
Right?  It's like nobody arguing about this has the simplest grasp of what the legal process is or what it's supposed to do.
Ahhh...trying to get a conviction in the Court of Public Opinion. Gotcha...
Gotcha....
Anytime someone forms a negative opinion, the subject has been convicted in the court of public opinion.    That's what a negative opinion is.

There's going to be a decision on this guy one way or another.  Either the public is going to call him a liar, or call his accuser a liar.  Those are the only two outcomes.  Somebody is going to have their reputation smeared.  Deal with it.
True, but the sealing of records does not happen automatically. It has to be reviewed by a judge and may not be approved. For a 17yo, they may at the least wait a while to see if there's recidivism. 

Sealed records are also not sealed to everyone. The military, for example, see everything. It's also reviewed during government background checks, like this one. They probably wouldn't bring it up in the public hearings though.
What do you think people aren’t grasping that you are?
Commission of a serious, violent felony at 17 should (and in many case does) result in being tried as an adult.

Rape, or attempted rape, is not "most crimes."  To suggest it should be sealed like a minor in possession or petty theft charge downplays its severity.  Which is the whole point of OP's post.
I hate how that phrase is misused when it’s convenient, too. As if  garnering approval OR disapproval from “the court of public opinion” is an unthinkable, irresponsibly negative thing, and not a necessary step in the placement of any elected or appointed official. Why else do we have presidential debates? To allow the public to form an opinion of the candidates in question based on their positions and responses. You know, in the court of public opinion.

Government servants serve the government. The government is supposed to serve the public. The public approves or disapproves of their officials and representatives. That shouldn’t be considered a bug in a representative democracy, it’s a feature.
We're also talking about the difference between criminal punishment and a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land
Well, there are other possible outcomes. Namely that he's known as a liar, but still gets the job. Which will be bad.
I mean, yeah. He's up for a vote of confidence by our Representatives, not on trial. Public opinion is the only thing that ever mattered here, even before these allegations.

That was the first of the two outcomes I listed.  :-P
Ha! You're right. I thought you said: he'll be called a liar, and not get the job; or his accuser will be considered a liar, and he will get the job. What I'm saying is he could be essentially proven a liar, but still get the job, and so his reputation will not be sufficiently smeared to make the "decision on this guy" rationally tied to his clear misdeeds. He's already lied under oath several times on things unrelated to this sex crime, and no one cares.

But it would be nice for the Anita Hill karma to finally work itself out here. Or maybe we need this guy on the supreme court, and then the senate can impeach him and Thomas at the same time in the near future.
Even before the allegations his approval among voters and both the house and Senate was at a historical low for any SCOTUS nominee. All it would take is two republicans deciding they can't support him for the position and he will be out.
Well, according to this forum, at least, he is guilty. Hence a conviction in the Court of Public Opinion.

I agree with this sentiment.

I also think persons accused of crimes should not be up for Senate confirmation.

I also think, that the accused should be assumed innocent until proven guilty.
