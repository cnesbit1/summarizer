Original Response:
Whoa... You know you done some bad shit when they send SWAT to come get you.
Or you have some small quantities of drugs.
Or you went fishing illegally.
Or made fun of the government
Or you jaywalked
Or you smoked under a shelter
Or kept loli
Or Bought Malaysian Newspaper
Or you utterly wrecked the chief of police in a game of CS:GO
If that happens they come for you in the middle of the night, not in broad daylight
Or chewing gum
or forgot to pay IRAS
Or illegal football betting like in the ad.
Just do it in incognito and FBI bochup
Or maybe you've won some online game and that sore loser think swatting is funny.
or it was Just a Prank Bro
or you drank water on the mrt
The SPF would like to know your location
Or you neh download the SGsecure app
Or you jaywalked on the way home

Summary:
Or you jaywalked on the way home.
Or you went fishing illegally.
