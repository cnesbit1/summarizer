yes its bother line emotional affair, and it sounds like there are some issues that needs to be addressed. Thus, i suggest to talk to a couple therapist.

this is why i think that you guys need to go to couple's therapy. 

it sounds like he is unhappy in the marriage, and isn't taking your feelings into account. If you guys don't address the deeper issues, im not sure that your marriage will last long.

first ask yourself, "do you want to try save the marriage'?

if the answer is yes, as him the same question, if either of you say no then start planning for divorce.

If you both say yes, then talk to a therapist. A therapist will give you better advice than anyone can give here.

The first thing to go is therapy because he doesn't WANT to work on his issues, not that it doesn't work. That's like saying physical therapy doesn't work when you never do the exercises they give you

Honestly, reading over your posts OP.  It sounds like you have a lot of negative energy.  Please don't confuse that with a negative attitude, I mean YOU attract negative things.  Illness, disease, and injury.  Bad things just keep happening to you, and they don't let up.  And not just you, but those close to you.  

That said, I would recommend church, and prayer.  

Otherwise, do some research on yoga, and chaktras.  I do not believe a therapist will help you.  You need to do some inner soul searching, and you need to find a source of spiritual strength to help you face down your demons.

Well their are 2 things you've pointed out.  You husband holds all the cards, you'd loose everything if your marriage dissolved.  And he has lost faith in therapist ability to help you.  

The AA definition of insanity, is to do the same thing, over and over again, expecting different results each time.  

The steps you've taken to handle your mental illness, are not working.  Your husband sees this, and he's near his breaking point.  Thats what this sound like to me, he's looking for an exit.  

So you can continue to deal with this, in the same way, that has already failed.  Or you can look for another path.
