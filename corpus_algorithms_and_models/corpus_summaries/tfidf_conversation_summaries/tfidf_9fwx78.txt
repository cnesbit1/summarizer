Why do I think this?

Look at human societies with very long life expectancies - Japan, the EU, and to some extent the US. All of them have a large percentage of the population who are in effect dinosaurs, having been raised in a world very different from that they live in, and this generation gap creates tension and misunderstanding and is a big part of the political strife those societies face.

There's something fundamentally off about a society without children. To have a society with children, you need either an endlessly growing population or death. This implies that society in a static afterlife would be very unnerving and might feel like a dystopia.

On the other hand, reincarnation allows for a society that resembles our own... And I'm not even getting into how the idea of a cycle of oblivion and emergence of consciousness fits the knowledge of our universe.
