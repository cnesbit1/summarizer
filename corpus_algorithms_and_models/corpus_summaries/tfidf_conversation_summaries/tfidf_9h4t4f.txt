Original Response:
If other countries are bothered, they can pay for their own experiments.
That’s not how it works. You don’t just sit counting your marbles and just watch everybody else play. 
The experiment was very important for Ontario and the tax payers of Ontario. If we’ll done the knowledge would help us understand how to best spend those dollars (maybe less of them actually) to get maximum impact, and at the same time have everyone be better off for it. Knowledge is power.
What is the benefit for Canadians to be the ones to do the experiment? It has a potential negative impact for canadians. That can be avoided by letting others do the experiment and seeing the results.
You've described every experiment ever.

Yes, we should lose all ambition to better our society, to play it safe and keep the status quo.
Lol this is the most mind numbing nonsense I've seen around here in a while.

So we should just not research anything ever then I guess?
&gt;You've described every experiment ever.

Wrong. Every experiment ever does not use taxpayer funds, nor are the results of every experiment always released to everyone.

&gt;Yes, we should lose all ambition to better our society, to play it safe and keep the status quo. 

Should not risk harming canadian citizens on the experiment. It is objectively better to let another nation do the experiment and see their results. You avoid any downside and enjoy all the benefits.
That is just complete nonsense. The only way to know if this is even possible in Canada is by running the experiment in Canada.
&gt;Every experiment ever does not use taxpayer funds,

The vast majority are.

&gt;nor are the results of every experiment always released to everyone

The vast majority are.

&gt;Should not risk harming canadian citizens on the experiment

Canceling this experiment will harm Canadians letting it continue would not.

&gt;It is objectively better to let another nation do the experiment and see their results

This is just false. Objectively. If you do not understand why think for half a second 

&gt; You avoid any downside and enjoy all the benefits

This is nonsense.
You should tell that to all those social scientists waiting for the results. They don't need to concern themselves with the experiment! it's of no value to them.
Different circumstances for different countries. Using that data could be dangerous. Do you know anything about experiments?
&gt; Wrong. Every experiment ever does not use taxpayer funds, nor are the results of every experiment always released to everyone.
&gt; 

Every experiment any government conducts uses tax-payer money. And yes, the results are released to everyone. You just have to request them.
Glad you agree with me that it does not describe every experiment ever. 

\&gt; Canceling this experiment will harm Canadians letting it continue would not. 

It absolutely does harm canadians letting it continue

\&gt; This is just false. Objectively. If you do not understand why think for half a second 

It is objectively true. Use some critical thinking

\&gt; This is nonsense. 

Nope

&amp;#x200B;
Cool. What I said is still correct. Glad you don't disagree.
Better not tell all those social scientists hoping to see the results in Canada!
&gt;Should not risk harming canadian citizens on the experiment. It is objectively better to let another nation do the experiment and see their results. You avoid any downside and enjoy all the benefits.



One of the arguments I've seen on bike lanes in Toronto is that Toronto wasn't made for them and borrowing ideas and research from other countries wrongfully templates it on us.

The same could be said about the UBI pilot: it might not work the same here as elsewhere. Even if it does, the model would need to be tweaked.

That's how research works. Particularly the kind that changes certain social dynamics. Nobody is harmed through this experiment, while ending it prematurely will harm people who have made space for this program to improve their lives.
&gt;What is the benefit for Canadians to be the ones to do the experiment? It has a potential negative impact for canadians. That can be avoided by letting others do the experiment and seeing the results.

I disagree with the sentiment that we have to rely on other economies to do the research for us. The money invested in this experiment was a drop in the bucket compared to the bigger picture. Now more money is going to be spent suing the government for going back on it's end of those contracts without any due-diligence and time.
And once multiple countries have done UBI experiments you have more data on how it works in countries similar to your own. 

&gt;Nobody is harmed through this experiment

Many people are potentially harmed in this experiment. ex. taxpayers. 

It was not voluntary participation for those who are funding this. If they wen't up to people and asked them if they would like to voluntarily join the experiment and use their own money to supply the basic income then it would be a different situation.
The benefit of having a working program of universal basic income is one of efficiency: rather than paying into running multiple different programs - social assistance (welfare), employment insurance, disability, old age pension (CPP), etc - you replace it with a single program. That could mean a huge reduction in administration costs while providing better overall outcomes for those using the program. Further, this being done here means that we get the best data for *Canada*, not for France, Germany or Japan - because even if another country ran this exact kind of experiment, we'd still need to re-run it to make sure it works for us. 

Let's ask the more meaningful question: what is gained by cancelling this program? 

Ford has gained points with his base. 

In the negative column though...

We haven't gained any useful data thanks to Ford's meddling - even if it were to be reinstated this second, the problems Ford has caused have contaminated the results. 

We've lost millions of dollars for no useful data with more to be lost in legal battles. These costs will likely outstrip the cost of running the experiment rather quickly. 

Third, the current Ford government has lost a ton of trust.

In short this was a stupid, incompetent move by an unqualified moron.
&gt;I disagree with the sentiment that we have to rely on other economies to do the research for us

I agree, we don't have to rely on them. It is just beneficial to do so.

&gt;Now more money is going to be spent suing the government for going back on it's end of those contracts without any due-diligence and time.

Yea, that is the biggest risk.
How exactly does it harm Canadians to let it continue?
What a short-sighted opinion on the matter. If you polled the majority of people in Ontario (or Canada) they would be in favour of trying this out. It needs to be researched, perhaps it's the type of program that could actually save money.

Even if you don't agree with it in principal, as a Conservative I'd expect you to be concerned with the potential cost associated with shutting this down. It's going to be a bloodbath in the courts for the Ontario Gov't and probably going to cost a hell of a lot more than the program itself.
at a minimum, it harms taxpayers
&gt; It absolutely does harm canadians letting it continue

How? Please go beyond wasting tax money because you've obviously said that.  You need to explain why you think its a waste if that is your only answer. 

edit: a word
Are taxpayers also harmed with the futile cap-and-trade lawsuit?  I'm assuming that bothers you too then?
It's almost like Ontario has a new premier who is beginning to show a pattern of flouting the rules.
&gt;Please go beyond wasting tax money because you're obviously said that.

So you already agree with that then, it harms canadians
absolutely.
So you're suggesting just halt all government-funded research then?  Research based PhD/Master's programs - gut them.  Cancer research - in Canada? Never!  

I do not understand the antagonistic stance towards science.
Tax policy doesn't work that way; single people pay for public schools all the time, and it's a net improvement for all of society. Canada has funded research for a long time. In this case, the objection appears to be that the money is going directly back to a class of citizens as part of this three-year limited, budgeted pilot project, which was approaching it's final stretch.

Essentially money was spent and the work, for all intents, will be invalidated because some people *feel* that the very foundations were invalid.
It has potential negative AND positive impacts for Canadians. Shutting it down could have huge negative impacts... no doubt the courts will be consumed with this mess and it will end up potentially costing more than the program itself.

Conservatives amazingly don't care that it could cost more money in the long-run... that's fascinating to me.
Not an anatagonism towards science. I think it should be voluntarily driven.
It's an unnecessary, stupid risk that the PC government took on and now all we can do is watch the consequences unfold.

Either Ford will make the province settle out of court now, or he will exhaust the court system and waste money finding any excuse that works in his favour, and still lose and have to pay out settlements.

I don't see any way Doug can win this, and it's a matter of how much money Doug wants to waste pretending he's saving money.
there's a difference when talking about **what is** and **what should** be going on.

\&gt; and it's a net improvement for all of society. 

I'd disagree, I think there are significantly better options
It was poorly planned from the start as well. Obviously people are going to act differently receiving money for three years vs a permanent UBI. After 3 years you are still going to need to find a job and unlikely to want a gap in your resume.
No I just know that's their opinion and my statement said that.  Not sure how you assumed that is my opinion based on what I wrote.
Do you think that your methods are effective at anything but making your view seem juvenile and indefensible?
Then if you don't agree with it why are you saying not to talk about it harming tax payers?
I'm not you're just not reading my words I think. So ignore my previous posts and answer the below questions. 

Why do you think it harms Canadians if the experiment continued?
Why is it a waste of taxpayer money?
&gt; I'd disagree, I think there are significantly better options

Wouldn't it be great if we could run some kind of experiment to see if this were a good idea or not? Like, not commit to it full scale, just run sort of like a pilot program for a short time and see if it succeeds or fails. That way we would know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether or not it would be a good thing or a bad thing. If only there were some way we could get to the bottom of all this...
Quit your fucking games and answer the question. Oh wait you obviously can't and are just trolling.
https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot

&gt;**What will be measured**

&gt;The government will test how a basic income might help people living on low incomes better meet their basic needs, while improving outcomes in:

&gt;* food security

&gt;* stress and anxiety

&gt;* mental health

&gt;* health and healthcare usage

&gt;* housing stability

&gt;* education and training

&gt;* employment and labour market participation

&amp;nbsp;

Trying to find a job afterwards was already part of the plan

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Working and going to school during the pilot**

&gt;Participants can go to school to further their education or begin/continue to work while receiving the basic income. The basic income amount will decrease by $0.50 for every dollar an individual earns through work.
It's not that complicated. Did all tax payers voluntarily want to contribute to this experiment? If no, then they are harmed.
already did. Tax payers who do not want to be part of this are harmed. They have less disposable income.
Yea.. if only there was some way to do it on a voluntary basis...
tax payers have less disposable income, forced to give money to other people they do not want to. Harmed.
Most of our research is government funded.  It gives our industries competitive advantages on the global stage.
Any competitive advantage is lost when you release the results of your research. The advantage was knowledge that others do not have.
Almost all research projects in every university in Canada are funded, at least in part, by the government.

edit: grammar
So to counter that this program could reduce administrative costs and replace other social programs and be cheaper overall which means it benefits Canadians.  Without doing the experiment we won't know if that is true in practice .  Automation is coming and certain sectors will be hit faster than others that employ a lot of Canadians like the shipping industry.  This is one of the options that has been proposed to help mitigate the problem.  We won't know if it's a good option until someone does an actual experiment which this was.  Below is the best write-up I've read so far arguing for basic income. 

https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/data-universal-basic-income-us
Then nothing will get done unless there's an oil company or pharmacy involved then. 

We're just getting over the last ten years of disastrous meddling in funding, actually.
That's a good point, the intersection of R&amp;D and commerce is a tricky one but most of our best innovations have been government sponsored, and there are definitely avenues to monetize R&amp;D.
Well, perhaps that can convince people to be the ones to fund it voluntarily. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, if the government was to run the experiment and say we need to people to fund / send money to these people as part of this basic income experiment. Would you be willing?
Based on a lot of comments so far, I am sure there are lots of people who would send their own money to fund research projects.
So in your mind the government shouldnt' be responsible for coming up with solutions to the potential mass unemployment we could see in the future?  If that many people are unemployed and can't feed or house themselves with their paychecks what do you think that will do to law enforcement costs and crime rates?

This is a government problem not a donate and figure it out problem.  The solution has to come out of taxes because there is no other way for it to work. And yes I am willing which is why I vote for people who'd be willing to provide a program like this. At the end of the day that is the way we decide how our taxes are spent.  I don't make enough to fund experiments on my own but that's why governments do research projects like this .
*it doesn't work that way*
In my mind it should be a voluntary system. Mass unemployment will definitely hit once there is sufficiently advanced AI, then there will need to be a change since that essentially creates a slave population to do the work. That will likely just be nationalization of industries and a UBI.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
Never said it did. Just that it can. Surely, you would be willing to be part of that experiment where you and some other volunteers send money to them, right?
Mass unemployment will hit as soon as they have automated transport trucks on the road. New jobs will probably be created but there will be an inbetween which is what people are trying to brace for.  There is also people who argue setting up the social safety net with some form of basic income is cheaper in the long run which means taxes going to this type of thing is less overall per person using the programs.  If you look at how much money they give people it's not a life of luxury so that encourages people to get work.  It also allows people to take more risks and work for startups without worrying what happens if it goes under which could boost the economy. 

At the end of the day its hard to say until we do an experiment and analyze the results.
That's more an argument for why not to cancel it vs being the one to do it first. If it turns out that it costs more cancelling it then it would become a mistake financially and it would have been better just to eat the cost.
*it doesn't work that way*
&gt;Never said it did. Just that it can. Surely, you would be willing to be part of that experiment where you and some other volunteers send money to them, right?

&amp;#x200B;
That's exactly what I'm saying, we are already too deep for the cancellation of the program to make sense. I honestly think Ford is afraid that it could be a huge win for the previous Liberal government.

Conservatives don't want things to change, far too much (perceived) benefits for their pocket-books if they keep the lower-middle class suppressed.
*still doesn't work that way*
You realize the end goal of UBI is to reduce the social services tax burden right?
They did. Hey finland how did it go? Sucked and you cancelled it? Sweet.
&gt;You've described every experiment ever.
&gt;
&gt;Yes, we should lose all ambition to better our society, to play it safe and keep the status quo. 
&gt;
&gt;

Yup, free money is breaking away from the status quo. 

Everyone here is brilliant for thinking free money is possible. What was the result of agent orange tests? 

Government experiments are fun. Because who cares, it's the tax payers funding.
&gt;Lol this is the most mind numbing nonsense I've seen around here in a while.
&gt;
&gt;So we should just not research anything ever then I guess?

Ya the world's black and white.

Perhaps the government can spray agent orange on everyone.
You... You don't understand how any of this works, do you?

We pay our taxes, it goes in the budget. The budget earmarks x% to x and y research, UBI being one, and the money is allocated.

The outright benefit of actually performing the research and pioneering it allows us to ACTUALLY be in a place to set policy instead of being a tag along.

If you don't understand, just admit it otherwise you're just coming across as an uneducated, narrow minded, stereotypical neo-conservative.
Still never said it did. Just that it can. Surely, you would be willing to be part of that experiment where you and some other volunteers send money to them, right?

&amp;#x200B;
Which doesn't have to deal with the experiment itself and how it harms those taxpayers. They are not voluntary participants
*that nullifies the experiment by its nature*
\&gt; We pay our taxes, it goes in the budget. The budget earmarks x% to x and y research, UBI being one, and the money is allocated. 

And the more programs or experiments the less tax payers have.
Never said it did.  


\&gt; Based on a lot of comments so far, I am sure there are lots of people who would send their own money to fund research projects
That's not how it works. Canadian companies are given grants from the government all the time to develop technologies. These technologies are not shared.

&amp;#x200B;

For the research that it published, doing it in Canada with Canadian money means that our companies get to influence what research is performed so that it ends up being tailored to what they need to move forward.
Yes because running a financial pilot project on a small number of Ontarians designed to improve quality of life is *totally* the same as testing a substance designed for warfare on everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Sorry if I misinterpreted.
What? No. You still pay your taxes. What is spent where is irrelevant to your argument. That's like saying you're loosing money if your landlord earmarks x% of the money he collects to give to someone else.

Nowhere did UBI take anything away from taxpayers. You're either a troll or, if you truly believe what you're spouting, do not understand the basics of civic economics.
Social context is crucial. Sure it's great that some Scandinavian country managed to get some program running. And it's 100% useful but you never really know if it works here without doing experiments yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Not to mention the intangible benefits of being a research leader. If Canada is the first to truly and successfully test this, we pull the best researchers into Canada to do the research and benefit from their expertise. 

&amp;#x200B;

The best example (and a very valid example) is the cancellation of the Avro Arrow program. We laid off many of the best scientists and engineers  of their generation only to have many many of them leave for the States and work on the Apollo program.

&amp;#x200B;

Your view is shortsighted and damaging to our economy and future.
how
He's a troll, or an idiot, best to stop feeding him.
If you never respond to trolls only their ideas are presented in the comment section.  There is always a point where you should stop responding but I didn't feel like it was yet.  Probably won't respond anymore unless it feels like a thoughtful post.  

edit: mistakes
Replacing those programs with UBI is an enormous cut to the middle class.  Any UBI implementation is less than half of the EI max.  All those 'efficiencies' are service cuts.
&gt; If you polled the majority of people in Ontario (or Canada) they would be in favour of trying this out.

Not disagreeing, but source?
I agree
That's not a harm, they could be upset at spending but there is no harm
So I take it you are against government funded RnD in general then?
Germany too.  One guy even admitted that he used the money to party.
&gt; how to best spend those dollars (maybe less of them actually)

you mean how to spend *our* dollars.

it would have been more expensive regardless.
perfectly legitimate under the UBI scheme; if everyone gets it, there will be plenty of people who are doing well enough that they don't actually need it and it will for them become essentially play money.
At which point the marxists start whining about why the wealthy also get UBI and their agenda reaches it's magnum opus - taxes on those with to fund free money for those without.
Which is illogical since the whole premise is the opposite of what you're saying.
Not illogical at all. If it turns out no one is willing to partake in it then that itself is meaningful to the experiment
Listen pal, I don't know why you can't get this through your head, but there are a lot of things your tax dollars fund that you may not agree with. It's the same for everyone, but we operate as a society, and we all understand that taxation is necessary for a functioning nation with high quality of living. UBI is an alternative to social welfare, which you are currently paying for. If UBI is successful it would completely replace all other forms of welfare. That means you wouldn't have to pay any more taxes toward welfare than you already do now. It would just be a more efficient welfare system.

Also, your idea that other nations should do the research instead is pretty silly, and there are other pilot projects going in in several different places around the world already. But every nation has wildly different economies and mindsets towards welfare. A pilot project in Denmark won't provide very useful information than one done here in Canada.
&gt;Government experiments are fun. Because who cares, it's the tax payers funding. 

Nearly all research projects at every University in Canada are funded, at least in part, by the government. Should we stop doing science all together?
Not everything needs to be funded by tax payers. Ex this experiment. Welfare payments should also be optional. 

&gt;A pilot project in Denmark won't provide very useful information than one done here in Canada.

You can apply the same logic to canadian regionality along with time frame of the experiment making it meaningless
Yes and no. 

The 'yes' is purely in relation to your comment in EI, though you may want to not that this would be in comparison to the trial program only. There's nothing that would prevent adjustments to the program in future to account for temporary job loss.

The 'no' part is that they're is a ton of inefficiencies simply by having multiple programs with their own administration and staffing. Simply merging several programs to provide the same benefits in a different way is cost saving. 

To be clear, I'm not talking about reducing any amounts transferred to end recipients, just that the admin side would end up having massive savings.
My thoughts exactly.
&gt; help us understand how to best spend those dollars

Isn't the whole point for people to spend the money however they want?
Liberal Speak 101: Using democratically granted powers to enforce conservative policies
&gt;One guy
nah, see: LHC
The studies I saw all show that it would be extremely more beneficial overall. You may spend more here but you will save even more over there kind of thing. 
Google benefits of universal basic income if you are genuinely curious about this. An informed position is always better.
I meant to say how society should spend those tax dollars meant to support the least fortunate amongst us, not how they would individually spend their UBI.
People already do that though. Have you ever been through a low income area on 'cheque day'?
But society spends it in UBI handouts. They wont do anything other charitable spending
Handouts? Sir you’re obviously misinformed on the whole concept. 

As I said elsewhere, please look up the benefits of UBI online. Then think about ALL the social programs governments are funding and realize how many of them won’t be needed anymore. Then think of an ideal society would look like for you and decide how much you think we should spend on that.  You will have a much more informed opinion.
What?  Now I'm not sure you know what UBI is.  Hard to tell what you're saying in that paragraph though
[deleted]
In general Marxists don’t support UBI at all so what is their agenda exactly
That is to much free market thinking for most folks.
They didn't cancel it. It ended at its predetermined date and they just didn't extend it. They are analyzing the data now.

Wealthier people get less from UBI because they are in a higher tax bracket and pay most of it back.
&gt; Google benefits of universal basic income if you are genuinely curious about this. An informed position is always better.

There are benefits to giving people money.  What it all really costs in the end, and whether or not it is worth it is debatable.

Thankfully, there are still lots of minimum wage jobs available, and minimum wage pays almost as much as UBI would have.  So, able bodies people aren't screwed.

I'm in favor of giving disabled people and low income seniors more.  That is, people in hard financial straits.

I'd be more in favor of free University tuition for Canadians rather than a blanket UBI scheme.
&gt; and pay most of it back.

You wouldn't have gotten any if you made about 34k per annum or over.  You wouldn't pay it back because you'd never see a penny.
Then what's the problem? 

But capping who gets it like that pushes it further from UBI and closer to welfare. If I lose my job this year, I don't get the UBI until I file my next tax statement? UBI should go to all, and then anyone making over $X a year would essentially not be getting anything. Then we can reduce the need for other welfare systems like EI, public housing, permanent disability, old age security, etc.
I like that you want to look at the figures to make your mind. 

I’m in full support of free tuition in universities.
It costs too much.

Good luck scooping up things that people paid into like EI and CPP and giving it away.
Except it should be cheaper. Because there's a lot less management. The people who get money from this would be the same who get money from EI and CPP. Everyone should come out more or less the same. You're just taking back any money with a progressive tax to anyone who makes above the minimum.
Same management costs, maybe more (because of more people on it).

Because, the proposed UBI was just welfare for more people.  The systems still had to monitor who got it, and how much they were earning/working.  Just like we're doing right now.

Basic income in Ontario was never slated to replace EI and CPP; people are just making that part up.  But, keep in mind that EI and CPP just become an extra 'tax' to pay people UBI if that ever came about.  People are just lying when they say that EI and CPP would be included because it makes UBI look more affordable to gullible people that believe that all the years of Canadians EI and CPP contributions would go into the basic income pot.
Less people on it. Literally give it to everyone with managing who gets it. Remove EI, and welfare. Change the tax code to adapt to the new wages. Multiple agencies are removed, and the only increased burden is on the CRA to collect the taxes (and a few people to troubleshoot for people who fall through the cracks). Way less management. 

Basic income would replace almost all welfare. If you lose your job, you don't need EI because you're guaranteed an income. When you're retired and not making money, you don't need CPP because you're guaranteed an income. No one should be able to not afford to support themselves, so they will have housing and food, so we don't need public housing and food programs, because everyone is guaranteed an income.
That's not what the plan in Ontario was, though.
&gt;“Not only is the cancellation inconsistent with international best practices, but it violates your own Canadian policy for the ethical conduct of experiments involving humans,” warns Forget in the letter signed by more than 20 researchers and stakeholders participating in basic income initiatives around the world.

Some 20-something people signing their names to a letter of protest is hardly "global outrage."
Depends who the 20 researchers are.
&gt;around the world

How would you define "global"?
Global means of, relating to, or involving the entire world.

If there was truly global outrage about a single topic I would be surprised the whole world agreed to give a shit about something.Outrage from around the globe implies people FROM all over the whole rather than the entire world and would have been a better phrase to use.Basically the statement is hyperbole. So slightly click-baity.
Ontario should reply by sending an invoice to these 20 people. 

They want it so bad, let them pay for it
&gt;20 researchers and stakeholders participating in basic income initiatives around the world

So, pretty unbiased people.  /s
This.  No one cares globally other than people who make their living off studying basic income
this is a stupid idea that makes no sense whatsoever lol
People can have bias but also be correct.  The b-word seems to be thrown out with such vigor these days, everyone has bias my man.
Pfft.  Of course \*you\* would say that.
[removed]
I mean if they are researchers from around the globe, it fits the definition of global.
&gt;How would you define "global"?

People from both downtown Toronto and the GTA.
People who want something being the ones to pay for that thing they want is a stupid idea?

You're either a straight up Marxist or you didn't think your comment through very well.
&gt;it violates your own Canadian policy for the ethical conduct of experiments involving humans

and these people are researchers? I wouldn't be able to force myself to write this sentence in their shoes, at first I assumed it was some goofballs who didn't appreciate what a policy like that was meant for, but actual researchers bringing it up is straight embarrassing. they're trying to make it sound like Ontario is using experimental drugs on people.
&gt; Ontario should reply by sending an invoice to these 20 people.

Best idea yet.
meaning they could not find enough Canadians who cared, but their friends studying "basic income" world wide are worried other countries will quit giving away money.
These people who were part of this program had to make drastic changes in their lives. Move out from previous living situations to single dwelling homes as part of the conditions of this program which they currently can't afford. Leave current jobs to get training/education that was a condition of receiving basic income. A lot of these people are in a rock and a hard place because of the sudden pull out of this program. It is entirely unethical.
They aren't complaining because the government didn't want to pay, they're complaining because the government decided to pay, asked people to take risks, and then all of a sudden new guy comes in and tells the all to fuck off and deal with it
That's how government works. The shitty choices of the previous government are rolled back when they're kicked out.
Haha
they've got until march to re-situate themselves, way more time than I've ever been given to adjust after losing a source of income.
Ya. And they were mostly researchers who couldn't fund their own and wanted to use our data.
Let's hope they aren't on the hook for a lease agreement.
No, that's not how government works. When a deal is made, the new government rides it out and can replace or terminate it, however they usually honor the previous agreements.

This way of simply wiping the board is trump and ford's way, but that's not how it was before, and it shows how little you know about politics.

If every administration rolled back everything they disliked, we wouldn't go anywhere ever. Which is why trump and ford wont last. They aint doing shit except tearing down what was done by others
&gt;asked people to take risks,

LOL

Come on.
Well yeah, the goal of the program is to allow people to test things.

Many left their jobs, moved and enrolled in schools.

You may not understand that since you're probably not working yet, but those are major life decisions
You get it, but it was at  -1 points in a matter of minutes.  People gotta ease up.
:( I thought it was funny.
Not sure how you arrived at that "meaning", but that is not what global means.
Bitch?
Bias?
Basic Income?
So, all economists everywhere? They all want to k ow how such programs will work in the real world.
DOZENS OF US ^^^almost
&gt;Many left their jobs, moved and enrolled in schools.

So What?  That's completely separate from the program.  Nobody asked them to do anything but collect free money.  Anything they did outside of pulling that free money out of their bank accounts is completely on them.

&gt;You may not understand that since you're probably not working yet, but those are major life decisions

You would be wrong.

Maybe it's because I do work that I know there is no magical money tree.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Lmao you have no idea what you're talking about do you?

They specifically chose candidates to have them move out, enroll and take these kinds of decisions. that's the whole point of the fucking pilot. 

Now please, please inform yourself before pretending you know what you're talking about.
20 people. That's what we're talking about here.
You said no one globally cares. I guarantee you that more than 20 people world wide care about the basic income experiment that was happening in Ontario. 

A lot of economists were probably anticipating reading the results.
As was I. I'm not outraged and neither is the world. That's what's being discussed.
Even if it was 50 I would not call that global outrage.

Thats like calling a local car accident a global disaster.
Who says it's as low as 50?

Id imagine that all economists in the world want to see the results of a basic income study, and are disgusted that it was cancelled for ideological reasons.
Lots of people in this thread picking on the word "global" as hyperbole, as if that somehow invalidates everything else. If we want to mince words, I suppose "international" would be more accurate and less hyperbolic. Regardless, who cares? It was highly unethical to cancel the experiment in the way Ford did, they deserve all the criticism they get.
Can you show me where its more then 50?
&gt;They specifically chose candidates to have them move out, enroll and take these kinds of decisions. that's the whole point of the fucking pilot. 

&gt;Now please, please inform yourself before pretending you know what you're talking about.

I think you're a liar

www.ontario.ca/page/ontario-basic-income-pilot

You're the one that doesn't have a clue.  Nowhere does it suggest those things

They were chosen based on income..  regardless of employment status.  Nowhere was anybody asked to enroll in school or quit their jobs.  

None of what you said is true


Now please, please inform yourself before pretending you know what you're talking about.


Why u gotta insult me?   Suggesting I'm a jobless idiot.   I'm right, you're wrong.
Lmao read that page again
Why don't you show me

You're done dude...

If I'm a jobless moron because you thought I didn't know what I was talking about...  but it turns out you're the one full of it...  even after I posted the policy

What does that make you?
I'm sooooo done. 

Makes me someone who's capable of reading better than you lol.

They reduce you UBI if you work. That's actively encouraging people to go back to school for re-education.

It's not a novel concept. Same thing as scholarships.
I'm still waiting for you to show me

&gt;They reduce you UBI if you work. That's actively encouraging people to go back to school for re-education.


No it isn't.   From welfare to cpp to unemployment insurance...  if you have income you get less. 

&gt;actively encouraging people to go back to school for re-education.

LOL


You said they were asked to quit their jobs and go to school...  you said that's how they were chosen....  and called me a jobless moron because I disagreed.


SHOW ME.

I'm calling you out as a liar

You downvoting me cause I hurt your feels?
I'm still waiting  for you to show me.

Just admit I'm right

You were really quick to respond to me until the truth punched you in the face
I'm not going to screenshot the passage for you, it's in the page YOU linked me after all.

Can't show you anything if you turn a blind eye
You won't because you can't.

You're a liar..  your the one that needs to learn to understand what you read, you're the one that needs to get educated.  

You call me a jobless moron?   Well i win.

Guess what That makes you?

Lolololololl
Well, i didn't call you a jobless moron, i said you probably aren't a worker, because you don't seem to understand the implications of depending on a job.

The fact that you seem to be so happy because you "won" makes me even more confident about you being young and immature.

Then again. Maybe i'm entirely wrong. Maybe you're just old and immature.
Oooh no...you absolutely suggested I didn't have a job

And you absolutely suggest I was too stupid to know what this program wad
Such as the basic income astroturfers on reddit.
That, i might have suggested indeed.
Oh you certainly did...

Then I proved you're a liar... that none of what you claimed was true.
You really do have nothing better than to argue with strangers, good night man, i'm out. Shame me, i've fed a troll today
No troll.


I posted a link to the official government program.

All you need to do is show me. .  And I'll admit you are right, I was wrong and that I'm a jobless moron that doesn't know what I'm talking about... all of the things you said I was...  yup, I'll admit it.


But I'm not wrong.. am I?   So What does that make you?

I made it so easy for you... you claimed the program was one way.... I said it was another....  I posted a direct link to the entire program...  and you name called, lied, and insulted until you said it was your bed time.



Too proud to admit you lied.

did you mean alt-right astro turfers? 

because that's all anyone can see here for miles
How are you this dense lol. Basic income is a massively popular idea in acadamia. Huge number of proponents and a huge number of people that think it's a dumb idea. I can guarantee you 25+% of universities in the western world have at least 1 prof in their econ department that was aware of this project and was eager to see results. Do you know how rare even somewhat decent attempts at a basic income trial are?
You’re an idiot. A pedantic alt-right idiot.

His position is resonable and tenable. You probably believe in a magical sky fairy too but don’t require proof of that...
Sorry but your a weak small minded pathetic individual. 

All I asked for was evidence for a claim and you went into full fear, insecurity and 2 year labelling. If being rational and asking for evidence makes people alt right then I guess you must hate every engineer, scientist and reasonable person on the planet.

I don't give a shit and left or right in this case I just want evidence. If you can't provide it you have no argument, you have a political talking point. So that makes you a fucking political extremist, the worst type of human garbage from my point of view.

You are what you hate, you should do something about that. You have more in common with the "alt right" extremists then anyone else on this entire thread.
Even if a handful of professors in a few countries where unhappy I don't think any rational person would call that global outrage.

Putin killing people in other countries causes global outrage. Most people outside of Canada don't even know about this.
Do alt-righters post the constant stream of basic income articles here?
what constant stream?
Western World is like 40 countries, hardly a few. Multiply that by the average number of universities by country and you get 1000s of people. "Global outrage" is a bit of a hyperbole, yeah, but you're downplaying in the other direction...
You’re
This is a global problem, and a lot of the worlds eyes were on this study.

I know it's hard for a lot of people here to believe, but there are actually people in this world thinking further ahead then what's for dinner tonight or which minority you want to blame next for the economy crumbling because of automation.
Wow I never thought I'd see one of these in the wild. Have fun starving to death for your red hammer &amp; sickle in 50 years.
Do you even understand what communism is compared to BUI? 

In case your fear mongering news sources forgot to educate you, communism tried (and failed) to enforce a standardized income for its citizens. BUI, only guarantees that everyone WILL have an income, there's no saying you can't still become a millionaire with your stellar education.

So your hyberbolic idiotic comment about starving is backwards, BUI is what's going to save people from starvation when the world is even further automated.
The world's eyes were on Finland's "UBI" experiment - and they canned it. Go study that.

Germany tried it, and canceled it. Go study that.

Spain is about to try it in Barcelona. Go study that.

Scotland is about to try a version of if. Go study that.

Most of the Western developed nations/economies want no part of it. Go study that.
And yet Canada has one of the best examples of UBI: Mincome.
Great. Go study it.
Done a long time ago.
Yes, it was, and it was good of little Dauphin, MB to try it.

I'm not being glib - there are studies, and some pending studies that we can all watch. None to date have shown it to be a success (certainly on a broad scale), and so the reluctance upon local taxpayers to engage in Ontario's (deeply flawed) study are understandable.
The most promising things to note were the decreased hospital visits because of less sickness, better mental health and less workplace incidents. Grades increased and overall working hours increased.
We might get much the same result from flex shifts, job-sharing, remote-commuting to work, and reduced hours with increased productivity.

I am not being glib when I write "study it"; there are studies, and the Ontario one was deeply flawed (the sample set was skewed to those participants who wanted it, and to those who through the application process had shown some ability to successfully self-administer it).

The problem is in applying one standard, broad and generalized "solution" (free money handouts) to what are in fact very specific life-problems (i.e. not everyone is in poverty for the same reasons). Just giving them money results in them incorporating it into their baseline economic framework, and ultimately it just raises the market costs of living (i.e. prices/consumer price index rises over time to absorb all that free money - leading to recipients demanding more money in order to rise above the new "poverty" line).

Lots of problems with the study, lots of problems with the idea, lots of problems with the outcomes, lots of problems in government controlling it, and lots of problems with the issue of who - or what - is supposed to pay for it all.

So just keep studying it ...
Finland didn’t cancel their UBI experiment. The duration of the trial was to run until the end of 2018, and that’s when it’s ending. 

The government will determine if they proceed with expanding and extending the project once data analysis has been done on phase 1. 

Many headlines run about the Finnish government *not extending* the program were misleadingly written as *cancelling* the trial. 

The Barcelona version has been running almost as long as the Finnish one (started 9 months after the trial in Finland in Oct of 2017) 

Your information sources seem... slightly off.
I understand that there's issues with UBI. Here's a few:

1) Politicians will eventually try to get votes by promising increases to UBI, and it would be political suicide to promise to make cuts to it.

2) The cost of living is not equal and can never be equal. Therefore, either UBI will have just as much overhead due to complexity as what it aims to replace, or UBI will be useless in urban areas.

3) To get the maximum amount of savings, the income taxing system needs simplification as well, updating SIN or maybe even creating a Bank of Canada. All government related funds go to and from there.

Just the setting up of the foundation will have a significant initial cost which will hurt the chances of adoption.
I for one, am happy that this was cancelled
Most were. The only ones that seem to lament its passing are the ones that were anticipating lining up for the handouts.
In all of my decades of life as a Canadian, the only line up for a handout I have ever seen was of homeless people and Ford supporters waiting to shake their Rob Ford's hand.
And on that basis these are the people that you want to give free money to?
The homeless? yup.
Then here's an idea. You go ahead and fix poverty by giving them your money (because the homeless are well known for being some of the best at handling free money handouts), and leave the rest of us hardworking taxpayers out of it.
[deleted]
Lol. 

Enough with this age old Conservative talking point that colors this idea that the government is handing out cash in envelopes. It's tired.

Homeless, as in without home or shelter. As in basic human necessity. Unless of course you haven't a trace of basic human decency. 

The beauty of a democracy is that because I also pay my taxes, I also get to help decide who gets what.

Looks like more Canadians are choosing the basic human decency route.
The Ontario study did not even include homeless in it...
Which is a shame. 

I thought we were having a slightly higher level conversation. 

"Working poor" is a very real, and many people fall into that category. They are not addicts, criminals nor are they a drain to society.

They work shitty jobs, for shitty pay. Otherwise known as cleaners, cashier's and gas station attendants (to name a few)

They need help.

Summary:
That's not how it works.
What is the benefit for Canadians to be the ones to do the experiment?
The people who get money from this would be the same who get money from EI and CPP.
I don't make enough to fund experiments on my own but that's why governments do research projects like this .
There are benefits to giving people money.
No, that's not how government works.
If no, then they are harmed.
You still pay your taxes.
You... You don't understand how any of this works, do you?
That's what we're talking about here.
And the more programs or experiments the less tax payers have.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
\&gt; Canceling this experiment will harm Canadians letting it continue would not.
They reduce you UBI if you work.
No one cares globally other than people who make their living off studying basic income.
You said no one globally cares.
&gt; 

Every experiment any government conducts uses tax-payer money.
So What does that make you?
Tax payers who do not want to be part of this are harmed.
&gt; and pay most of it back.
Most of our research is government funded.
Basic income would replace almost all welfare.
I said it was another....
If you lose your job, you don't need EI because you're guaranteed an income.
&gt;What is the benefit for Canadians to be the ones to do the experiment?
I'm not you're just not reading my words I think.
*it doesn't work that way*
So we should just not research anything ever then I guess?
Why do you think it harms Canadians if the experiment continued?
And on that basis these are the people that you want to give free money to?
That can be avoided by letting others do the experiment and seeing the results.
Do you know anything about experiments?
They don't need to concern themselves with the experiment!
The solution has to come out of taxes because there is no other way for it to work.
*still doesn't work that way*
But I'm not wrong.. am I?
I for one, am happy that this was cancelled.
Guess what That makes you?
Even if it was 50 I would not call that global outrage.
It is objectively better to let another nation do the experiment and see their results.
tax payers have less disposable income, forced to give money to other people they do not want to.
Now I'm not sure you know what UBI is.
Canada has funded research for a long time.
Surely, you would be willing to be part of that experiment where you and some other volunteers send money to them, right?
Then if you don't agree with it why are you saying not to talk about it harming tax payers?
If other countries are bothered, they can pay for their own experiments.
That will likely just be nationalization of industries and a UBI.
I understand that there's issues with UBI.
I guarantee you that more than 20 people world wide care about the basic income experiment that was happening in Ontario.
So you already agree with that then, it harms canadians.
Almost all research projects in every university in Canada are funded, at least in part, by the government.
It needs to be researched, perhaps it's the type of program that could actually save money.
You won't because you can't.
there's a difference when talking about **what is** and **what should** be going on.
Still never said it did.
Basic income in Ontario was never slated to replace EI and CPP; people are just making that part up.
People already do that though.
UBI should go to all, and then anyone making over $X a year would essentially not be getting anything.
I like that you want to look at the figures to make your mind.
Most people outside of Canada don't even know about this.
What I said is still correct.
&gt;Nobody is harmed through this experiment

Many people are potentially harmed in this experiment.
The same could be said about the UBI pilot: it might not work the same here as elsewhere.
