This needs to be a sub
/r/oopswrongaccount
Subbed, bummer that it‚Äôs not more active though.
Its a social experiment
Holy fuck, seriously? I just wrote down what I thought would be a good name for a sub like that.. didn‚Äôt know it existed. I hope you get something out of it.
Relevant: ["The Predictable Threads are Driving Me Insane"](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/77d9ou/the_predictable_threads_are_driving_me_insane/)
That was such an adventure
r/oopsdidntmeanto
You're a social experiment!
No u
Tl;dr: Reddit has common patterns, if you spend too much time here, you'll notice and potentially go off the deep end like u/rooster_86.
What the frick
u/rooster_86
Close, yet far...

edit-fixed, thanks.

My Lord, that's one helluva rabbit hole I fell into there
Care to explain? Or am I missing something?
[deleted]
That's some grade-A karma whoring!
This guy gets it. lol
You ruined the joke.
[removed]
Holy shit
They know, they‚Äôre just saying it‚Äôs predictable
Oh boy I remember that one. I actually didn't realize it was the same guy until I had read quite a few comments.
Ultimate karma machine, make three posts, gets 3 times the likes. Genius.
Wow this is up there with the [I bet I could eat 100 treadmills thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6nz1k/got_six_weeks_try_the_hundred_push_ups_training/)
lol thank you, I didn't know that one yet :D
Jesus I'm in tears. That's hilarious. Some reddit threads are hiding some funny ass comedians.
Omg took me way too long to look at the username and get the joke.   I was looking at all the responses thinking, what the hell are they talking about!?   Off my game today.
I have a very detailed calendar for this
Twice??
I'm really lost and please excuse my idiocy, but I've gone through that linked thread and really failed to see what was either funny, absurd or memorable in it. Would you please be kind and explain it to me? Sorry again if I'm missing something the size of a planet.
Its both forward *and* backward looking
Wasn‚Äôt there a redditor would took over a post and pretty much RPed themself for a bazillion upvotes and gold?
/r/nothingeverhappens
Twice
Ah it's a decade old now, I guess you really had to be there.
Fair enough but I beg you, could you tell which comment was funny and why?
Best Kpop group, hands down.
This sub makes me feel really bad like the people who do this are on some r/2meirl4meirl type shit.
Watcher's top level comment, unsolicited advice was way over the top but then the community joins in and takes the absolute piss.

This is a decade ago.

Facebook was very different then, Instagram and Snapchat didn't even exist. This kind of back and forth was nigh unheard of outside of digg.
Schizophrenic folks can be beautiful models, too. Don‚Äôt hate.
I know this is a joke but I think you might be confusing schizophrenia with dissociative identity disorder.
Schizophrenia is not multiple personalities
Are you saying schizophrenics can‚Äôt be beautiful models? Stop hating!
You might have schizophrenia tho...
Hmmmmm.
Only a schizophrenic would say that.
I‚Äôm pretty sure that means they just called you beautiful. I agree.
schizo here. can confirm.
Have DID, can confirm.
Not a schizo but also took a psych 101 class, can also confirm
[deleted]
Can you read minds?
Not a schizo but also took a psych 101 class but also took a biological bases of behavior class but also took an intro to neuroscience class but also took an abnormal psych class, can also confirm
Is this a casting couch situation?

Cause he may be about to fuck himself.
He likes to roleplay with himself. It keeps the spark alive.

Risky click of the day
I just saw a man with his dick in his own asshole...
[removed]
omg why???!!!
Oh my. I'm glad I read further before clicking.
[deleted]
Nope, not clicking this one.

Is this technically incest? Because you're fucking yourself and you're a direct member of your family
Real questions are being asked right here.
Good god that is disgusting. Take your damn upvote.
You‚Äôre an evil man for exposing me to this , the pinnacle of perversion
I don't know...based on how many times in my life people have told me to go fuck myself, maybe the guy is fulfilling a request.
Curiosity got the better of me on that one.
I wish I had üò¢

OwO 

What‚Äôs this?
Thanks, I hate it.
I just saw a man asking for tips on -how- to stick his dick in his own asshole...
Dude what the fuck
·ïï( ·êõ )·ïó
And we just keep onnnnn scrollin'.
I think it‚Äôs more of just masturbation if we‚Äôre technically speaking. Like it‚Äôs argued that if you fuck your clone it‚Äôs not gay. It‚Äôs just masturbation. From a technical standpoint it‚Äôs sound. But at the end of the day you‚Äôre still fuckin a dude.
MaStUrBaTiOn Is GaY iNcEsT
Idk you might regret missing out on some astounding penile flexibility
Yep..
[removed]
I don't really see how it's any different from masturbation. *shrug*
Jesus Christ, that got me good. Wasn‚Äôt expecting that.
Me too.. If you find a good therapist, let me know.
Hahahahahaha
Wait. . . But. . . .how. . . .wtf
What if your clone was genetically altered to develop as a female?
It would differ in genetic code so technically it‚Äôs be a whole new person. It‚Äôs straight fam lol
Did... anyone answer?
Instantly makes me they of old cartoons where the vac cleaner sucks itself and disappears.
/r/eybleach may help.
it's been 6 hours....stop browsing it.
Eh. I mean, it's a bit weird, but at least it's consenting human adults who aren't hurting themselves or anyone else. That puts it above a few other perversions I can think of.
It's quite easy to do it - I succeeded on my 2nd attempt. You just have to find the correct direction to rotate your penis (either left or right) until your ballsack and penis have changed positions.

Then the most difficult part, sticking it in your asshole. Most people fail and give up here.

NOTE: it's hard to maintain an erection at that phase too.
Dear god in heaven...
If you fuck a clone of yourself, is it gay, incest, or masturbation?
seconded, that's staying blue
Me too bro. Me too.
I will pray for you. Also, gay.
Well, technically if you masturbate with your hand, you‚Äôre fondling a guy‚Äôs penis, too.
Scrollin'... Scrollin'...

Thank you for saving me from that
If you mean jacking it on the couch, then yes. Yes it is.

Okay I can see how you'd forget to switch accounts to make one reply, but how do you make this whole conversation and not realize you haven't switched accounts once?
[deleted]
Likely on two different phones thinking each is a different account.
That is really stupid.
Haha you are right!

Great comment.
OMG thank you so much!
Ooof
WTF
Haha this exchange, I believe was humorous
what in the fuck
Silly muffin :-)
Also likely fake. Take your pick
This made me laugh. Thanks for your service. Mister.
Or maybe he was being sarcastic like "see, people? It's not that hard!"

American Apparel. Of course. 
I worked for them years ago. People in the stores were all pretty cool. Anyone ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù was a shitstain or a scumbag.
I mean if you worked there when Dov was there then yeah, but it wasn‚Äôt all bad.
You got that right :)
Holy fuck, you know Dov?
Same, 10 years ago in DT Toronto. Shoplifting central before they got the security tags. I‚Äôm pretty sure Dov said people who stole the clothes deserved them.
I'm so happy I deserve these zip hoodies that don't fit anymore.
who the fuck is Dov
Yeah, I read that guy who owns the company is a fucking scumbag. This cringey shit doesn't surprise me.
Former founder of American Apparel. 

We went to the same hs
How the hell is he a scumbag??
Anyone who worked there during that time did! I'm not sure exactly what you mean though.
i don‚Äôt think you can be the former founder. just founder.
Nah some other dude founded it now

Summary:
who the fuck is Dov.
I don't really see how it's any different from masturbation.
Holy fuck, you know Dov?
I will pray for you.
If you fuck a clone of yourself, is it gay, incest, or masturbation?
If you mean jacking it on the couch, then yes.
Or am I missing something?
