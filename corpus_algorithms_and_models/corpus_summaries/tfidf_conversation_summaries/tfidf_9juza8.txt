Original Response:
Since about Mid-August I (female, 34) have had the hots for a co-worker (male, 40) in a completely different department. Our departments don’t interact at all. We have a very large, open-concept office and we sit very near each other. I always smile brightly to him and he gives me a flirty half smile when we pass each other in the hall. And I occasionally catch him looking at me throughout the day then he quickly turns away. This past week he has been following me into the break room and we have had a few short conversations about work loads and the weekend.   

How can I find more ways to talk to him since our departments don’t overlap at all?  How can I tell if he shares my light, flirty affections?

Update: I found out he has been divorced for 2 years. Obviously it was the first bit of info I sought, hence wanting to find ways to talk to him. I am not “defective” either; I was engaged and he committed suicide 7 years ago. I took time to heal and get in a healthy place before dating again so I’m barely starting to enjoy flirting again. 


TL;DR: I like a cute coworker but can’t figure out how to interact with him because we work in unrelated departments.

Don't poop where you eat.

Things will most likely not end well.

Yeah, I keep seeing comments like this on here and it just shows how young most posters are. Once you get into your thirties, it's incredibly hard to meet new people, and work is one of the few opportunities you get to spend lots of time with other people who may also be single. I'd rather take the risk of it not working out and having to leave the job than missing out on a potentially amazing relationship because I put the job first.
I'm torn on this issue. You're right, it is hard to meet new people after 30. Friends-of-friends and dating sites/apps are your best bets and the apps get pretty tiresome, and your friends-of-friends come with their own awkwardness. I met my current SO on the job, but I got lucky - he left the company so I could date him as a former co-worker, not a current one. 

But I do always caution people. I think about all the breakups, all the ways in which people reveal themselves to be bad for you, and how terrible it would be to have to face that kind of ex in the workplace, or leave a job you like because of such a breakup. Not to mention the things shitty co-workers or bosses may say about the relationship, or bring your personal business into your work life despite you keeping it strictly professional within the work place. I think the policy of "don't shit where you eat" has a lot of merit because of all the things you don't know when you get into a relationship. Maybe your cute co-worker is an amazing partner who  you can spend the rest of your life with, or maybe they're a horrid stalker who misrepresents you to your boss or undermines your work effort once they become an ex. You can roll the dice, with no idea what the outcome ends up being. It's a risk you take in any relationship but usually that doesn't impact your work life. I guess it all depends on what your situation is and what truly is a risk worth taking.
&gt;eah, I keep seeing comments like this on here and it just shows how  young most posters are. Once you get into your thirties, it's incredibly  hard to meet new people,

No, it's not. Tinder, okcupid, bumbler and many other ways for people to meet each other other than meeting people in the workplace. That's an awful idea, to become romantically involved with someone who works in the same workplace, then what happens when the relationship ends?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'd rather take the risk of it not working out and having to leave the  job than missing out on a potentially amazing relationship because I put  the job first.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd rather not lose the roof above my head.

&amp;#x200B;

And this guy is like 40, he's probably married. If not, and if he was never married, it's because there are reasons for that...
Well, she might as well dig her own dating grave too then since she’s in her mid-30s

Dating apps are toxic for a lot of people. What happens to those who don't want to use them? Being single forever? Most people can change jobs if they absolutely have to. You sound like you are very young and assume finding a partner will be easy. As a 30-something woman, a lot of my friend group is already married with kids. Work is one of the few places I'm spending time on a regular basis with other people, seeing what they're like as people, how they interact with others, basically seeing them without the 'mask' people put on for online dating. I would absolutely not rule out dating someone from work when it is in fact one of the best chances I have of finding a relationship. 

Again, you sound young, immature and judgemental. What is your arbitrary cut-off age for someone to not be married and to not be defective, in your eyes? You think it's better for people to go ahead and marry people they're not sure about rather than hold out and wait for the right person? Yeah, OK.
I think this is a cultural thing. Most of the people I see advising people not to date coworkers are American. It's far more normal in Britain. Maybe because we don't rely on our jobs to provide healthcare. I leave jobs all the time for many reasons, and just go get another one. I barely know anyone who has been in the same job more than 2-3 years. My job is not my life, and generally leaving a job is not a big deal for me. I would way rather take the risk than not.

How are dating apps toxic for a lot of people? How come?  People seem to be doing fine with okcupid, plenty of fish and so on, at least I never heard anyone complaining about dating app, and I know plenty of people who met their significant others from dating apps.

&gt;What happens to those who don't want to use them? Being single forever?

They can meet potential partners organically? Like people have been doing in the western nations for the past 50 years or so?  Nightclubs, bars, wine events, music festivals, concerts, and by hanging out with their friends and getting introduced to people who are single?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

yeah, but there are jobs and then there are good jobs. With the state of the economy? I live in Greece, it's not like jobs abound for guys who happen to have them in the first place, you know?  I have a friend of mine who has been working in the same restaurant for the past 10 years.

He makes good money all things considered , he has good work schedules.. and he's the only guy who isn't 50 and he's surrounded by girls who work there in the kitchen as cooks, as waiters, at the receptionist desk, and although he finds them to be attractive and he's single - he would never dare flirt with any of them, and when they flirt with him he shuts that down quickly.

€€€€€  are far more important than the guy having a romantic relationship.

&gt;You sound like you are very young and assume finding a partner will be  easy. As a 30-something woman, a lot of my friend group is already  married with kids.

&amp;#x200B;

And as a 28 year old man, I have a lot of friends who are already married and with kids, but I still always manage to come across women who are single. Usually younger women. Have you ever considered dating younger men?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Again, you sound young, immature and  judgemental. What is your arbitrary cut-off age for someone to not be  married and to not be defective, in your eyes? You think it's better for  people to go ahead and marry people they're not sure about rather than  hold out and wait for the right person? Yeah, OK.

Depends. If the guy is average-looking but has decent social skills, the guy being mid 30s and never having lived with a woman/never married is going to make me raise an eyebrow. An attractive man with a good job, his own house, no college debt and no criminal record in his mid 30s to 40s who is still single?

That is going to make me think that the guy is either in the closet,  he has a low sex drive, he has really high standards in women,  he either has a long string of broken relationships, or he only has a couple of relationships in his past and spent most of his life in one night stands and friendships with benefits, seriously, not a good potential relationship/marriage partner there.

The only guys I know through my father who is older than the age of 50 and still single and never married are the guys you wouldn't want to introduce to your parents. Although they are handsome, they're still very immature and don't want commitment and only want to have fun with women.

&amp;#x200B;

If a woman is in her early to late 40s and she's not married, she's never been married, and she's single: I assume it's because almost half of the men over the age of 40 suffer from erectile dysfunction, are emotionally broken from past crappy relationships, are broke from paying child-support, or are physically or mentally or emotionally ill in some way or another, or have criminal records.
Because they are. It's unnatural to swipe through photos of potential partners, which do not provide any insight on how the person smells, acts, interacts with others, etc. Things you can pick up on very quickly in 'real life'. Plus a lot of people on dating apps have a kid in a sweet shop mentality and are simply never satisfied. The first 'flaw' they see and they're back on the apps, looking for perfection. Not to mention that the majority of men I've ever met from such apps are out for casual sex, and will pretend otherwise until they get it. I personally find them toxic and a waste of time. 

Meet people organically? For many people in their thirties, that means going out alone, which is hardly ideal as a woman, for safety matters, if nothing else. I'm not going to go out on my own as a woman to a nightclub or a bar, get real. My entire point is that it becomes extremely difficult to meet people through friends if all your friends are coupled up and only hang out with other couples. 

Go for younger men? Are you really kidding me? One of the major problems for single women past the age of about 28 is that older men tend to go for younger women, but the other way around isn't as common. How many men in their mid twenties do you think are ready to settle down and have kids, which is what I'm looking for before I'm too old? Most single guys my own age still act like overgrown kids and would rather play videogames and hang out with their friends than start a family, so why do you think younger guys would be more open to serious commitment?

I really don't think you have any kind of an understanding of what it's like to be over 30 and single, especially for a woman. My opportunities to meet new people are extremely limited. Most of the people I meet in social settings are already attached and as I said, I don't like apps, so I'm not going to turn down the opportunity to meet someone great just in case it doesn't work out. Like many people, I don't need to worry too much about leaving a job. I have a good skillset, work in the tech industry and am fluent in several languages, with lots of experience living abroad. I could move to another country next week and be totally fine with it.
