Original Response:
&gt; Nestle, owner of more than 2000 brands in 189 countries, has told a senate committee that Australia's proposed mandatory reporting requirements could add "cost and time" to businesses and suppliers "which will need to be borne somewhere".

Surely a company of this size could produce these reports without putting a dent in its profits. But apparently not:

&gt; "While we are of the view that the mandatory requirements are sensible, in practical terms this
difference means that multinational companies will have to prepare bespoke statements for
each country in which they are required to report," Nestle's submission said.

Got something to hide, Nestle?
Yeah, we can't fight slavery because it'll cost money.

What a crap company. As if that's a small negligible detail in their supply chains not worth looking at.

They have proven many times that they will always put profit over human lives.

They aggressively market their milk formula as a healthy alternative to breast feeding in 3rd world countries, in full knowledge that this leads to babies dying because there is not enough clean drinking water.

They invented their own fair trade label for their Nespresso pods, so they don't have to offer actual fair trade coffee.

Out of all companies in the world, I'd be least surprised if Nestle has slaves somewhere in their supply chains and won't do anything about it until they are forced to.

And I'm not surprised at all that they are actually fighting this law.
Putting the pitchforks down for a second, have they said anything that's not correct?
Just because it's correct, it doesn't mean it's right.

They basically said we don't want to do anything about slavery, because it will cost money.

100% correct, but also 100% crappy.
It's reminiscent of the Ford Pinto issues in the US in the 1960s. Ford knew there would be x many deaths from the car in rear engine collisions, and were happy to just pay people out. US govt said yeah, nah cunt, fix your car. Some things are more important than money or profit.
What a crock of absolute shit. "Bespoke" reports my arse. If you gather the data to the highest standard you are required to report, you are fucking done. Its not like none of the countries requirements will overlap.

How many more employees could really be required here. You would have sociology doctors fucking lining up around the block to have a crack at this.

They aren't worried about having to do the work to report it, they are scared shitless about doing the work to change the nasty shit the reports uncover.
&gt; Yeah, we can't fight slavery because it'll cost **you the customer** money.

They aren't even crying poor over it, the threat is make us do something to not be evil and it will cost YOU money.
That's a pretty crappy excuse, because they are trying to make it sound like they would like to do that, but they can't, because they want to put customers first. It's not like customers would notice if the price of KitKat goes up by half a cent.

But despite that, I highly doubt that a company with 127 billion AUD revenue doesn't have the money to find out whether they are using slaves.

Chances are they are worried that they find it that they are in fact using slaves and that won't look good on them.

yes they said 
&gt;  mandatory requirements are sensible

then said how it was not  sensible. 

they cannot be right about both.
Um...no? Read the next paragraph:

&gt;Nestle in 2015 acknowledged serious issues with slavery in its supply chain after commissioning global non-profit Verite to investigate six production sites in Thailand. Verite found vulnerable workers from Cambodia and Mynamar had been lured to Thailand, often under false pretences, and forced to work in dangerous and violent conditions.

&gt;Nestle has also acknowledged issues with child labour in its cocoa supply chain and spoken strongly against the practice. On July 1 it implemented a new responsible sourcing standard with mandatory requirements of suppliers relating to pay rates, working hours and workers' ages.
So it should be easy to report on, right?
&gt;Surely a company of this size could produce these reports without putting a dent in its profits.

Do you even live in the real world?

Every effort costs money. Putting together these kinds of reports for things like chocolate and cobalt means someone has to keep track of every supplier all the way down the chain to original resource extraction.

Nestle has nothing to hide, they are simply stating in their submission that this kind of reporting will cost money. it would be better if they could give an indication of how much it will cost. People making a fuss over reporting costing money are the actual villains of the piece here, trying to attribute malice to companies when no such malice exists.

&amp;#x200B;
&gt;If you gather the data to the highest standard you are required to report, you are fucking done.

Not even close.

One country will want reports based on dollars per hour, pro rata for the hours worked. Another will want reports based on equivalent pay, converting the money and hours by some mechanism intended to allow for "apples" to apples comparison of labour in different countries. Another will want a humanitarian report, with no consideration to hours worked or salary equivalence.

To gather the data to the highest standard, you're really saying to spend an enormous amount of effort gathering data to satisfy one nation's reporting which is never even considered by another's.

Someone has to pay for that effort. The money has to come from somewhere, and the corporation producing the report really only has one source of money and that's their customers.

The real question is how much extra it will cost for a Milky Way to have the provenance of that confection accurately reported. Will a $2 sweet now cost $5, or $2.05?
They said nothing of the sort.

What they said was, reporting on provenance costs money, so be prepared for the cost of Nestle products to go up in order to raise the funds to produce these reports.
No, they said mandatory requirements are sensible, but the work to satisfy the mandatory requirements costs money.

It's a no-brainer, they're just stating the obvious. But then this is a government hell bent on subsidising white elephant coal plants because they want their party sponsors to be able to turn a profit running a coal mine.

&gt; "While we are of the view that the mandatory requirements are sensible, in practical terms this

each country in which they are required to report," Nestle's submission said.

Clearly they're angling for standardized reporting across countries. That's not evil. At least not transparently. It could be a delaying tactic. Reaching such an agreement would take time.
...no?

Look I think they should do it. Nestle is such a fucking amoral company that they should absolutely be made to report on the potential issues with modern slavery in their production lines.

But I see their point. They're a multinational company and they're going to end up preparing individual reports for many of the countries they do business in, as more and more countries inact these laws. In the interest of trade and business it may be beneficial for countries to work together on a collective document that standardises the requirements of these reports to improve the efficiency of slavery reporting.
This has been the Imperialist, colonialist and now fascist argument all along. This is why the Labour, Union, Workers rights movement exist. And change was fought with blood. Never forget that.

Modern Alt-right, Libertarian deplorables are just the latest in a long line of power-collaboraters against their own class.
Not sure why this is downvoted but this is entirely realistic.
I'd be surprised if Nestle *didn't* have slaves somewhere in their supply chain to be honest.
Or, they could just make slightly less profit than they currently do.
I mean they're clearly trying to get out of doing it, or get it watered down. It's not incorrect to say it will incur a cost for them to report, but it's a scare attempt. The correct answer though on our behalf as consumers though is to say "OK" and not be phased. If we care about having products not made by slaves, then we must care enough to pay for that.

This is a country where people simultaneously get excited about buying $1/L milk, while demanding that the Government do more to support farmers.

&amp;#x200B;
Gasp! Rodger, darling, there is a communist on my Reddit. Come shoot it for me.
Because it's still bullshit.

Generating that sort of report is bread and butter for any large company. It would be a once-off effort for a very small group of people, then part of routine not long after. 

They'd already be producing far more comprehensive reports every time they changed the thermal control system of one of their tempering machines.
&gt;in practical terms this difference means that multinational companies will have to prepare bespoke statements for each country in which they are required to report,

Well then come to the party Nestle and help develop a global standard reporting system that achieves the desired outcomes of each country
Spot on. They deal with chocolate, there's no way their hand a clean of slavery.
Yeah, nothing makes me more suspicious of a company having slaves than said company protesting against having to report that stuff.
How about they stop profiting from evil?
This is the sort of info any large company already has on record.  One the size of nestle would have a goddamn division dedicated to it
In a country like Australia it’d be really easy, where farms are several hundred thousand acres and your guy can go and look at a few payslips etc. 

Go to rural Thailand or somewhere where’s there’s a new field with a new owner every few hundred metres and any labour used are some locals that you paid in cash to help you for the day or a promise to help them when their harvest is ready... Auditing that would be a nightmare. I think it’s worth paying a bit more to ensure we aren’t enabling slavery, but I wouldn’t call it ‘easy’.
of course Nestle is malicious, like all large companies. if your reason de entre is profit, than naturally you will pursue that to the detriment of everything else. theres no such thing as an large ethical company, its an oxymoron.
AKA, we not gonna do it
