Original Response:
Was listening to the news today, and I found myself getting angrier and angrier. As well all know, Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of sexually assaulting a minor (15) when he was 17. The entire discussion was basically we shouldn't hold people responsible for the actions performed when you're a drunk teenager.

Why the fuck not?

Let's be clear about a few things. This isn't new data. She came forward 6 years ago. She also stated that she was in fear for her life. For years, she has had to live with that. The psychological damage that can cause alone is a lifelong problem.

I can't help but be reminded about convicted rapist Brock Turner and his father's "20 minutes of action". The excuse of time passing or being technically under 18 is not valid for assault. I was raped at 19. I'm 27 now. Eight years has not undone the damage of being violated. Ten more years won't undo it.

Stop excusing rapists and sexual assault perpetrators.

Edit: I would love to thank the Trump bros, the #notallmen, and the pedophile defenders from coming out. Unfortunately, these comments are so much that I cannot dedicate anymore time to explaining how rape and assault is unacceptable no matter the age.
I absolutely agree.  To argue that Kavanaugh's **alleged** actions are excusable, is to tell all 15 year old girls that they might get assaulted by an older boy but it isn't the boy's fault.  Imagine your 15 year old daughter was just assaulted.  Would you look her in the eye and say, "boys will be boys"? 

EDIT - added "alleged", as I was quite reasonably corrected on that point.
&gt;Would you look her in the eye and say, "boys will be boys"?

This is exactly what a policewoman said to me when I was grabbed off the street and sexually assaulted by 4 men while walking home from the supermarket.  Two blocked my path, one held me down and one groped me, tried to digitally penetrate me and then did something that left his DNA all over my clothes.  The policewoman dealing with the case told me, "It sounds like lads being lads."
As a lad myself, I'm appalled.  That's a horrible thing to say, and it makes me frustrated that if i had behaved like that as a kid, that it would be shrugged off, maybe even expected of me because of my gender.

People ARE arguing such actions are excusable. 

And you find someone guilty (or not) by investigating, collecting what evidence there is, and then making a judgement. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" is the measure for US juries, one doesn't have to prove it that completely in other contexts (like the court of public opinion). Arguably a higher standard, and therefore a lower burden of proof, would be called for before appointing someone to a lifetime position as a judge on the US Supreme Court.

I've heard she was 15, he was 17 -- what do you mean she can't recall the year?

&gt; What evidence? That‚Äôs the problem here, there is no evidence. She can‚Äôt even remember what year the accusation occurred.

There IS evidence. Her testimony is evidence. Is there more evidence? We don't KNOW yet.

&gt; That‚Äôs why the FBI already reviewed the accusation and determined it to be unsubstantiated.

If this is true, I'm sure they'll say so and it will be a short blip in the confirmation process. Meanwhile, I'll wait for them to say so.

At a specific time someone asked me, I would have to stop and do the math on exactly what year I turned 15. That doesn't mean I can't remember it. You made it sound like she couldn't remember when it happened; now it sounds like you mean she couldn't do the math, in her head, immediately on being asked.

Look, I don't know whether this is true. You don't either. It's significant, its timing is suspicious though explainable, I am saying it should be investigated.

If you have specifics on the FBI review you mention and can cite a source, I'd be interested in that.

Can't have an ironic username these days without dumbass sexual-assault loving Trumpets getting upset lmaoo
Don't you love a dude who literally bragged about sexually assaulting women?

Not to mention walking in on underaged girls in their changing room.

If she knows how old she was, that means she knows when it happened.
I am not even american nor do I like Trump...but I see you have no logic ü§∑
Than why can she not provide a year.  

If it‚Äôs being investigated are they supposed to ask witnesses what they were doing when the accuser was 15 years old??
They can add 15 to her birth year. Ta-da.
And that‚Äôs still just a best guess.  Point being she can‚Äôt even recall the date along with anything else to corroborate the accusation.  Who‚Äôs house, who‚Äôs party, who else was there?  None of this can be provided.  Not to mention she was admittedly drinking so that too hampers a recollection of what really happened.
&gt; "It sounds like lads being lads."

Just locker room banter. With fingers and DNA.
\&gt; Kavanaugh's actions 

&amp;#x200B;

Alleged actions. The issue with the claim that it happened during high school isn't that he was young and he should be excused. The issue is that the allegations are from 30 years ago with no evidence and so conveniently and politically timed that there is a substantial motivation for his accuser to lie and the accusations deserves healthy scrutiny.
Someone in the original thread said something like

‚Äú... and he might not have known about consent or that it was wrong.‚Äù

It was such a weird excuse to write. If someone doesn‚Äôt understand consent, that‚Äôs more of a reason for them to be in jail. It‚Äôs not some excuse that means you can just roam society at large, harming random women because gosh darn, you just didn‚Äôt understand that holding someone down while they try to get away is wrong. I mean wtf.

These excuses are just insane.

I wonder if she really believed that or if she was just another lazy arse pig who didn't want to do her job.
It's not like he was a controversy-free candidate in the first place and the political opposition was looking desperate to dig up a reason to contest him. They had plenty. Why fake a scandal on top of all that and risk tainting the rest by association?
Him getting through was all but guaranteed up until know.  Yeah in theory a couple of Republican senators *might* have held him up, but they were all signalling very strongly that they wouldn't.

Now this happens and there's a real (though still not great) chance that it will scuttle his whole nomination.

I still am heavily inclined to believe the woman (rape has one of the lowest false reporting rates of all crimes), but if you were willing to compromise your ethics for politics (and we all know that people willing to do this do exist) then making up a fake rape story *could* be something you'd do to tank Kavanaugh.
A statement by a witness IS evidence.
She disclosed to her therapist years ago and the therapist has since verified that.
‚ÄúInnocent til proven guilty‚Äù is for criminal trials, not SCOTUS confirmation hearings.
[deleted]
She disclosed *somebody* tried to rape her years ago. I suppose that could be construed as evidence that a crime took place, but that in now way shape or form implicates kavanaugh.
I see a news headline, possibly from a story that broke after you posted 5 hours ago, saying that they're going to hold hearings on the sexual assault allegations. This will, at least, hold up the confirmation.

You're wrong about everything else you said, too.
she didn't actually give a legal affadavit, so its technically not evidence yet, but you're right that if she makes a statement it's considered evidence. 

If he gives an affadavit categorically denying it, that's also evidence. so it's just he said she said. 

regardless, my point is that she has a substantial motivation to lie. Much more than the everyday victim of assault because of the political outcomes associated with this case. it's more to do with that than age.

Kavanaugh was nominated to be a federal district court judge and confirmed by the Senate. Then he was nominated to be a DC Circuit judge and was confirmed by the Senate. These allegations didn't come up then, during those confirmations. Sure, not as high profile and not SCOTUS, but federal judges have life terms and are in very prestigious and powerful positions, especially on the circuits. Why is this suddenly an issue, an allegation, NOW? Is it less of an issue that an alleged rapist (or alleged almost rapist) is a district court or circuit court judge than a SCOTUS justice? I am suspicious of the timing here.

I do not make it a thing to not believe alleged victims but I do get suspicious sometimes of the timing of allegations like these. She may well be telling the truth but these points I made go to her credibility.
He is legally a child. Children have dubious morals, hence the existence of laws such as this. Most teenagers have a clear sense of right and wrong but you have no idea what this kid has possibly gone through as a child. Most people continue developing their morals throughout their life, because it is the only way to develop them at all. I think by 17 most people would understand right and wrong but he was under the influence as well. Why should we send him to jail? Seems to me he was failed by his parents and teachers. Unfortunately the dude is a victim here too but this sub would never admit it. I'm not excusing the young guy for his actions but could you possibly imagine what would cause someone to rape? Consent is the worst excuse tho, gotta agree with you that is a silly excuse. Probably just trolling on break from the Donald. Just saying it is very likely there is more to the story than what we know.
This is seriously underestimating the intelligence of 17-year-olds - even drunk ones.
I am 18, meaning I legally am an adult, but I could just as well still be 17, and I know what 17-year-olds are like. Sure, they might not be entirely mature yet (I know that definitely isn't the case for me), but they sure as hell should understand that rape isn't okay, even when under the influence. You don't have to be explicitly told by someone how wrong it is to get it unless you have some kind of mental deficiency - especially not at that age. Other teenagers with less than great upbringings get drunk without raping people. How is this somehow different?
totally agree.

I don't think we should be spewing propaganda like "believe all women". Nor does "innocent until proven guilty" apply in public opinion like it does with criminal proceedings. 

"take allegations seriously and investigate with healthy skepticism" is the way we should treat these issues. 

humans sometimes lie. women are humans. therefore women sometimes lie

it's as simple as that.
Fuck her
And Kavanaugh was being touted as a possible supreme court nominee for Romney even back then, and for a while it was thought that Romney might win. Here's evidence for Kavanaugh already being thought of as a potential nominee in 2012:

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/03/26/holding-court
that's interesting. circumstantial still but it adds some plausibility compared to my previous assessment of the situation.
There was a witness to the alleged sexual assault and he said it didn't happen. 

The biggest problem with these allegations are:

1- On what date did this sexual assault happen, and at approximately what time? 

2- What was the location of the alleged sexual assault?

1 and 2 Ford has no answer to. 

Additionally, we have statements by the accuser, the accused, and a witness. The accused and the witness categorically deny anything happened. 

What else can an accused person say to an alleged event with no date time and location?
I‚Äôm glad to hear her speak out. She has both a personal and political right to let people know about her experience. Her personal right is to some sort of resolution and justice for the harm she‚Äôs suffered. She has a right to this, we all do. Even if the law has no recourse for it, we always have the right to try to receive some form of closure. 
Her political right is to participate in the welfare of the state. The state should make decisions based on complete information. Sexual Assault is always relevant
(I‚Äôm a guy following this sub to keep me empathetic and open minded. Hope you all don‚Äôt mind)
[deleted]
Of course it is politically motivated! She is motivated to not have her abuser become politically powerful! And she is a citizen with an interest in the welfare of her country! (Her ‚Äúpolis‚Äù if we remember where that word came from) That seems legitimate to me. As far as her process, I‚Äôm not going to judge her for choosing to call a senator before a policeman or vice versa. 
The right to due process will come from the FBI regarding any crimes he may have committed, with appropriate criminal consequences (we hope) but justice for her and for our political institutions will come from her telling the public and those who need to judge his suitability to be on the Supreme Court.

A 'not guilty' verdict does not mean the allegation is 'proven false'. What an entirely naive and simplistic understanding of the justice system. 

It means there wasn't enough evidence to prove behind reasonable doubt. That means the crime could very well have taken place - there just wasn't enough to prosecute. Just as a 'guilty' verdict doesn't necessarily mean the crime happened - it's much rarer due the bar for proof being so high, but innocent people can and do get guilty convictions based on the available evidence.
[deleted]
It is all we have which is why it's best to try understand it as accurately as possible and avoid any misleading statements about 'not guilty' (and even 'unreported') translating to a 'false allegation'. 

Plus, what we have could be improved with time and effort :)
[deleted]
Sigh...I'm not going to go in circles about this.

You posted this:

&gt;I believe that she has a moral obligation to report the offense to the police and have it properly investigated and **proven to be false or have merit**

That's a very false dichotomy and not the same as arguing simple 'semantics'. I wasn't personally sharing my views on Kavanaugh although you're very right that we probably agree. I was correcting what was an unfortunately common misunderstanding or misleading statements about how the justice system works. 

Particularly when it concerns sex crimes which are inherently much harder to convict based on their circumstances, it's extremely important to remember not guilty =/= false allegation (where unfortunately the assumption of the allegation being false is much greater than in other crimes despite the actual rate being the same as those other crimes). The alleged victim is also covered by innocent until proven guilty therefore should not be assumed to be lying even if the result is 'not guilty' (which would be committing slander/defamation and perjury).
[deleted]
Because you can have a true allegation that doesn't hold any merit because there isn't enough evidence - or even any evidence. In fact, what evidence is there might contradict them (eg: person A sends texts being excited about sex that evening with person B to person B. A gets there and is nervous, wants to leave and says no. B then rapes A. No other witnesses, it's somewhere private with no recordings). That doesn't mean it was 'false'. Person A would still be telling the truth, however they cannot prove beyond resonable doubt that rape happened. Neither can B prove beyond reasonable doubt that A has made a false allegation as A may have revoked consent during the act, but there isn't enough to say either way. Regarding the media, people are allowed to have opinions without a court telling them what to think. Press-wise they have restrictions on what they can and can't say - if they go too far, they will be sued.

Best of luck to you too though in your future endeavours :)
This is a lifetime appointment of a very select 9 people out of 325 million. Your whole life is on trial, including when you were 17. We already have a sexual assaulter on the court, don‚Äôt need a second.

I was arrested at 19 for simple assault for punching a guy who was beating the bag out of a 16 year old kid.  It disqualified me from a job at 27.  I think the Supreme Court should be held to even higher standards.
[deleted]
&gt; We already have a sexual assaulter on the court, don‚Äôt need a second.

In all seriousness, what past crimes could a Supreme Court Justice wind up credibly accused to have committed in their past that would disqualify them from their position, at least until after an investigation is completed? 

Like if it came out that a Supreme Court Justice was a murderer, would that be sufficient to justify their impeachment and removal from the bench? So why would being guilty of sexual assault not affect their position?
You know Clarence was an allegation too right? Never proven. Obviously that doesnt mean he didnt do it, but how can you say we already have one sexual assaulter on court? It was an allegation. Are you one of these people that thinks that **ALLEGATIONS** should ruin somebody? have you never been accused of anything you havent done?

And no, you shouldn't be held to a lower standard than the supreme Court, and they shouldn't be held to a higher standard than you. Everybody should be held to the same standard.
Being guilty are the keywords.
&gt; sufficient to justify their impeachment and removal from the bench

There is no line of sufficiency for impeachment, all that is required is for a Super Majority of the House and Senate to vote against you, it doesn't actually make a difference what it was for. There is no legal distinction. Now the severity of your actions performed could determine if they WILL vote against you, but there are no guarantees. Even if you did kill someone and only 65 senators for yes for removal, you still keep your job.
Thomas? Sorry, the reason I disbelieved that (I know I'll be downvoted) is - where are the others? A guy who's willing to try to gross out and embarass and blatantly harrass a smart, high-profile legal professor type is not going to leave a plethora of legal secretaries, ordinary secretaries, and other women alone. He should have left a trail bigger than Wienstein's. There should have been a dozen or two ready to talk...
Unfortunately you will be downvoted, but yeah. Agreed. There was a lot more that didn't add up, which obviously led to him being voted in. Sure does seem like the same type of thing happening now.
There were other women,  Angela Wright and Rose Jourdain, who made statements supporting Hill‚Äôs allegations. However, neither were called to testify at the hearings.
&gt; We already have a sexual assaulter on the court, don‚Äôt need a second.

Thomas was accused of harassment, never assault.

Summary:
so it's just he said she said.
She has a right to this, we all do.
There was a witness to the alleged sexual assault and he said it didn't happen.
I am suspicious of the timing here.
That doesn't mean I can't remember it.
That doesn't mean it was 'false'.
Obviously that doesnt mean he didnt do it, but how can you say we already have one sexual assaulter on court?
A 'not guilty' verdict does not mean the allegation is 'proven false'.
I was raped at 19.
I think the Supreme Court should be held to even higher standards.
Just saying it is very likely there is more to the story than what we know.

I think by 17 most people would understand right and wrong but he was under the influence as well.
