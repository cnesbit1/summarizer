Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Was thinking about the TJ/TAM beef the other day whilst watching TJ and Duane on JRE, and remember TJ saying something about McGregor after the whole 'snake in the grass' fiasco. So...

Who wins: TJ or McGregor at 145?
McGregor. Just the pure size of him, plus TJ got rocked bad against Cody in the first fight, I'm presuming a punch from Conor is even worse. This is all hypothetical though as I think McGregor would struggle to make the weight now.
Conor does. Much bigger man and at least an equal striker.
McGregor is just far too big for TJ. I struggle to see an outcome in TJs favour. Even if we’re talking Conor from when he was fighting at 145, he was still a big boy for that division and cut a massive amount whereas TJ is a small Bantamweight as it is.
Of course of course, I'm a BIG fan of TJ and was thinking that his skillset may overwhelm Conor but, considering how good Conor is at reading movement and maintaining distance, it may prove to be worthless.
TJ has a much wider skillset though, size is definitely the biggest factor ofcourse.
Yeah TJ said he walks around at like 150 and goes into fight week at 140 which is crazy. Conor walks around in the 170s right?
Yeah TJ was initially a wrestler so he always has that to rely on too.
I love TJ but I think he would struggle with a few of the top featherweights like McGregor, Holloway and Ortega just because of the size. TJ is a big Flyweight, average Bantamweight and small Featherweight. His incredible skillset is what enables him to be the best at 135. Maybe once Ortega and Holloway inevitably move up to 155 we could get a triple champ in TJ though?!
It's so weird how big the difference is between TJ and Holloway/Ortega. They're some big fookin bois.

TJ Cejudo will be interesting, Cejudo is a BIG flyweight too.
I think McGregor weighing in at 202 was a good indication of Conor at his biggest. 168 with no cut.
Yea I’m pretty sure that’s right. I’d say TJ has a much wider range of skills but Conor’s striking is insanely precise and the size difference would just be too much.

Summary:
McGregor is just far too big for TJ.
TJ is a big Flyweight, average Bantamweight and small Featherweight.
TJ Cejudo will be interesting, Cejudo is a BIG flyweight too.
