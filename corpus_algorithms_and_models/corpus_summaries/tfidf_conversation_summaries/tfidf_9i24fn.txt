It may become the nation with the most Christians, but it will not be the world's most Christian nation.
Which nations are on your shortlist, for the sake of discussion?
VATICAN CITY FTW
Poland is a shoo-in.
yeah, people are converting DESPITE the government trying to stamp it out. So really depends on how you define Christian nation

All of Latin America

You may underestimate the power of the Lord our God.
I completely disagree with Latin America.

Does he have an interest in specifically making china the most Christian nation?
He may have a purpose in doing so yes. Do I know if he’s going to? No... but my point is he’s capable.
Yeah, but the comment said that it wasn't going to happen, not that it couldn't happen.

Insanity in a sentence.  Latin America bleeds for Christ.  It permeates every level of every culture, even often indigenous ones.

Summary:
It may become the nation with the most Christians, but it will not be the world's most Christian nation.
I completely disagree with Latin America.
