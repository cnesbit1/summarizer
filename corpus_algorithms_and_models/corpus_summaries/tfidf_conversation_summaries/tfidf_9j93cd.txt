It's annoying to have clean sheets and they immediately get dirty after I cum inside girlfriend and it leaks out big time.  Any advice?
Wipe what you can up with a towel or tissue, then just let the wet spot dry and sleep in it
This is what I've been doing lately, but was wondering if there was a better solution.
Get a mattress protector. You can out it over the sheets. You can buy the same size of your mattress. They are waterproof, and wasable. Look for them on Amazon
I have a mattress protector under the fitted sheet.
Why not put it over the sheets?
Dunno, that just seems odd; never heard of that before.
Less things to wash
Other than laying a towel down beforehand I donâ€™t see what else could be done. Tell her to clench really hard, or to cup herself right when you pull out.
hahaha I swear I've thought to tell her to hold it in but that doesn't seem right.
Cupping is always an option, they even do it in porn
Slip-n-sliiide
Which is clearly always reasonable reality
Cupping your hand over your vagina to avoid a mess is unreasonable? Lol oh
Expecting it to work well is silly. Also wouldn't really want it on my hand, any more than he wants it on his sheets

Summary:
You can out it over the sheets.
