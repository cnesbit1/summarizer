Original Response:
We created an original story inspired by the works of Tom Clancy for this new Jack Ryan.  It’s a prequel of sorts to the existing books and films.  In our story Jack Ryan is four years into his career as a CIA analyst working in the terrorist arms and finance division when suddenly he finds himself thrown into the field for the first time to help down a terrorist who may possibly be the next Osama bin Laden.  We’re really proud of the show and excited to answer your questions!
You can stream Season 1 now on [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073RQ7KP4/ref=o_disp_wbpiv_soc_20160356)

Is John Krasinski really as nice as he seems? Every time I see an interview he seems like the coolest person ever. Just wanting that confirmation.
I hear he eats babies.
He'd also like you to believe he's not a baby eater. But he's never gone on record saying he isn't. Maybe he's too busy eating babies.
John Krasinski was in the closet eating babies and I saw one of the babies and the baby looked at me.
Following in Lincoln's footsteps
The baby looked at you?

Sarah, get Super Nintendo chalmers on the phone!
Sick reference, I haven’t thought about that in forever

This thread just keeps on givin!
Waiting for link to spaghetti video.
I mean, you can at least assume he’s like that in all his professional work, and I don’t think anybody really knows how he is on his own time, except for him, his family, and his friends.
