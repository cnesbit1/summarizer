Wanna hear something gross? I peeled a giant scab off my knuckles and ate it.
Honestly, not even surprised. I've seen some weird shit at the tank
no thank you
did it taste like boogers imo scabs weirdly sometimes do
what the fuck
Reminded me more of like cooked breading
It's 2 AM on the West Coast and 5 AM on the East Coast. Not many people are gonna see this lol
The fuck kind of breading have you been eating
Better question: What's up with my scabs
Both good questions!
they got flour in em i guess
