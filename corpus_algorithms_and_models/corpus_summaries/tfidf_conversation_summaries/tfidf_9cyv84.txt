It’s human nature. We aren’t biologically engineered to be sexually monogamous. Read Sex at Dawn by Cacilda Jetha and Christopher Ryan. Very interesting, well researched book infused with humor.
Second this! That book is a good read!
Do you feel as though it's more than just biological engineering though? I've just been wondering like is it possible that a relationship-state preference (monogamy, polygamy) is just as programmed/"genetic" maybe as sexual preference (hetersexual, bisexual, homosexual)

Since for "biological-got-to-prolong-the-species" engineered nature, bisexuality and homosexuality have no purpose for it right?

Just food for thought really, not trying to offend anyone ofc!
I’m guessing it’s hard for something like nature to create 100% heterosexuality, especially with males and females looking so similar in other species. Also the genitals aren’t decided right at conception, but 50/50 penis/vagina, until a combo of nature/nurture tells it which one to prefer.
Just because we aren't biologically engineered to do something doesn't make it advantageous.

Someone got a link the post that shuts down the whole genitals/nipples thing? It's about how they form, not when they are decided on. Gender is genetic, it's decided when the cells start to form.
penis/vagina is determined 100% by the combination of sex chromosomes an individual has.  There are certainly more combinations beyond XY, YY, XXY but genitalia is 100%nature/0% nurture
I’ll definitely read this.
Holy shit that was dumb.

Summary:
We aren’t biologically engineered to be sexually monogamous.
It's about how they form, not when they are decided on.
