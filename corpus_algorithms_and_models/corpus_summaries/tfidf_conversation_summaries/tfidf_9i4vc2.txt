Yet people will buy blindly because it's Apple.
I bought apple music for a couple months. Its like spotify but missing some artists and no ads. The only real reason to use it is because its so integrated with siri. But that's really the only reason to use it over spotify. 

I've stopped buying iPhones
Spotify works with Google and Alexa
Try me.
ofcourse because apple is apple, it has reputation with its name
That was the major selling point for me.
Spotify also has no ads if you get the premium service, which is the exact price of Apple music.
If you have the Apple Watch it’s worth the switch to Apple Music since you can’t get offline songs on there from Spotify
That sucks. I can load up my Samsung watch with offline Spotify tunes like crazy right before I hit the gym.

I am guessing that's an Apple way to force you into the Apple Music ecosystem?
I’m not sure if it’s Apple forcing it or Spotify not making a good watch app. I wouldn’t be surprised if Apple just didn’t let them so they didn’t care about making a good watch app.
Its apple not letting spotify integrate to force you into buying their apple music.
Well it worked lol. Once you find the playlist that autoupdates it’s not that bad of a switch.
Buy even if you do that, you can't integrate it into your apple watch nor can you integrate it into siri
Apple Music becomes a nightmare when it tries to force your entire library into the cloud and now you must use data to listen to music.

Summary:
I’m not sure if it’s Apple forcing it or Spotify not making a good watch app.
Its apple not letting spotify integrate to force you into buying their apple music.
