I assume you're straight and still hang out with men. If I'm right, then you're not attracted to men, but you still enjoy spending time with them and recognize that many of them are interesting people who are valuable in a miriad of ways that have nothing to do with how you feel about their sexual attractiveness. How is this different from hanging out with women you're not attracted to?

Maybe you are bi (assuming you identified as straight) and are sexually attracted to both men and women. Then you might be confusing wanting sexual intimacy with someone (and hanging around them for that reason), with friendship and enjoying socializing without that sexual/romantic attraction.

It's okay to not be social. I just hope you don't get sour because you don't hang out with people and only want sexual relationships, which are harder to form than friendships. Especially when you don't put yourself in social situations where you can meet others. 

Also red flag if someone you date has no friends or doesn't want friends. It means they will rely on you for all their social interactions. That's a lot to put on someone else. So most people tend to avoid that.

Then stop wasting their time if you see them as less because you can't wank off to them. And tell people upfront the only reason you are hanging out with them is because you are sexual aroused by them. Give them the choice to not be friends with someone who unless you can get off to them doesn't give a shit about them. Because that's what you are saying.

Oh so you already joined inceldom. 

Look. We both know your not sexual attracted to me. And I am bored of you. You are definitely someone i don't want to chat to. You are way to superfical and stupid. So this is my last message to you. - If you don't want to hang around people don't. Don't waste their time and yours. It's not that hard to say "I don't want to be friends".
