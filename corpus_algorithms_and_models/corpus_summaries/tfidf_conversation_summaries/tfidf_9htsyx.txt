Original Response:
I don’t know...he chose a background for the text and everything 😂
But his profile photo is sideways, leading me to believe he doesn't know wtf he's doing.

This one's a real toss-up.
Oh, good catch! It’s either he doesn’t know what the fuck he is doing or he is as weird as he is inappropriate.
My profile picture is sideways too and I can't find how to flip it back. It appears straight and Facebook just flip it without asking.
Navigate to the photo you want to flip, click options in the bottom right of the photo. Rotate left and right are the 4th and 5th options down respectively.
Seriously how do you facebook so badly? Like, you have to really try to fuck it up this badly. My 60 year old mother who never had a smartphone in her life didn't fuck anything up this badly.

This is a real special case worthy of study.
are you fucking 60 years old
When I edit it, its straight. I click done and it turns it.
Try edit it sideways?
I think I need to open it on PC and not mobile to fix it.
I don't post much on FB but mine used to auto-assign a background if I posted not very much text.
It's a r/cringepics and r/oldpeoplefacebook crossover
A guy I went to high school with just recently did this to a girl I also went to high school with. Same background and everything except his just said “do porn”

I would bet they’ve never even spoken
I’m on Facebook quite a bit and haven’t had that happen yet. Maybe it has to do with it being in mobile or desktop?
I don’t see why they think that is okay!
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
&gt;This one's a real tosser.

FTFY
pink for a hint of romance and love ofcourse. 



show bobs and vagene plz
&gt;as weird as he is inappropriate

this needs an oddly specific adjective...
Doesn't look like it does it now, but definitely it auto-assigned backgrounds on the desktop, maybe when backgrounds were just released
I think the adjective is ‘perverse’
It did it just then for me in testing...

When I used tinder I would put my picture sideways so maybe it would make me seem more interesting and weird so they know what they’re getting into.
I believe you are correct. Sounds better than what I wrote.
I think I used to do that during my “rawr XD” days.  Because oh mi gawd so random.
To be fair if I thought that happened in private messages I'd be decorating the shit out of them
Any time my FB has done that on mobile, I needed to update something. App, software, something. So, maybe that?
Just turn the screen sideways!
Did you take it  on a iphone? Open the image in paint rotate and reupload
Lmao that's funny... It just gives me vertigo tbh 😂
I must be friends with you because I saw this on my news feed about 20 minutes ago, don't remember who you are though. That old bearded dude is creepy as hell.

Ahh OK. I don't think we have actually ever met, but we have like 80-some mutual friends because disc golf haha.
Now now, that's how you end up on cringepics :)
That's disc golf life haha
How does one get into disc golf life? I've played at a camp once but I've never seen an area devoted to it since
For sure! It's most of the reason I still use Facebook.
There is probably some courses near you. You can look on google maps for courses or facebook groups for leagues around you.
... bersome
You guys should go on a disc golf date.
Pretty much every town has at least one course. Just Google your town and disc golf course after and you'll probably find directions to one.
Now kiss
Brave using your real name. Because so many people are going to look you up now
https://www.pdga.com/course-directory

look for some courses around you, can buy discs online for super cheap too. you dont need a whole setup, played years in high school with only a long range driver.
You probably have courses near you and don't even realize it.
...berbatch
I would like to have 8 friends or maybe just one, can I play disk golf?
Wtf random
To this world
OSU is gonna crush Tulane tomorrow
Omg fellow disc golfers in the wild.
My Facebook profile is public anyway, so whatevs.
What is disc golf?
Go to [this](https://www.dgcoursereview.com/) website and search your area to see nearby courses. For buying discs, if you don't have a local store with a good selection (as most people don't), check out infinitediscs.com or discgolfcenter.com. Unless you want to do a bit of research into what discs you should start with, I'd recommend picking up a starter pack from one of the various brands. They'll all get you going in the right direction and you'll be able to build from there. My personal recommendation would be the [Dynamic Discs prime disc golf set](http://www.discgolfcenter.com/main_displayProduct.php?p=944). I didn't buy this set, but I throw two of the discs from that set, the Escape and the Truth. Also, check out /r/discgolf.  

End rant.
Found the guy asking for innapropiate pics.
Weed
You think someone could shove that disc up their happy hole(s)?

Wow $22 is way less than I thought to get into this hobby. There seems to be two courses somewhat near my city so I'll see if I can give it a shot
I checked post too.

She is "hot damn".
Weed is a gateway drug to things like disc golf and hackeysacking and jam bands

[deleted]
Lol disc golf or magic the gathering, lol samsies.
Weird; I did a lot of hackeysacking as a teen while not doing any weed, now I'm an adult jam-band denier that is high AF.
Do it! Great low cost hobby. Lost of courses are free to play or under 10 bucks. Great way to get outside and TONS of fun.
I live to Frolf!
Isabella asking the real questions
Google
Jam bands are real bruh
Pretty much every single Idaho state park has a disc golf course.  If you live in Idaho, check them out.
You can't prove it. Phish is a phalse phlag.
Eh, I never want to do anything except lay around after smoking.

Summary:
That's disc golf life haha.
