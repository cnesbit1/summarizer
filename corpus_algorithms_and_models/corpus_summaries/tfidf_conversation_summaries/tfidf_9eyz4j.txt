Original Response:
Debate question: Islamic God is omnibenevolent do you agree or disagree any why.

My position: I disagree; I don’t see Omni benevolent anywhere in the Quran or any of 99 attributes ascribed to the Islamic God. The Omni benevolent definition doesn’t seem to fit Islamic God. Islamic God is loving, but not all loving. The Islamic God has many attribute and is not lock down to any singular attribute. 

Edit Note: Please be respectful.
