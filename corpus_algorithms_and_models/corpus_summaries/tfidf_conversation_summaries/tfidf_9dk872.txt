So 60% of their cap can go to 4 players?

It did technically work, just not anymore
I mean the cap is gonna be 80m (close enough). Even Paying all four players 10 mil, that wouldn't equal 60%.

Most likely,
11 mil Tavares
11 mil Matthews
6.5 mil Nylander
7 mil Marner
Total of 35.5 Million or 44%

I see that as the most likely, give or take a handful of millions.
It never really worked, the year Toews and Kane's contract extensions kicked in was the year the Hawks fell off a cliff.
Only a handful.
Not exactly, it was the third year of their contracts where we completely fell off
I mean I'd call a couple first-round exits, including a sweep, following a Cup win falling off but at this point we're just splitting hairs lol.
You had to pay them for the success they brought you.
I don't disagree but that doesn't make the cap situation any more manageable.
Except Toronto is having to pay for the success they could bring. I'd rather be in Chicago's position.
I mean easy to say that now, but I'd rather have won 3 cups in the last decade. I am super excited about this year for the leafs (forgot I had Vegas flair lol cost me a bottle of scotch they lost the finals)

Summary:
I mean the cap is gonna be 80m (close enough).
