Original Response:
Alright guys. 

Here is a PSA and obligatory “not today” note all wrapped up into one. This happened on Sunday, and I’m still suffering. 

TL;DR at the end

Also this is on mobile, so if it looks like ass, that’s why. Sorry.

Anyways, Sunday night my friend, we will call him Greg, texted me. He said he’s paranoid and super drunk, and this guy is walking around his house with a rifle. 
I offer to come to his house and take care of him. 
We agree. 
I was already hanging with my coworker, we’ll call him Kyle, and Kyle is a nice dude, so he agreed to come with me. 
We drive over there. 

Greg is sitting on his living room floor, laughing hysterically at how cute his dogs are, the gun is propped by the door, and loud rap music is playing. Looks like he’s been having a grand ole time. 

We’re all just ducking around, a bunch of 20 something’s, and Greg shows the bottle of cheap liquor he’s been sipping on for the last couple days. Just some 100 proof Vodka. 

He offers me a sip, and I’m like “Sure, one shot can’t hurt.”

*boy, was I fucking wrong.*

In three hours, I have consumed about 8-10 shots worth of vodka. I’m not exactly sure how much, in all honesty, because I just started chugging from the bottle at the end. 

I’m fully clothed in a jacuzzi full of bubbles, wearing Greg’s motorcycle helmet ( Pic Included here: https://i.imgur.com/80zq9Jv.jpg ).

This is at 9:11 P.M.

Here is where the fuck-up becomes evident. 

So, I take Prozac and Elavil. 

For those of you who don’t know (much like my blissfully unaware self at that time) you are **not supposed to mix alcohol and antidepressants.** 

My medicine and the alcohol met in my bloodstream, and rather than being friends they decided to duke it the fuck out with brass knuckles and all. 

I’m laughing and I fall out of the jacuzzi. Ouch, that hurt.

So I’m crawling on the floor, white girl wasted and covered in bubbles. And here is where everything starts going in and out. 

I remember Kyle was holding me on the floor asking if I was okay.

I’m nodding my head yes, and then my leg starts shaking. It quits for a minute, and then the other one is twitching, and I’m laying on my side and i feel this *gut wrenching pull in my muscles.* I’m jerked into the fetal position, then my spine seems to decide it doesn’t like that, and I’m snapped the other way, my back arching as sharply as it could possibly be, and my arms are jerked backwards. 
I’m convulsing on my friend’s concrete floor, and then I vomit and stop shaking for a minute. 

I don’t know how long this continues. I’m fading in and out. 

Kyle is holding my head off the ground and telling me to look at him, Greg is in stunned silence, staring at me as I’m covered in my own stomach contents, and I begin to start the strange contortionist-like dance that is my body jerking itself in every way possible. 

I remember trying to crawl to the shower, as Kyle told me he needed to get the puke out of my hair. 
I’m laying on the stonework floor of the shower, hot water raining down on me. Someone picking chunks of Taco Bell out of my hair. Everything smells like bile, vodka, and the 5 tacos I’d eaten earlier that day. 

My body twitches, and I’m like “oh shit here it comes” and I’m fucking snapping back and forth, smashing my head, legs, arms, and any appendages I can against the wall of the shower, the shower bench, and anything within my vicinity. I vomit some more. I stop. The water is warm. It doesn’t hurt for a minute. I black out. 

I’m on the floor, and now I’m covered in towels, and Kyle tells me I ripped off my shirt shortly after the shower ended. I’m then wrapped in more towels so I’m not just swinging titty around like a damn carousel, and then I’m carried to Greg’s bed where I proceed to vomit in a trash can and pass out. 

Several hours later I wake up. 

I shakily put my dry clothes back on, look at the time. 

It’s 5 a.m. 


I have to be at Calculus by 8.


“Well shit.”


Spend the next hour grabbing my stuff and shaking Kyle awake to see if he’ll drive us home. 


I get home by 7:20, take a shower to hopefully rinse off the ungodly scent that has implanted itself into my very being. I get to class at 8:30 still faintly smelling of vomit. 


I’m still drunk. I go through all of my classes, still drunk. Physics was definitely interesting. 


I go to work, and **that** is when my hangover decides to hit. 

I’m fucking feverish, I feel like I’m gonna puke, I’m fucking*covered* in bruises, customers are asking stupid questions, and I wrote a bitchy passive aggressive note to my supervisor about how I’m sick of her shit. 

Now she and I have the same shift today, and it’s time to see if I get demoted or just lose my job altogether. 

TL;DR

I drank in excess, and blacked out, had seizures from my meds mixing with it. Go to work hungover. Might lose my job. 


EDIT: 

Yes, I am aware what I did was stupid. I appreciate your astute observations. 

Also my supervisor called in today, so I trashed the note 😎

Edit 2:

So just some clarifying things. 

My friends did the best they could. Seizures are terrifying, and they were more focused on keeping me alive than what would normally be the logical choice of calling an ambulance. 

So please stop saying I need new friends, and please stop telling I’m an idiot. I don’t really see either of those being helpful. I’m painfully aware of my mistakes. 

I hadn’t eaten. I am 5’4 and weigh 145lbs. It was however many shots in about three hours. I would normally stop at three, but I guess drunk me was like “*more*”

I will be talking to my doctor about it, but I’m scared to. 

Edit 3:
Some of you fuckers don’t believe me, so here the few pics I have from the situation. Bruises, and the jacuzzi

I myself take fluoxetine (Prosac) and have drunk alcohol many times without these issues. My main issue is being unable to stop once I start, as well as a craving to drink daily, which never happened before I was on it. As such I don't drink on it. I'm not saying 'it's safe to', you are advised not to. Not least as alcohol is a depressant so it is hard to become truely well, as well as alcohol increasing the risk of side effects such as stomach upset.

What I am confused with is why you are taking fluoxetine as well as Amitriptyline. It is quite rare to be given two antidepressents, as they have the same effect. Normally you'd be given one of 'Fluoxetine, Citalopram or Sertraline' (the main SSRIs) the dose increased if there is too little effect, switched to another if you reach the highest dose without enough effect/the side effects are intolerable. Then switched to another class of antidepressant, an SNRI like venlafaxine, or an atypical one like Amitriptyline, and as a last resort a tricyclic antidepressant. You may also have a low dose antipsychotic added, like Olanzapine.

It is very rare to be given two antidepressants as I say. You are more likely to overdose on two moderate overdoses of two ADs, than one massive overdose of a single one, due to serotonin being raised in two different ways.

This reaction does sound like serotonin syndrome: hypereflexia, diarrhoea, raised body temperature (more here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome#Signs_and_symptoms)

I'm NOT saying 'alcohol is fine!', it is always best to avoid it on medications, I'm just dubious it was the only cause. More that you were teetering with these two meds, and alcohol pushed you over the edge.

If there is a major reaction with a commonly ingested substance and a medicine, it will be stated clearly. Here it says 'AVOID ALCOHOLIC DRINK' in bold letters on the sticker, or the doctor will say it. It won't be 'buried in the fine print'. Nearly all medicines will say 'avoid alcohol' in the information leaflet, not least to reduce the risk of litigation should something like this happen.

(Forgive me for using generic names, I'm in the UK and am unfamiliar with American brand names).

I’m on welbutrin and remeron. They added welbutrin bc of my add and history of addiction. I’m in recovery now and in college, I’ve been on adderall for years, they don’t want me to take it anymore bc it’s a narcotic, even though it was never my drug of choice. Instead they prescribed 300mg’s of welbutrin In addition to the 30mg of remeron I’ve been on for like 18 months. I’ve been feeling pretty weird recently, kinda like a bad acid trip it’s weird and hard to describe. Could this be related?
there was a period of time when I was on Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Elavil all at the same time. it's quite common for psychiatrists to mix antidepressants in a patient who responds partially to one and partially to another to manage multiple symptoms.
&gt;  or an atypical one like Amitriptyline, and as a last resort a tricyclic antidepressant.

Amitriptyline is a tricyclic.
Wellbutrin doesn't work via serotonin. It's a dopamine-norepinephrine 
reuptake inhibitor. If you're prescribed wellbutrin recently, it will take at least 2-4 weeks to work properly and side effects are more common in this period.
No, it’s okay. And the Amitryptyline I’ve been taking for about 3 to 4 years now (10mg daily). It was my first prescription, and it is used to prevent my migraines as well as help me sleep. The fluoxetine (20mg daily) I’ve been taking for 2-3 years now. I wasn’t aware there was an issue in taking two medications with similar effects. This has by far been the most helpful comment I’ve read. Thank you.
Ah thanks, forgive me (still a student!)
No worries. Good luck with your studies.
I've been on more than one antidepressant several times. And I work in a pharmacy. I see it all the time. It's not rare at all.
I had a bad experience with Wellbutrin this summer. Had been taking it for a year for bipolar because I got pregnant and my regular meds don't work with pregnancy. 
Turns out, Wellbutrin lowers your seizure threshold. Totaled my car due to seizure in May, had another about a month later and then had two more the next month. 
Haven't had one since I stopped taking it.
ALWAYS familiarize yourself with the side effects list. It's good to know when to call the Dr
I'm on high dose of wellbutrin and a lowish one of trintellix (newer ssri) along with lamictal. My doctor and I are just both very aware of risks and I have to monitor myself carefully when adjusting dosages. Seems funky to be on both but adding the trintellix made all the difference. The last time I took cough medicine with DXM on top of that I had a bad time.

Edit: was mistakenly thinking wellbutrin was an snri
Yea I'm on 40mg Prozac and 450mg Wellbutrin. This is the only combination and dose to ever make me feel better in the almost 20 years since my diagnosis.

Summary:
I see it all the time.
It is very rare to be given two antidepressants as I say.
I go through all of my classes, still drunk.
Haven't had one since I stopped taking it.
So, I take Prozac and Elavil.
It's not rare at all.
I’m laughing and I fall out of the jacuzzi.
