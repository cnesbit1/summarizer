How can you come back from that? Brutal
"No u"
Itâ€™s so absurd. Itâ€™s like heâ€™s shooting a flirty dm but ending it with a threat.
Eh, werdum and wand both come across as plain old fashioned bullies. Used to be a fan of werdum, but man he's a dick sometimes. Wands just always been a thug

Also telling some one your going to knock them out over the internet? What are they, 12?
Yeah man I agree. Also I get why Wandy would be salty with Hunto because he got beat but what does Werdum have to gain picking a fight with a guy he already beat? A sore winner maybe?

Summary:
Hunt is on a path.
