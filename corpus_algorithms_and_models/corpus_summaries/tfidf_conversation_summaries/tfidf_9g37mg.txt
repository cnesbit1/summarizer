Original Response:
Knew the shit decision was coming the second Khabilov got him down in round 3. Johnson won the majority of the striking exchanges that round and landed two big knees. But laying on top of someone for a minute is once again more important to judges.
1 and half minutes 
Plus Khabilov took him down once before in round too but it got reversed.

And he landed two big shots in first 40 seconds.
People say it's russian bias, but judges did the exact same thing to Cejudo, handing him the belt. Judges aren't corrupt, they're just incompetent.
Judging fights isn’t as simple as breaking them down into time periods and saying “fighter X won for this long, and fighter Y won for this long.” Fighters are judged by the impact of their actions. Each of the knees Johnson landed alone were more impactful than anything Khabilov did in that last minute in top position. 

Also, are you really going to try and argue that a takedown which got immediately reversed is worth anything?
You never know, it could be a little bit of both. I agree though this is very similar to the DJ Cejudo fight, and these kind of shit decisions do pretty much happen everywhere.
All I'm saying is both side have an argument.
It was razor sharp 50-50
It was a clear Kajan win to anyone who knows what they're looking at/has given the scoring criteria so much as a cursory glance.  There's 0 argument for Khabilov winning 2 rounds.

Like there's already a fucking rule that's been made to cut that shit out. But people still act like it doesn't exist. Still mad about DJ losing his belt.
It's a seriously flawed system with virtually nothing being done to correct it even though there have been countless bad decisions - some by the same people over and over.
I had no idea this existed. Very cool.

Summary:
- **9/25** people scored it **47-48 Johnson**.
