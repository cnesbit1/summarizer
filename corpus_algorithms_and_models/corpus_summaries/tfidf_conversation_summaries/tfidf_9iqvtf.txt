Inexpensive e-juice that doesn't taste like plastic or chemicals?
What’s your budget and what kinda juice are you looking for?
Juice that taste like that is usually not steeped (enough).
I'd say around $7 for 30ml.

As for what I like, so far.. out of all the crap I ordered (I am new to vaping and went a little crazy lol) I only liked Silly Rabbit from Blue Dot, Rice Krisp from Vape Wild and Red Dream from Hometown Hero. 

I've tried Custard from Vape Wild, it has an alcohol aftertaste that I don't care for. Um, CTC Cereal from Blue Dot, also had an alcohol aftertaste which I am wondering if it vanilla triggering me. 

Maybe a strawberry milk? I hear its a go to for a lot of people.. but there are SOO many out there! Which one to chose is the hard part. 

I tried two flavors from Humble.. VTR and American Dream .. both have a STRONG lemon to them. And it was more chemical lemon.. The website said it was pre-steeped 2 weeks or longer.
You may want to check out northland. They’re wicked inexpensive
I dug out one that I had thought was terrible.. the American Dream.. even though the website says its pre-steeped ... its been sitting in my drawer about a week.. its better. Still to much lemon, but better. Vapable in fact. :) And I am picking up the cereal note which I hadn't before. TY!

&amp;#x200B;
yeah,  a lot of websites will claim pre steeped,  but I always tend to wait a week or two at least before trying.... If it's tasting "lemony"  (like a lot of say "cereal" juices" will on delivery),  I would let it steep longer.  I'm not familiar with the profile of the juice you are describing,  what flavor is it supposed to be?  Things like "capone" from SauceLA absolutely benefit from a longer steep time imho to reduce the lemon element...but some people like it right out of the mailbox,  it depends on your taste I guess!
2nd this!
And for their price def not bad lol
Are you in America?
Om still has a sale going. I picked up wta 30 mils for $3. Regular 30 ml bottles for $1.50-$2.
I am.
They are hard to top at their price point. Especially when they have a sale which is super often.
Oh their sales are insane!!! $9 a 120ml is impossible to pass up lol
I'm so happy you ended up liking them hehe, I remember recommending them to you at some point, probably a late night chat.
Most likely :)
It is never a good feeling when you tell someone a juice is good and they end up hating it lol.
Lol yeah I gotcha there lol
Does anybody know of vendors that offer nic salts in the 9-12mg range? I have used and enjoyed Cloudberry, but am looking for others too.

Bonus points if they offer bottles larger than 30ml or ratios below 70/30.
Red House Vapor, Elite Elixers, and Mello Vapor Craft
I'll check em out. Thanks!
Vape Wild also covers that range. You can also specify vg/pg between 80/20, 65/35 or 50/50. Some flavors are capped at 30ml, but most go up to 4oz and beyond.
Word. Thanks!
Oh wait, I failed to see that you were looking for nic salt in that range. Vape Wild produces freebase, sorry about that. But good deals over there, regardless.
I was just looking at their site wondering if I was crazy, haha!

Its all good, dude! I'm trying to step my nic levels down again so keeping them in mind for 9 and below (i can tolerate freebase in those levels) will be helpful!
Yeah, just the 9mg freebase is getting rare nowadays. The first one I tried from them was Wrangler, the tobacco flavor, and my friend had a 12mg of it. I usually do 3mg now, so that 12mg was throaty like a race car. But like in a good way.
[removed]
Blue dot does all the way down to 3 in salt, and does 50/50 as well. 30ml max bottle size for some reason though.
Blue Dot offers all the way down to 3mg nicsalt, and 50/50. Good stuff.

Summary:
But like in a good way.
Juice that taste like that is usually not steeped (enough).
Lol yeah I gotcha there lol.
And it was more chemical lemon..
Oh wait, I failed to see that you were looking for nic salt in that range.
Vape Wild also covers that range.
