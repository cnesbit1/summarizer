Huge caveat here - it’s a private members bill that doesn’t have the support of the cabinet or the party.

The Greens and a few Labor MPs might support it, but I don’t reckon it’ll pass.
The dude proposing the bill is 27, it gives me hope that once these dinosaurs that do fuck all for us as a country die out we can start seeing some actual progression.
Im 41, one of the things id really like to see end before i die is this stupid war on drugs.
Hi 41, I'm dad.
I really hope this next gen wave of positions can mostly agree on drugs being decriminalizes/legalizes, global warming is real so action is needed and actually understand the internet.
Likely to be a significant generational change at the next election.
I'm only three years younger than him, and my social circle (including myself) tend to almost forget weed is illegal. These days, it's even normal for parents to be chill with it.
I'm a similar age and it's very similar the way it is viewed in my social groups as well. The laws need to reflect society.
I want affordable alternatives to smoking pot. I want those fancy edibles and drinks the yanks get. I miss pot, but my old lungs can't hold up.
Have you considered vaping? Much less harsh on the lungs.
Yeah, my brother has a d'buddah /silver surfer vape. It's expensive to operate and I still find it's going to kill my lungs / me. I agree it's better, but it's not the solution I need.
nothing stopping you from making your own edibles, it's really not difficult
Legality if I grow and cost if I buy.
I see, I thought you meant that you smoked currently but wanted an alternative because you don't like smoking
I smoked on and off for 25 years. Stopped again 6 months ago and would like an alternative to combustion.
I'm late twenties and terrified of weed because of the legality. Is it really just that easy to come by?

Summary:
I want affordable alternatives to smoking pot.
I smoked on and off for 25 years.
