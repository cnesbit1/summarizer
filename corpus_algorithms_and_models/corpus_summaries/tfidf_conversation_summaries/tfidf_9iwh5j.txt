Original Response:
No, there are multiple, different types of filters responsible for removing components of the air.

Carbon Dioxide, being the main culprit, is absorbed on a zeolite and dumped overboard (by reheating).

Other minor impurities (such as methane and thiols from your butt) are captured in Carbon filters, which are regularly replaced and disposed of.
Now for the real question: can flatulence propel you around inside of the ISS?
Yes, but not quickly enough to be practical or even noticeable. And since it sends you in one direction and your "exhaust" in the opposite direction, it has no effect on the station itself.

So what you’re saying is that farting causes wear on a really expensive filter. How much would each fart cost on average?

For serious,
only minimally, and only if you're not wearing pants.

The fart would cause a thrust, however alot of that thrust would be countered by the fact that its hitting your pants and underwear, thus creating a thrust opposing the original thrust of your fart.

The filter would be there regardless, so I would say it isn't worth a crap. The fuel getting it to space however...
I imagine it isn't a zeolite on its own, but a zeolite and something else mixture. Do you know what it is specifically? I was just reading about LiOH mixed with zeolite which seems to work awesome for absorbing CO2.

But if it lasts longer with less farting... that’s means the farts’ value can be quantified.
Pants? That's silly, they're going to use a nozzle.
