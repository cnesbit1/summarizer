Original Response:
My family was always very tight-knit when I was growing up. 

The five of us were always doing something together. Mom took my sister and I on spa dates once a month, dad frequently took us all camping or out to dinner on the weekend.

Every summer since I can remember we have always gone on some big road trip. My favorite memories usually involve being packed in Dad’s truck with my siblings watching mile marker infinity slip by in Southern Nebraska.

Anway, married now [to 28m] if that matters. I’ve been seeing my now-husband for six years, so it was hardly out of the blue when we got married last January. My parents and siblings all seemed to love him. After we’d been dating for a while Dad invited him along on some of our camping trips, he was a frequent guest at their house for dinner.

Mom and Dad were thrilled for me when he proposed and Dad even went as far as telling my husband he was relieved I was marrying someone like him. 

So I don’t know what gives.

Like, as soon as I tied the knot it was like I got kicked out of the family. Mom didn’t call to invite me to spa day with her and my sister anymore. I have paid my own way on those since I’ve been financially independent, so it can’t be a money thing, and I’ve gone with them at least monthly. I always thought we had a great time!

But now I only know about them when my mom posts about it on facebook, usually with a title like “Mom-Daughter spa day!” which kinda twists the knife.

I asked my mom after the first couple times why I didn’t get invited and she said because she figured I wanted to spend my time with my new husband. And I tried telling her that I can afford to soend a coulle hours away from him *monthly* and she gave me a non-committal “Oh, okay.” But she still doesn’t invite me and it’s makijg me feel like I’m just not supposed to come.

Its the same thing with dinners. It used to be I would go over to their house one night a week for some big family dinner. Dad would make soemthing on the grill, I’d help mom inside. Sometimes my husband would join, but most of the time not, and it was really nice to be just around the family.

But now I don’t get told about those, either. If I ask about having dinner one night a week my parents usually respond something like “Oh, feel free to come by whenever.” And when I show up they just tell me I can hear up something from the fridge, because they already cooked something big a few nights ago *without telling me!!*

And what really broke me was in early August. I knew we were running out of time before my siblings had to go back to school so one day I texted my brother to ask if mom and dad had said anything about the family trip this year.

Bro responded that they were taking a road trip to a big national park out west. I got a lump in my throat that I had apparently not been informed about this, either, so I asked bro if I was welcome on it. He said he had to ask Dad, then a few hours later hit me back that “They only made reservations for the four of us.” 

And I guess that just did it. I called my brother (because I didn’t really know what I would say to mom and dad right then) and begged to know why I was being excluded from all of our old family stuff. My brother told me “I’m not sure, but I think Dad just wants to keep it the [my maiden name]-family trip. You’re not really a [maiden name] anymore. You’re a [my married name] now.”

I don’t think he meant that quite as maliciously as it sounds, but it was still too much to hear and I just hung up the phone so i could go cry.

My (former?) family got back not long ago and their facebook pages are all covered with pics of them having fun together and apparently not missing me one little bit.

I felt a little better for a while because after I went and cried on my husband’s shoulder about all of this he managed to scrape together some time off and took me on a little road trip of our own. It was a wonderful trip and an amazingly sweet thing of him to do, but I’m still so incredibly sad that I’m apparently not a member of my “old” family anymore.

And I feel kinda bad for being sad because my husband is really trying to make me feel better and making dinners with me and he’s gotten me a couple weekends at the spa, and I really do appreciate that, it just doesn’t really help the underlying sadness that my family I guess just doesn’t want me anymore.

Why would my family drop me like this? Just because I’m married? I wanted a bigger family, not a *new* one! And what can I do to help my husband understand that I do really appreciate his efforts, but he can’t make the hurt of being kicked out of my family just go away?

**TL;DR**: I got married a few months ago. Ever since I’ve been dropped from pretty much all activities from my previously very tight knit family and they act like I’m not part of their family anymore. Why? How do I address it?
I totally get what they are doing. You probably were not ready mentally for such a drastic change. It is time to grow up and leave the nest. 

There will be many phases in life. That phase when you were the just the daughter is over and time to be a wife and maybe a mother later. But you are being stubborn and not letting that phase of your life go. 

You should be looking forward to the change and new phase in life ahead of you rather than looking back.
What's with all this "leave the nest" talk, as if OP moved out of her parents' house the day she got married? She spent time with them a couple times a month and took yearly vacations with them, I don't understand why you're acting like she's ridiculous for being hurt and confused at their suddenly excluding her from everything they do as a family. OP can be a wife and still be a part of her original family, implying that she has to give up everything about life before marriage and just be a wife/mother is insulting and diminishes her feelings and experiences.
I was speaking metaphorically by saying “leave the nest”. As we all will have to leave the parents one day to start our own family. I never said she was being ridiculous for feeling hurt. Rather I was empathic to her and acknowledged that the change in lifestyle was too drastic for her to deal with as she probably wasn’t mentally ready for such change. 

When I talk about her being the wife now and maybe a mother later, I am talking about the different phases of her life. We have to let some things go to gain new experiences. I never said she has to give up everything rather you assumed the implication. However, she has to divide her time wisely now, we can’t have everything.
&gt;I never said she has to give up everything 

&gt;But you are being stubborn and not letting that phase of your life go

So which is it, then? She doesn't have to stop spending a couple hours a month with her family, or she does?

Telling OP to grow up and leave the nest and stop being stubborn is not what being empathetic means.
Both things can be true simultaneously. 

That phase of being a daughter only. She has to let go. Now she has to be a wife too. 

I was being empathetic when I said the change was too drastic for her. 

Then I went on to make other points to help at least see things from a different perspective. 

Change is good.
I never said change wasn't good, but it's strange and cruel to very suddenly drop her from things that she's been a part of her entire life with no explanation. She's not being stubborn by feeling hurt and confused, her reaction is completely appropriate.
Yes, change is good. You agree. But does she know that this change can also be good? I just don’t think she can see it right now and accommodating her feelings won’t help her see it. 

I understand why she is feeling this way but I don’t think she is focusing enough on what her new life could be. 

Of course her reaction is understandable. But feelings are subconscious and stubbornness is conscious. So I’m not saying she is being stubborn for feeling this way as we can’t control our feelings. But she is being stubborn not accepting the changes in her life.
Once again, we're talking about *a couple of hours a month* and *one yearly trip* that she's suddenly and unceremoniously been cut out of, with no explanation. 

This isn't about her refusing to accept change, it's about an unexplained and cruel exclusion from things that she's always been a part of. How is wanting to take part in *a couple of hours a month* of activities with your family in any way whatsoever "not focusing enough on what her new life could be"? 

She's not being stubborn by being confused and hurt, there's nothing stubborn about this, she's not insisting and forcing herself upon them, she's simply trying to understand why her family has cut her out of their lives.
Once again, I am not saying she is being stubborn for feeling hurt as feelings are in our subconscious mind and being stubbornness conscious mind. We can’t control our feelings. I never tell people to feel certain way because we can’t control it. 

It doesn’t matter to me how many hours, minutes, seconds a year it is. All those things hinder the new change to be successful. You may disagree with me on that and that is fine. I
That might not be the normal "way of things" in her parents' minds though. Even if they don't see her as "belonging" to husband's family, they might now see her-and-husband as a unit in a way they didn't pre-marriage, and feel that it's not appropriate to invite her solo. 

Her communication to them has also been circumspect.  "I can afford to spend a couple hrs away from husband" wrt the spa day doesn't exactly scream "I love spa day and want it to continue," it almost comes across as an obligation she could get away to do if needed. She was more blunt with her bro about the trip, but we don't know how bro communicated with the parents, so no idea if the point came across. 

OP needs to sit down with her folks and explain how she would like their family life to continue now that she's married, and ask them how they see it.
I’m sorry but this doesn’t make any sense to me. A fiancé and girlfriend can meet up with their mother but a wife or mother can’t?  I’m married and let me tell you, its not some magical event that changes you and makes spa days impossible. This isn’t medieval times where she would have a new role completely and would be expected to defer to her husband over her parent. 

How far are her parents going to take this?  Does being married mean she’s no longer invited to holiday events?  What about birthdays?  

I could maybe understand the vacation invite because they don’t want to change the family dynamic by having a spouse invited, but I don’t see why her parents wouldn’t discuss this with their daughter before just not inviting them. I would be super hurt here and would have a heart to heart with my parents.
Your advice sounds pretty misogynic. You're basically saying she belongs to her husband now and can't spend any time with her family.

Summary:
But you are being stubborn and not letting that phase of your life go.
I never said she was being ridiculous for feeling hurt.
I wanted a bigger family, not a *new* one!
She has to let go.
But she is being stubborn not accepting the changes in her life.
Its the same thing with dinners.
So I don’t know what gives.
Why would my family drop me like this?
