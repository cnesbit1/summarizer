Went to Sim Lim Square to try the famous salted egg yolk chicken rice today and it blew my mind!! Any more restaurants that sell good salted egg yolk chicken?
Is this from sim lim square basement foodcourt?
It's in Sim Lim but I think it's level 2!! Not basement! ðŸ˜Š
omg that actually looks so gooddddddddd
It actually is good!
That's my fav salted egg chicken too!!! Had it all the time when I was interning near there
Thereâ€™s one at jiayuen eating house in Paya Lebar. It sells a slightly difference version that translates to salted egg yolk cream chicken
Do you know if it's open in the weekend?
Name of that place is Taste Good. Cai png starts at around 10am and salted egg starts at 12pm. So go there for lunch. Open on weekends.
Oooh the shop on level 2 that's closer to the sex shop sells good salted egg yolk chicken rice too.
Oh. I tried the basement one before and it was good as well
Used to order it to camp (during NS days) and it was a real treat. Went back a few months ago, quality has dropped significantly with a marked increase in price; paid almost $10 for a plate topped with cereal.
this one not bad, the flavour is pretty good, unfortunately chicken tenderness can be improved!
There are two stalls at level 2 try both!
