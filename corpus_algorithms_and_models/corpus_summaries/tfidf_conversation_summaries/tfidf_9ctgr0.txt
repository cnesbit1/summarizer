Original Response:
Hey everyone, just let me know if I have this right:

Do arguments for the divinity of Christ boil down to the fact that the apostles who personally knew Jesus wouldn't have subjected themselves to the persecutions that followed had they *not* witnessed something extraordinary? (His life and resurrection).

How does this argument contend with the following objections:

- That the various texts (Biblical and otherwise) were written decades after the events, and that the deaths of the apostles may not be true depictions of the facts?

- That even today, there are individuals and groups who do inexplicable things for reasons we can't understand (partaking in mass suicides, for example), and yet we never suppose their motives are evidence of the truths of their beliefs?

- That in the story itself, many people react to Jesus as if he were a regular preacher, not an actual miracle worker (e.g. Would Judas really have sold Jesus if he had seen him raise people from the dead? Would the Jewish priests have condemned someone who had been witnessed multiplying food? Would Thomas really have doubted?).

I can see the value of the original argument, if I got it correctly, but I'm curious if the objections are raised have been addressed.
