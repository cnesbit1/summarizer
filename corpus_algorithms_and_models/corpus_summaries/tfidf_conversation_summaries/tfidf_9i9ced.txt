Original Response:
‚ÄúSkin contains the pigment melanin which is activated by exposure to light. The palms of your hands and the soles of your feet have much thicker layers of skin due to their regular contact and friction with other objects (the ground, tools, etc). Melanocytes exist in the dermal layers of your palms and soles, but are buried beneath the more callous layers and are rarely directed at the sun. You could in theory try to tan your hands but the results would be pretty minimal compared to the rest of your body.‚Äù

Uh...touching things?

That causes minimal friction though if you're just touching things. The same kind of minimal friction, the other side of your hands get exposed to.

I don't know, I think the amount of friction you exert over a day to the inside of your hands might be quite a lot - every door handle, keyboard stroke, grabbing the smartphone, holding a fork, playing guitar... practically everything you interact with touches the inside of your hands. 

Great, now I'll be thinking about how much friction I'm exerting on my hands for the next couple of weeks.
How do you think blisters happen from working?
[removed]
don't you hold stuff with your hands and walk with your feet?
Outside the same as the inside? You must not do anything.
What side of your hand do you use when you use a hammer, a frying pan, piano keys, handling of small and large objects and grab on to things?

Take a physics class. Friction isn't just when two things are moving against each other (kinetic friction), but also present when they are not moving against each other (called static friction). When you hold a hammer, it is almost entirely static friction holding it, from your palm. Same with most other objects. Everything you hold is experiencing friction with your hand, whether lateral or vertical

Friction is how we hold things. Our palms are actually designed to be higher friction than other parts of our skin -- that's the function of fingerprints.

Maybe you're thinking friction = rubbing? That's not actually what we mean -- friction is the property of something that prevents things from sliding past each other easily. When you rub two things together rapidly, heat is generated due to the energy used to overcome friction.
It's not called static friction. The proper term is potential friction.

*"Skin contains the pigment melanin which is activated by exposure to light."*

Is that also why sometimes your skin gets/seems slightly darker/lighter (at least in my experience) depending on the light?

But how about the armpits??
[removed]
[removed]
[removed]
How is this wrong? It's basic anatomy. The skin on your palms and soles of your feet is genetically/structurally different than on the rest of your body. It's literally just called thick skin vs thin skin. The thick skin has a much thicker layer of dead keratinocytes (stratum corneum) that covers up the stratum basale/spinosum where melanocytes that produce melanin and make skin dark exist.

The melanocytes produce melanin in RESPONSE to UV so, if UV can't reach them as much, then they'll produce less melanin. So the melanocytes would produce less melanin and also be covered in a thick layer of keratinocytes and keratin coated in lipids which typically look whiter.

The melanocytes that give the palms their color exist only in the epidermis, not dermis. There are less melanocytes to make melanin at that location overall. And therefore, less pigment to transfer to the surrounding keratinocytes. Skin thickness is just one part of lack of color.

Just to clarify, do you mean that the increased friction caused us to evolve thicker skin in those areas or would other areas of our skin respond the same way to increased friction?

Melanocytes secrete the melanosomes to the keratinocytes which then carry it ‚Äûup‚Äú as they travel through the different layers of skin. 
That they are located at the bottom of the epidermis (stratum basale, just above the the dermins) is irrelevant to the color of the skin. 
Furthermore, the keratinocytes being exposed to sun is the actual stimulating factor for melanocytes to produce melanin. Again, it doesn‚Äòt matter by how many cells they are covered as they don‚Äòt need direct sun exposure to produce melanin. 
I sadly don‚Äòt know the answer to OP‚Äòs question, but yours is definitely not correct, or at least not the full story.

So if someone somehow never used their hands at all they'd be the same color as the rest of their skin?
So if it had anything to do with light, I would imagine areas of the body that never saw much would remain white? Or at least lighter? I'm not sure I buy this explanation.
[removed]

So is the extra dead skin with no melanin literally white? Translucent? 

If my palms have the same dead melaninless layer as someone who's black why is there no notable contrast between my palms and arms but there is on a black person?

I guess what I'm saying is, shouldn't my palms be even MORE white? I have so little melanin to start with that the skin on my palms should look nearly completely melaninless to the point where I should have palms that look made of paper or are just super see through?

In reality my palms are slightly darker and pinker than the rest of my arm.

IIRC some neurohormone (melanocortin?) stimulates melanin production when it's being released, but only for dermal tissue that's growing right then. So any dermal tissue that grows entirely because of‚Äîor coincidentally during‚Äîmelanocortin release, will end up dark.

It's why pregnant womens' areolae end up dark‚Äîthe tissue grows and stretches, and melanocortin is active at the time, so the new skin is dark.

It's also why certain scar tissue or stretch marks can end up dark, if the scar's healing or the skin's stretching is occurring during melanocortin release.

Now, although we don't really fully understand human sexual-arousal neurology, we know that activation of some of melanocortin's receptors tends to make people (more) horny. There was a [drug made to exploit that effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremelanotide).

So *my guess* at an explanation here, is that skin that grows (or regrows due to use/abuse/scarring/stretching) entirely *while* you're sexually aroused... where that sexual arousal was being stimulated by melanocortin production... might end up growing in darker.
[removed]
No. Its why you tan and stuff. This is about prolonged exposure to light. The thing you experienced is called "lighting" and can make things look lighter or darker due to different levels of light.

The palms?

I thnk this is incorrect. 

Melanocyte precursor cells are in the hair follicles. No hair, no melanocytes. We have no hair on our palms....ergo no melanocytes...ergo no pigment. In the rest of our skin they migrate from the hair follicles to the nearby skin after differentiation....also...in people whose hair has gone completely white, they are generating no new melanocytes, and they have an age-related version of vitiligo (pigment loss) in which the skin is pink and white in splotches. Look at some white-haired person's skin sometime...
"Very early in the process one of the scientists, Mac Hadley, who was conducting experiments on himself with an early tool compound, melanotan II, injected himself with twice the dose he intended and experienced an eight-hour erection, along with nausea and vomiting."

It works!

Also, "A¬†New Drug Application¬†of bremelanotide for female sexual dysfunction was accepted by the FDA in June 2018 with a PDUFA date set for March 23, 2019", so that is still to come in the US, at least.

But then a baby's palm is still white right? They might have not used their palms inside mother's belly. Or does that count as evolution thingy?
[removed]
Yes, but you‚Äôd have to sun a lot since the outer layer of skin is so thick. The outer layer is made up of dead cells, you don‚Äôt get a sunburn (tissue damage) until the living cells beneath are harmed. They could be harmed either from direct UV radiation (DNA damage) or indirectly from the heat.

Yes, thin skin + large amount of blood vessels causes this e.g. under your eyes. Also when the skin is tightly packed together in let's say *a flaccid penis*, it amplifies this effect.

However, melanin also has a signficant effect too which is why you can bleach to substantially reduce the darkness of your skin.
What about butts then. They are not (directly) related to sexual arousal, they are usually much less exposed than backs or legs, but they are not any lighter in black people. Why?

Roughly how many generations of clothes wearing people would it take before people with darker skin have light torsos because their bodies aren't exposed to sunlight? Or does it not work like that?

This sounds like a ridiculously contrived reason. When a penis becomes erect it's the same shade as the rest of your body, when it's flaccid you're seeing more skin bunched together of course it's going to look darker.
Nice answer! Thanks for sharing! :)
