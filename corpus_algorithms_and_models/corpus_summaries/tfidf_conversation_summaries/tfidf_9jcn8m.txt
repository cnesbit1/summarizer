Yeah, my dad was very non-huggy and even though I only realized it way later, I really kissed it.
shit like this blows my mind. I live in a huge city and I've never once questioned a man at the playground with kids? like, what are these weirdos thinking
This is sad! I would never think that if I saw you in the park.

Sorry your typo made me laugh.
I take my stepkids to the park and all I ever get is friendly smiles from other parents.
Projection probably. Who else’s mind would go to that place so quickly.
My boyfriend’s daughter is 5, his son is 8. I’m female. 

They’re both very affectionate with me. I adore them in return. But his daughter especially wants to hold hands and cuddle and the likes. 

While I don’t have to generally worry that society will judge me because I am female and often assumed to be their mother, I still feel some worry that something could be interpreted inappropriately. Their mom already doesn’t like me and what if they said something to her that came off wrong and it caused her to make accusations against me? I help his daughter change at her request, and have seen both kids undressed, for example (I’ve been in their lives for  a while now and waited 14 months of dating their dad before meeting them). I worry if they said “Alana saw me naked” their mom could try to make it into a big deal. 

My boyfriend knows the interactions I have with his kids as he’s around 99% of the time. He’s comfortable with it and if anything goes to far (the kids are too forward, e.g.) he will gently correct them. But I still have that nagging fear. 

It probably doesn’t help I worked with kids involved with CPS for few years and there was many allegations in court of inappropriate behaviors toward children.
