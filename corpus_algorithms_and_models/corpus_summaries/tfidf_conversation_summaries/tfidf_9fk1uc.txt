Original Response:
I have struggled for years with my sexual confidence and my husband just destroyed the little I had. 

We have been married for almost 4 years. And and a few years ago he began making weird comments about our sex life. I’m not all that sexually experienced and he’s told me that he likes noises during sex (anything from soft moaning to screaming) because he’s thinks it’s sexy. So I obliged. Then suddenly one day out of the blue he started imitating the noises that I make and repeating things I say in a mocking tone (almost like a bad porno). I didn’t appreciate that and it made me feel embarrassed. I’ve asked him to stop several times right when he says something but he just laughs at me. 

So now when we’re having sex I don’t do or say anything for fear of what he’s going to say. Now I don’t know how to fix it. And he’ll sometimes say he’s joking but it’s not funny. It’s hurtful. 

Edit: and we are in marriage counseling (for other reasons) but we haven’t talked to our counselor about our sex life
Bring it up to your counselor. *Do not withhold sex as a threat*.

You tried to please him and after a while the way he reacted started to hurt you even though you were trying to please him.

Do it in front of the counselor because he may dismiss it at home but you bringing it up there means he can't back away, and he has to explain himself.

For all you know he may be teasing you and unintentionally hurting your feelings.

You get nowhere with threats, you get somewhere with understanding.

Sex needs to be consensual. Withholding it is her right as a human and it’s the law. Her withholding it should come from a place of him not deserving it. It’s not meant to be taunted or held as a weapon. Sex should be a way to show your love and should come from a place of respect and enjoyment.

He may think she’s using it as a threat, but that’s his opinion. He’s actually threatening her by acting like a scary prick, when she says no. Like “fuck me or else”. How dare you make her feel that withholding it means she’s weaponizing it.

Once she looses the power to be able to say no, she is a victim. That’s serious and should not be tolerated by anyone. Sex needs to be consensual, EVERY single time.
Fuck that!! He's hurting her feelings and she owes him nothing!! It's her body and she has every right to withhold sex, no matter what the reason!!  Sex should be fun and pleasurable for both parties, and there's no way she's enjoying it while being mocked! She has a right to her own body!  She also said that he blew up on her and scared her when she mentioned not having sex with him. This is not a reasonable dude. What happens when she gets home from this counselor? When she just 'embarrassed' him by bringing it up to a 3rd party? You really think he isn't going to blow his shit on her when they get home, when she's alone and defenseless? Fuck this dude. He's a piece of shit and doesn't deserve sex. I hope she leaves him as soon as humanly possible.
