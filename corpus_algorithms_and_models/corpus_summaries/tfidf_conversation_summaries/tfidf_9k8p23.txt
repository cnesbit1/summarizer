I guess you play dirty when your starting roster gets out played by some kids and AHLers.
You mean like Bortuzzo did less than a week ago?
No no, different.

I'm gonna agree with that.
I mean I’m not excusing Wilson and he deserves what he gets, and I’m also aware that you’re probably upset, but didn’t your A team just get shut out last time? By the backup goalie? Maybe settle down a little
Who are you preaching too? Where did I say we looked amazing last week?
But he's barely gonna be a starter and he's not really a repeat offender compared to Wilson.
Pot or kettle? Did you watch the last preseason game between the Caps/Blues?
Also, flair up pussy

L
I had flair, I guess it’s broken. But maybe quit baby raging in the game day thread cause then you end up losing and looking like a salty bitch?
I think that's the joke, buddy.
who cares? it's just preseason.

Summary:
Did you watch the last preseason game between the Caps/Blues?
Where did I say we looked amazing last week?
