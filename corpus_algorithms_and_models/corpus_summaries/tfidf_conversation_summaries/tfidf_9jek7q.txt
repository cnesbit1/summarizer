Original Response:
I just wanted to put it out there that I played PUG T4 fractal last night with a random healing renegade.  I almost facetanked everything just focusing on my rotation because I went from 0 to 100 health in seconds.  I think it's time we stop saying "looking for druids" and start putting "looking for healer" on LFG.  I know druids provide more utilities and what not, but seriously, I would take a good healing renegade over fresh built druid not knowing what to do in my PUGs.
I think it's already pretty well known that druid healing is actually one of the lowest of the healing specs in the game. It can be outclassed in healing potential by revenant, by tempest, and by firebrand. 

What druid brings though for groups is not just the healing potential though, it also brings spirits, which are a damage boost on their own, and spotter, for crit chance. Also, it's an easy source of offensive boons like might and fury. While the boon responsibility can be distributed elsewhere, you can't say the same for the first two unless you bring a soulbeast as well as one of your DPS picks. 

revenant healer can bring assassin's presence and bring alacrity, so there is definitely some benefit to bringing one along, but overall, druid is picked up because of its utility primarily.

if you play this as healing druid in fractals you would be kicked :D druids are there for migth from CA and spirits and mayby glyph of enpowerment. if you paly this in open world its ok of course

Fractals and raids are the only real end game pve in the game, of course there's going to be people who want to maximize effectiveness. Sure what you run is viable and it's fine but you are gimping your damage by taking druid and not replacing it with boons and heals. In a game where you want to maximize you're speed clears (especially for raids which have enrage timers) it becomes important. At lower levels and even most T4s you'll be fine, but you wont reach the highest end stuff without catching some flak for not healing.
If there's a game without them, I haven't found it yet. That said, in a Raid or high-tier Fractal environment you (ideally) shouldn't need Quickening Zephyr, so you always have the option of swapping it out for Frost Spirit if you need to appease someone. Aside from that, play whatever works best for you - anyone who thinks the most optimal meta builds are 100% required to clear content is delusional as far as I'm concerned.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with playing the way you want (unless it's actively holding your party back, and that isn't even a factor in a lot of the game). I was more referring to how, in a more organised environment, you'll probably have high enough Quickness uptime from other sources to render Quickening Zephyr redundant. You could, in theory, swap in something more healing-oriented if you so desired and your build would probably still work just fine; I just suggested Frost Spirit because it's fairly low-maintenance (just plop it down in the middle of your group and remember to replace it when it expires) it having it will get you a decent amount of goodwill from PUGs. If you want to run Glyph of Alignment or Empowerment (another skill that people will be happy to see) instead, or even, I don't know, Muddy Terrain, you should still be able to get the job done.

This is, of course, all assuming you're playing in a Raid or high-level Fractal environment in the first place; if you're just running around healing people in open-world then yeah, Quickening Zephyr is a pretty solid pick.
I just try to make sure I’m doing my part when I druid. Because my goal is to finish the end game Fractals to finish within an hour

It’s not that hard you can learn to play it within a day. It’s not like you have to practice a crazy DPS rotation over and over.
Play whatever u want to play with your own group, as far as my group if i see a druid not doing his/her job ez kick cuz my time is important and i want to get through the daily grind as fast as possible, so i can play what i enjoy. So yeah play how you want to play if you start your own group. I won't try to convert you to play the way i want it to be played aka meta, and i won't bother about how you want to play your class either as long as it doesn't affect me.
you are losing so much potential might its not even funny, and the dps you are gaining from using longbow is nothing in comparison to the dps you will gain from using spirits and axe/wh. Sure, you can play to "your" strengths, but that sounds like an excuse for being bad imo. Druid is not hard, placing down spirits every 30 seconds is not rocket science, neither is swapping to axe/wh for a cheeky 5. Quickening zephyr and glyph of tides, i dont know why you would use these over glyph of empowerment or spirits in a fractal scenario. If you played like this, you'd get kicked very quickly, because why would someone want a lb/ staff camping driud that doesnt use spirits over another one that actually buffs the team. Its not a preference thing, you are letting the team down with this build. It is not an "elitist" thing, it is a git gud thing.
Yesterday we had a druid on Dhuum who didn't use GOTL, our whole raid literally had 2-3 stacks of might at best and he didn't even answer when we told him to take GOTL.
