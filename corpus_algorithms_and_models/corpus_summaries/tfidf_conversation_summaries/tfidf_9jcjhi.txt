For both full time and part time students, did things change for the better after autonomous status? Considering joining next year.
it could be helpful if u could include where did u get or hear this idea/thought from
The recent mothership article on Wikipedia name change and I also saw confessions page
well bcuz the school somewhat "emphasizes" a lot of self learning and people are complaining they are not getting enough help for their studies so probably it comes from there
Their self study material doesn't prepare you for their exams!
you gotta practice more on past year paper, the self study material only gives you some basic understanding... if you have any doubts, you can ask your lecturer in class. Best way is to self study, learn the materials then attend the class. Gotta be more pro-active in this... i learnt it the hard way :(

I wish they gave answers for pyp. No need spoon feed, but having some solutions would be great. :(
Classes feel really rushed too! While e modules are a complete joke
yea, for part time studies, the time spent on class is never enough for exam, only enough for group project, hence we need to take charge of how we learn and what to ask. 

During my days, i keep a healthy relationship with our part-time lecturer and ask them if its OK to email them any queries i may have. Usually they are fine with it.
There is a saying, "Nothing is new under the sun". You gotta find ways to solve the PYP, try to ask in class, if not you can always google the answer or ask it online at forums such as reddit.

I remember for my accounting and finance paper, i got most of my answers from past year in ACCA, with step by step guide... you have to find ways to help yourself.
