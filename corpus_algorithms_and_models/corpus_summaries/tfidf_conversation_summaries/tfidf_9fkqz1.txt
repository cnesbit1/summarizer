Original Response:
I like Tyron so I hope his song doesn't suck, but I'm pretty concerned.
Song is gonna be baaad but it's okay. He's out here living his best life.
Bisping listened to his album, and said it was actually better than he thought.
Not many people have the spirit of a fighter and the soul of an artist, that's what makes Usman so special.

Yeah honestly as someone who produces music, I’m very for Tyron making shitty rap music. It’s honestly cool to see a guy so good at fighting branching out and being confident with it. More power to him, I just hope he’s not banking on a post fight music career, yet at least
T Wood has so many side hustles, he's the one dude I'm not worried about post-fight career. He's gonna be on our screens for a long long time.
Yeah he’s a really smart dude, he could have a few ventures that do well
Shit, I'd even be down if he produced Champ Camp for other people. I'd love to see what goes on really behind the scenes on other high level fighters.
This would be an awesome series if he did it
He was in a tttterrible Indian movie too
haha holy shit

Summary:
Shit, I'd even be down if he produced Champ Camp for other people.
