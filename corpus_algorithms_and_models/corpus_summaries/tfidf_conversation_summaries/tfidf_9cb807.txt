Original Response:
What the hell happened? You're not going that fast to low side from loss of traction, you didn't over rev the engine, I didn't see sand or oil on the road... I've got nothing.
Yep I still have zero clue , cause I didnt brake, gave enough gas to straight up the lean angle and my tire pressure was good as well.
How do you not have any clue? Haha it’s clear as day you were way too hot and leaned way to quick with I’m sure cold af tires 😂😂
Wrong about the tires and cold part cause this happened around 5 PM and I was riding for like 40 min to 50 before this happened on a hot day and the tires are 2 months old and about 2500km on them. And I have leaned far more before for slower turn.
Tires can cool off rather quickly. But ya. Just go with the idea of it being an anomaly lol 👍🏻
How could the tires be cold if he was riding for two thirds of an hour before this?

Nice attempt at trollin lul

That or /u/FamilyOfSteele is one of those riders who uses cold tires (or sand, or wet leaves) as a crutch to explain literally every crash because they don't know what they're talking about.
Wasn’t trolling. Was just my opinion on what happened. How dare I don’t have psychic powers to know he was riding all day. Also, just cause he was riding doesn’t mean his tires can handle ANYTHING that’s thrown at them. I’m all ears to hear your explanation of his crash. I like how you say I’m trolling as you troll me with “I bet he does this” troll line. Great logic 👍🏻

Been riding for 10+ years with 2 crashes. One my fault and one was a drivers fault. 
If I don’t know what I’m talking about, prove me wrong then.
OP straight up told you that he'd been riding for nearly an hour, and your response was basically "nah bro your tires had cooled down". Road tires are not very sensitive to heat, and even if he'd been on stone cold racing slicks he probably could've carried that kind of lean angle around that corner if his technique was good. If you want to see a proper explanation read the comments towards the top of this thread about acceleration unloading the front tire and OP being too stiff on the bars. 

It wasn't "just your opinion on what happened", you were giving OP shit about not knowing for sure what he did wrong while telling him it was his tires, which is bullshit. If you don't know what you're talking about don't act like you do, and especially don't be an asshole about it.
Lmao ok cool it wasn’t his tires then, I also mentioned how quick he leaned over could’ve part of the problem along with as you mentioned accelerating and unloading the front. I’m fine with being wrong, I have nothing to prove. If someone is offended by the way something is said or typed. That doesn’t make me an asshole. Just makes other people easily offended. I’d say the same thing if it was my friend who uploaded the video. Calling it a cold tire crash by watching the video isn’t crazy, it does look like one lol.

You were cool up until this bit. It's not just the way you said it, you were obviously trying to shit on OP. And yeah, shitting on someone while telling them a load of rubbish and trying to act like you know what you're talking about does kinda make you an asshole. You should work on that.

Summary:
