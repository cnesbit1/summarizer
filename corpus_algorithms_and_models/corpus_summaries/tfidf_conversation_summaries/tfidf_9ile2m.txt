Faith Goldy literally recited the 14 words, but the *Star* is the one dog whistling?

Neo-Nazi? Citation needed.
Taking a smiling photo??

Damn, why isn’t he in jail yet!!?
Well she appeared on the Daily Stormer, a prominent neo-nazi publication
Ok just because someone uses Nazi talking points and posts on Nazi websites doesn't make them a nazi /s
My mistake!  What an embarrassing blunder on my part.
And she loves her 14 words.
Being quoted by buzzfeed doesn't make me a bi douchebag, why would speaking to a neo-nazi make me a nazi?
IF YOU KEEP CALLING NEO-NAZIS ACTUAL NAZIS YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME VOTE FOR THE NEO-NAZIS! THIS IS A RATIONAL POSITION!
She went on some edgelord podcast once, and therefor must be cast out of society. In her hysterical critics' minds, if you talk to someone then you automatically have the same beliefs as them.
Haha can you imagine if this was real?

I'd be the gayest person in the world after playing on X-box live.
You guys have cried racist one too many times and now no one cares. Too bad for you.
She's also advocated for Canada to be 'white' again.
Well, this time it's true. Please look at her history
Yes.... that’s what you guys say *every* time someone openly acknowledges their own Nazi viewpoints, lol.

LMAO.....so good thing the context is cut off. So what if she's saying it as a an example of free speech? That words should not be banned no matter how ridiculous? Lmao this is no smoking gun
["FAKE NEWS!!!"](https://giphy.com/gifs/consent-yW19CclEuGFva)
So whats the context?
The context is her being dared to say it by a neo nazi, then she does.
Exactly my point. Why was she being dared? Maybe because the media do exactly this. BANNED WORDS AND PHRASES. Once you speak them you are forever banned. This is fascism 101
The person who dared her was a neo nazi podcast host, not "the media."
