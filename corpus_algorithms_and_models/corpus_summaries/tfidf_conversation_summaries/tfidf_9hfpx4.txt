Original Response:
(I tried to reply to another comment agreeing with the undergraduate but it got deleted.)

I agree with you. I find it disconcerting that all except your comment (so far) thought the undergraduate was too sensitive. I think the other comments were, on the contrary, not sensitive enough. I think it's because we weren't affected by it and those comments fail to be compassionate enough to put themselves in the shoes of the victims.

We live in Singapore so we probably weren't affected by 9/11 much. But it shouldn't take a person so much effort to realize that people who were friends of family of victims could still be traumatized even after 17 years. The same goes for WW2. As an example: the Japanese. Many of us from the young demographic are indifferent to Japanese people. But if you were to ask an elder in Singapore who had possibly experienced the terror of Sook Ching, they might still have anti-Japanese sentiments even after, what, 50 years(?) have passed.

Just because we did not experience a traumatic historic(al) event and thus not have any feelings to it doesn't mean we should make jokes about. What is a joke to us may not be a joke to others, especially in this highly interconnected generation of the Internet.

If something on the internet offends you, just close the tab.

The solution should never be to prevent someone else from expressing themselves, barring extreme exceptions like hate speech. Memes definitely do not fall within the exceptions.

I firmly believe that social media networks such as Facebook and Reddit should also be regulated or even censored, as they frequently contain posts, graphics and memes of similar nature ^/s
Thanks for being the only replier with a non-sarcastic constructive comment and balls to not simply downvote.

Your comment is directed at the wrong audience. If it offends me, I definitely close the tab. Maybe I even unsubscribe from whatever channel it was. But what about those who *don't* close the tab? The problem is not "does it offend someone?", it is "does the content possibly cause one's beliefs to change or cause one to be desensitised?" If highly impressionable people see such 'jokes' online, they may think that it is alright to engage in such behaviour.

You raise hate speech, which I assume to be against issues such as race and religion, as an exception. If it my belief that [certain race] is inferior than others, should you censor me? You say no, because it is an 'extreme exception'. Why do you count this as an 'extreme exception'?  On this point I agree with you. Race and religion are volatile topics. There are countless wars and fights where differences in race or religion were the main factor. It could lead to unrest, injury and death. These are arguably extreme conditions. That is why we censor it.

So why can't the same be said for ideas relating to terrorrism? Terrorism leads to unrest, injury and death too. Just because it is a meme? What if it's a racist meme, then we shouldn't censor it? A meme is simply a form of transference of ideas.

Terrorism is a form of hate. In this 9/11 case, it is hate on a nation, namely the USA, and even the world. If anything, I think terrorism is an even more dangerous hate, because terrorism itself **is** the spread of fear and maybe even injury and death.
I upvoted you because you gave a reasonable argument from another point of view yet got downvoted because people didn't agree with you.
There is no such thing as hate speech, it is only speech that you dislike.
Like it or not, the meme contains truth. If society can not face the truth, it will in one way or another, fall into the abyss.
If your friend makes a racist joke to a group of people, do you correct your friend or report it to the police? Their actions may be insensitive but it did not warrant a police report.
I agree that truth should not be censored. That is why we have wikipedia and history books on these kind of topics, to learn from  history. But the meme was ‘Just do it’. If you say that is the truth, you are advocating terrorism. Is that your intention?
Your logic is slightly flawed to me. I think we can agree that terrorism is ‘more dangerous’ than racism. Racism may not warrant a police report, but that does not mean terrorism does not warrant a police report.

But I think you bring up another good issue that I have missed out: whether it is worth reporting. Racism can in fact be reported. But there are several issues. 

1) How severe is it? If you post ‘[certain race] are dumb lol’, a few people would probably get angry but not to the extent that they would report it. But if you post ‘I want to **kill** all the [certain race]’ which is very similar to terrorism, would you *not* report it? 

2) Does it matter that they are your ‘friend’ or not? If a stranger made the above killing claim, you would probably report it. If your friend made the claim, would you? If you don’t, then this is what we call ‘double standards’. It also shows that you are willing to be friends with a racist, but that your personal matter. Either way, whether someone is your friend or not should not affect your decision to report, unless you have friendship over national and global security, then I wouldn’t say you are a very safe citizen to begin with.

3) Is it truly a ‘joke’? I think this is similar to point one. Calling someone dumb may be a joke, but killing? You may argue that ‘they joked about killing in a light tone’, but remember, this is the Internet where written tone cannot be conveyed.

Now let’s assess the meme in question. ‘Just do it’. Do what? Crash planes into buildings. 1) Is this a mere ‘lol you dumb’ meme? No, it is advocating violence, terror, and **killing**. 2) Do you have double standards? I give the benefit that you do not. Then whether nyjcmememachine is run by your friends or not does not matter. 3) Is it a ‘joke’? To us tech-savvy people who see memes everyday, maybe. **But what about those who do not know what meme culture is?** Would it be a joke to them, or a statement?

I think the conclusion on whether reporting was justified is pretty clear. You are of course free to rebut if you think my argument or assessment is unsound somewhere.
I upvoted you because you gave a reasonable reason for using the vote system yet got downvoted because people didn’t agree with you.

looking through this whole thread it’s pretty obvious who are the real edgy teenagers with little critical thinking skills and interpersonal relationship skills ITT now LUL. no wonder they hide behind keyboards and digital screens on reddit because they can’t criticise properly to justify their downvotes.

cheers to you, apparently reddit culture is too edgy for us. this whole thread is the real meme lul.
You need to understand that is a meme. Think of it like a online comedian that is making racist and sexist jokes. Obviously those who attend know the truth of the matter in the real word, but they know better than to think the comedian is advocating for it. Discernment is key.

&amp;#x200B;

 If anything, I am advocating for truth about how it is Islam's worldview.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;
I think I mentioned that a meme is simply a form of transference of ideas. Other forms include comedian, like you mentioned, newspapers, blogs and vlogs. It is not the form that is dangerous, but the ideas.

If an online comedian made a racist 'joke' about killing people, would you not be alarmed? I'm sure at least the police would want to have a chat with them. Same for videos or blogs, and of course, meme accounts.

I agree that discernment is key. But once again, not everyone has enough information to discern properly. We, who can discern between serious assertions and light-heartened jokes, are not *everyone* that can view these online media. For example, in this generation, parents tend to keep their children occupied with phones and tablets. What if these children stumble upon horrific videos or memes? I realize that this particular meme in question requires you to have knowledge of the atrocity of 9/11, so it is not very applicable to children. Then we consider another group of audience, people who are already on the verge of being radicalised. These people might just need that slight push from the meme.

You need to understand that not everyone **and absolutely everyone** has the same knowledge, education, information, and morals that we do. Terrorism just needs one person, *one* person that thinks terrorism is okay, whether it is through meme or comedians, to instill fear and cause injury and death.

I do not understand your last sentence, because I do not know what Islam's worldview is, so I can't argue against you on this point. I apologize for my lack of knowledge here.
As you agreed, discernment is key. I would discern and look at the context which the comedian made such jokes and gather enough evidence before escalating it to the authorities.

Ideas are like a double-edged sword, good or bad, it must surface and people must battle against bad ideas. I think the meme was distastefully made but if it opens the door for discussion about the religious ideas behind it, some good may come forth and more would be informed. Perhaps if you were, you would understand the meme better and understand the outcome would only hush the harsh reality that society should face or accept the eventual consequences (if any).

Food for thought since it seems serious enough to you, how many cases of terrorist attacks surfaced from memes?
I agree that ideas are a double-edged sword. What religious idea did it open for discussion? Perhaps it is good that such an event happened, so that people are informed that making memes about terrorism are no joke (unless you disagree that it is acceptable to make terrorism jokes).

Sorry, if I were what? What outcome, and what harsh reality? This sentence is too vague to argue against.

As for how many cases, I do not know. But does the number matter? Does it matter if it happened 0, 1, or 100 times? Likewise, how many bombing cases have happened in Singapore? Honestly, I don’t know either. But I think we agree that 0 bombings does not mean that we should not take precaution against bombers. That is why the police urge us to be vigilant for unattended belongings. Why do we wait for an debilitating event to happen first before taking precaution? We shouldn’t. Terrorist attacks influenced by memes may not have happened yet, but we should still take precaution against it. The lack of a precedent does not mean we should let our guard down. This is the reason why 9/11 was such a devastating attack—it was **the** precedent (I think) for terrorism on such a large scale, and on a developed country that was USA.
Welcome to the internet. Somewhere out there (in conversations, other forums) it will be discussed. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you understood the balance of it being a meme and truth behind it as well. Not trying to argue here.

&amp;#x200B;

Singapore **is**  taking precautions, and this would be a good opportunity to catch dangerous persons. There is still good to come out of it.
Once again, whether it is a meme or not **does not matter**... If you meant “...being a joke and truth...”, then it is a very bad joke in very bad taste, so bad that I wouldn’t even consider it a joke at all because **terrorism is not a joke**.

So why are people bashing the undergraduate for reporting it to the police? He raised the issue to the police’s attention, and the police are investigating to take precautions, no?
Once again, I mentioned that the meme was distastefully made. It does matter that it is a meme because it means something to choose it as a method of delivery.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps they want to suppress the truth in it and because people react differently. It then became viral for better or for worse.
What is that ‘something’ that vlogs, blogs, newspapers do not have?

I still don’t understand what is this ‘truth’ you are talking about so I can’t argue against that.
I would not go as far down as resort to insults and assumptions though. I'm just a little dismayed that maybe with the increased popularity of /r/singapore, the quality of submissions and general etiquette has decreased. But I guess that's normal for a site like reddit.
Spontaneity would be one.
Not really sure which definition you are using. From google:

“performed or occurring as a result of a sudden impulse or inclination and without premeditation or external stimulus.” Not this because memes don’t come out from nowhere, people have a purpose when creating memes, e.g. for laughs.

“having an open, natural, and uninhibited manner.” Newspaper are regulated so sure, but blogs and vlogs satisfy this condition too.

“(of a process or event) occurring without apparent external cause.” Same(?) as the first one I guess?
Auto-correct got me. I mean that memes convey a short message and it has a quicker outreach on the internet.
Doesn't that all the more prove that we should clamp down on and be more strict against such memes that could contain malicious messages?
That message - through use of meme - was not malicious. The intent should be quite obvious.
The agree that the intent wasn’t malicious, but I argue that the message was. If the message was taken at face value, is it not advocating violence? Also not really sure why you keep hanging on to it being a meme as an important detail.
Because I am trying to show you that a meme is typically humorous in nature and no sane person in the right mind would take it as an advocate for violence. How you can't grasp that point confounds me and I don't intend on doing this any longer if so.
The same for me: How you can't grasp that a meme is **typically** and thus **not always** humorous in nature  You even admitted it yourself: no **sane** person. So you are just going to ignore all the **less-than-sane** people out there who could be radicalized...?
Because context! I think I understand why you got down-voted now. Take care.
The context is **there indeed exists less-than-sane people out there who can view the meme in question, because this meme is visible to anyone and everyone who has access to instagram (instagram is free, account was also public), you cannot ensure that everyone who can view it is sane**, so the undergraduate reporting it to police was justified. I think you misidentify the context as well, unless you can propose another reasonable context or disqualify mine. ‘All’ is also a very powerful word. If you have taken part in debates, or taken General Paper, or done any mathematical proving, you would know the word ‘all’ isn’t thrown around so carelessly.

Nevertheless, thanks for your time to have a rational discussion about this, unlike all the other cowardly keyboard warriors who downvote just because they disagree or lack critical thinking skills (which is why they actually downvoted). You have a great day too! :)

I agree that truth should not be censored.

I think this is similar to point one.
You need to understand that is a meme.
Racism may not warrant a police report, but that does not mean terrorism does not warrant a police report.

I think I understand why you got down-voted now.
Just because it is a meme?
Terrorism is a form of hate.
Once again, whether it is a meme or not **does not matter**...
If your friend made the claim, would you?
If an online comedian made a racist 'joke' about killing people, would you not be alarmed?
But the meme was ‘Just do it’.
I agree that ideas are a double-edged sword.
On this point I agree with you.

What if it's a racist meme, then we shouldn't censor it?
