Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Hello fellow insomia victim
You need to nut, my man.
Your body can learn to cope with regular lack of sleep.

It's when you have irregular sleep that you're prone to being the most exhausted.

For example, let's say you have to work from 1am to 9am on Day 3 but are off work on Day 1 and Day 2. Day 3 is going to absolutely suck for you since you have to be awake during daylight hours on Day 1 and Day 2 to take care of regular business hours shit.

If you're awake on the morning or afternoon of Day 3 that's when you can be in the most danger, with all things being equal.

The human body's pretty cool.
Unironcially tho just go for a longish run and then you’ll feel tired and shleep, or perhaps a hot bath. Or maybe ask Francis ngannou to uppercut you. There are solutions!
remove the blue light
I think anytime someone asks for advice here at least one person suggests ejaculation
Alternately have a friend fucking hit you with their car
r/mma keeping it real.
Just fuck my shit up
Isn’t that what turbothot suggested though?
that's the joke
