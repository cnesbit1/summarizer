Just to let people know. Canberra block 105 coffeeshop, malay auntie sell superb bagus curry potato puffs and sardine puffs at $1.20 each. Big and well stuffed, very nice. Used to operate at old Woodland bus interchange but relocated. If you stay around the area can come buy, super worth it. 👍🏻👌🏻
Off topic a bit, anyone else that doesn't really like curry puff?

I see so many people who love curry puffs and idk why

I did grow up eating it because either my mum makes them or we buy them from somewhere but I only ate them cause I was hungry or wanted to please my mum.

I've always felt it tasted funky and left a gross aftertaste that I need tons of water to get rid of.
Are you eating the old chang kee kind of curry puff? I hate that kind of curry puff too because the crust is too thick and dry.

The best kind of curry puff is the type with thin and slightly crispy skin, usually sold by mamak shops and malay snack or food stalls.
curry puffs are our cornish pasties, i low ses so i love them a lot
curry puffs are amazing

Okay lah maybe I don't like the chang kee curry puff. That one feels too doughy to me. 

I like the flaky flaky kind that crumbles when you bite into it, I don't mind those.
Yeah I've never really liked the old Chang kee kind but the rest of my family do so they always buy them for me lol

I do like the normal, flaky kind that's more like crispy toast rather than some doughy bread

yet that's a high ses comparison
Many years ago the ock puff had generous filling where your could bite  into small chunks of chicken with every bite, the skin was good enough to eat on its own, and they cost less than a dollar.

the type you like is usually referred to as epok epok, nt curry puff
i learned of cornish pasties from reading harry potter eh
Wow your mom made curry puffs for your after school snack. I am thinking high ses you cra
Lol my grandmother comes and makes them sometimes and now and then as a treat my mom would make homemade ones. 

They were better than the old chang kee ones for sure though
