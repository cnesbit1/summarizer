I feel like I can smell the beginnings of the realization of a bottom and disbelief return of a bull market.  Perhaps this year will end with the believers and holders proven Right.  Frankly, we deserve it.

I agree. School has indeed been in session. 
I suspect momentum will take time, but I've always preferred and steady and Bitcoin gains with support rather than December 2017 action.

But inevitably the insanity of December 2017 and the 2014 bullish insanity will happen again.

During this time there will be lots reasons why we should sell Bitcoin for some alt coin. Dont fall for it.
I'm thinking we are going to get another ATH by end of this year, or early into next such as what happened in 2013.  There were two breaks ATH's that year i think
I certainly wont be complaining if that happens:)

And yesterdays sudden price drop, then immediately  spike upwards of several hundred dollars all within 5 minutes is a stark reminder of easily large price moves can happen.
Unlikely but that would be incredible. That would mean going to ~100K USD by the end of the year and dropping back to ~18K in the following years.
the pattern of volatility will be affected with the amount of new users added to the network in coming hype period. 2017 is when media started to pay attention. Single article about a country banning btc moved the price. Single big firm press conference had a massive impact. Then in Q1 2018 when 'everybody' was jumping ship, there were not many people around to tell you. This time we will have 2017 survivors.

I think we are going to see a very strong network effect this very cycle (Q4 2018 - Q12019) and things will be very different from now.

tl;dr - bitcoin will not volatile forever, adoption is not going to be linear.
Then it it won't happen, the market does what hurts the most people.
haven't we been hurt enough?  If we go down to 3k that would bring on the most pain
Try 1k, we have to kill off all the shitcoins

Summary:
Then it it won't happen, the market does what hurts the most people.
