Don’t expect r/conspiracy to suddenly suckle the nipple of MSM. 

And censorship of opposing views is far more important than bashing another puppet politician.

Ha! All the media does is circle jerk about Trump. 

I looked for BuzzFeeds investigative reporting on all the suspicious financial transactions around 9/11, they must have had the day off for that one... but muh Russia!
so to be clear, you’re taking issue with a news publication founded in 2011 not doing enough to look into a story related to an event that happened a decade before that company existed?

An event that’s big news every year, and still has millions of people asking questions. 

Maybe the co-founder did the digging during his time at HuffPo? Nope, not there either.
Hi five your buddies for the big win! 

The whole Russia nonsense is about the same thing the illegal invasion of Iraq was about. Never mind all the foreign money and influence that’s been corrupting the US government for decades, muh Russia...

This is a legitimate piece of investigative reporting and Buzzfeed News is a legitimate news org. I’ve just pointed out the credentials of the authors. 

I’m doing it because I knew that despite all those credentials, and despite Buzzfeed and Buzzfeed news being separate entities, people would treat “Buzzfeed lol” as a legitimate talking point. 

I honestly don’t know if it’s because people want to sweep this stuff under the rug while knowing full well that the article is credible or if they’re just ignorant of the fact. I just want to provide relevant information for people in that second group so they know that this is legit investigative journalism and not like the listicles or pop culture stuff Buzzfeed (not Buzzfeed news) publishes
If only we could get the daily caller to report it and some random whack jobs on YouTube to make a 14 min long video talking over photos.  Then we would gain some traction
The sad state of affairs, knowing nothing other than what you’re told to believe. 

Believing what I learn, compared to believing what you’re told to believe. Oh the irony...
Get the guy on YouTube who doesn’t own any shirts to report it!

You’d be surprised what you can learn when you go to the source rather than the interpretation you’re given. Give it a shot.

Not sure if you know this, but past comments are easy to view. No need to assume when you wear it on your sleeve.

I could ask you the same thing. 

It seems clear why you come to this sub, no interest in conspiracy just looking to berate people. I know, I’m the a-hole for calling it out.

Buzzfeed is fake, biased news.

Pretty telling that you feel berated when the MSM is attacked.

I think LITERAL corruption with a paper trail is actually way more important than a private company banning a sub
People dont have the attention span for things like financial crimes. Why the fuck is the dossier called the 'piss tape'? Peeing is literally the least important part of that thing
You expect these people to be able to put two spoonfed talking points together? They dont know the history, they just get an emailed memo of talking points and responses, they arent connecting ideas
What sources would you recommend?
All of them, and none of them.
Let’s be real, this censorship is not isolated and ironically has one goal in common with Russiagate - election interference. 

I’m looking forward to seeing the paper trail, but it won’t matter. Partisans will be partisan and meanwhile something that matters, like censorship of opposition, goes on; and is even supported. 

Looking forward to the time we can’t talk about the paper trail on internet forums.
