If you want to try to stay with your boyfriend, you should cancel to be honest. You've had plenty of time to rationalize and come to terms with your cheating but to your boyfriend it's still fresh and he has every reason not to trust you right now. You should be focusing on regaining his trust and fixing your relationship.

None of that changes my response. You should still cancel your trip unless you are okay with being single when you return.

You're really prioritizing this trip over his feelings. After you cheated on him and lied for years. Don't know why you posted here if you were determined to go regardless of what he or anyone else thinks.

I don't know what you're expecting.

He says that now. Before you're gone for however long. He will be thinking you have done something or are doing something the entire trip. it doesn't matter what you talk about now. Being apart at such a bad time is going to fuck your relationship up. You will be single when you get home. 100%.
No you don't. You want to go on the trip and you want all of us to say its okay so you can show him and he'll feel better about it. Anytime anyone, which is everyone, says not to go you just give excuses on why you should. Grow up.

Summary:
You should still cancel your trip unless you are okay with being single when you return.
You're really prioritizing this trip over his feelings.
