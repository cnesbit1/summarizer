Hey Peeps,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm interested in MTL vaping right now and have chosen my RDA to use (Berserker from Vandy Vape).  I am asking what kind of juice is best for MTL setup.  I currently vape 9mg on RDA's and 50mg Salt in pods.

&amp;#x200B;

Can I use the same 50mg salt in this setup and expect similar effect,  should I use a higher freebase nic (like 12 or 18mg), or would a 6mg salt be better?

&amp;#x200B;

Please and Thank You.
I vape 6mg DL and 18mg freebase has worked for me. 25mg salt however has done me well for rebuildables. Above that is too much for me personally.
I'll second those numbers.. well, 3mg for a crazy build RDA / 6mg regular RDA or RTA / 18mg for MTL. I don't like salts, though. I MTL for the throat hit.
Agreed on the throat hit. I get enough with the salt but not the perfect amount of throat hit.

I agree that 25mg or under for salts would be a good place to start. When I got my Berserker Mini, I got a bottle of 45mg salt and if I get it just right I actually lose my breath a bit and have to take a few deep inhales before continuing. That could be completely different for you though. With pod systems, I always used 45-50mg with no troubles, so it may be a bit more of a jump than expected.
Pod systems definitely use higher for me too. And yeah, anything higher than 25mg and I have difficulty breathing so I stay around there haha
It honestly scared me the first time it happened. Haven't felt that way in a long time lol.
Same dude!! It almost turned me off of salts lol
That would have been a shame. It only happens to me when I have my power turned up over 16w instead of the normal 12-13w that I tend to run at. (.75 ohms) I just learned not to increase power and to just increase draw time if I want a bit more of a hit.
Yeah I tried 35mg at 25 watts lol probably a bad idea lol

Summary:
I MTL for the throat hit.
I don't like salts, though.
