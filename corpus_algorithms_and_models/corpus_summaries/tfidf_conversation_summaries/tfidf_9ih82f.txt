I’m not driving it. I need a new transmission. And no, I’m not using Uber, I’m jus saying I’d be on-board with someone having a service that circumvents rental cars entirely in favor of a one-time use vehicle where the only major points are that you must have a valid license and you must drop the car to the next person with a full tank of gas.
