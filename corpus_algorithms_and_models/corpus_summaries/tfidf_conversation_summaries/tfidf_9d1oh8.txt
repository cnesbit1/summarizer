That’s -beautiful- great job. How do those tires feel at freeway speeds? Truly stunning bike.
Lol this bike hasn’t ever been rode above 5mph since the new owner got it
'i dont like it so the person who built it isnt a *real* rider'. surprised you could type with your head so far up your arse
You can literally see that there’s basically no tire wear...
photo couldve been taken straight after it was finished, or new tires...
Good investigation skills
Other than the seat it’s a good looking bike, it’s just really obvious that a guy that has a bike that’s so nonfunctional wouldn’t ride the bike.

The comment you replied to is still literally true.
correct there is no tire wear but that doesnt mean the owner has only ridden it 5 miles, he couldve ridden it 10,000 as far as we know
