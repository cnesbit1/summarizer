Promises Victoria Police that an ABF joint operation won't involve racial profiling, in the middle of Victoria Police trying to rectify a highly embarrassing and damaging racial profiling problem, then instructs ABF officers to racially profile.

Opining and handwringing over abuses he was in a position to publicly document and frankly prevent now that he's safely out on his arse after a long publicly funded holiday whilst he's corrupt behaviour slowly ended his job would also fit the bill.

We all remember the famous moment when the ABF, to compensate for their nonexistent masculinity, stormed Melbourne in SWAT gear and accosted random (brown) citizens for their papers, leaving aside that there is no legal requirement to carry ID or so on.
