Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

[Bloody Elbow Comment Section](https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2018/9/9/17839140/ufc-mma-video-snoop-dogg-woodley-till-wakanda-228-welterweight-rapper-dart-choke) doing mental gymnastics to make snoop dogg's Woodley v. Till reaction not racist.    


Audrey Stone (a Mod) casually dropping racists memes.  (It's okay, because it's anti-white male).
The insinuation that Snoop thought Till was Covington is definitely a lie, he calls him “the gorilla” in the very beginning of the video
why are you posting about the comments section of a different site
Why not?
You'll figure it out.
Because this is a general discussion thread. Why discuss anything? Let’s all get off reddit.
Yeah also if any white person slightly mispronounces a black fighters name they are imperial wizards let alone confuses the actual identity of two black fighters. Complete double standard.
Even if he did think Till was Covington, that doesn’t change the message he’s pushing at all. It’s still racist. I don’t get how that would change anything one bit.
I just find it hilarious because Snoop obviously thinks Till is Colby - hence the "fuck Donald Trump" outbursts.

I don't know why Dana ever wanted Snoop associated with the company.
because who cares

I guarantee people care more about that comment than they do yours

damn dude that hurts
Till was introduced before the fight with his nickname. Snoop definitely though Till was Covington. Just confused one white guy for another
I literally do not understand mixing them up

it'd be similar to mixing up big nog and Rua cause they're both Brazilian

like, they're kinda the same size, I ***guess***
He thought Till was the one that went to the White House.
Casual fan.  Very easy to mix them up
