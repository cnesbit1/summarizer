Original Response:
Hey Everyone! As yall may or may not now I often have a pretty good access to most serial codes here in North America. With that said, most of the time I find myself with tons of extra codes. Sometimes I can get rid of em, sometimes I can't so rather than keep them to myself for  128460186 years, I'm gonna giveaway codes for 5 days. Each day will have 10 new codes (: Make sure to let us all know in the thread which code you got! Thank you. Have a wonderful day/night! ðŸ’›


10 KG Codes:

* 1. ~~A852NGSJPJMT6XUQ~~
* 2. ~~A852NGS6EMFA2U59~~
* 3. ~~A852NGP6X6T3P4PQ~~
* 4. ~~A852NGNCRWYG7QNY~~
