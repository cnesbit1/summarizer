Original Response:
we definitely need a backstory... display piece? built in the appartment? winter storage plan?
My cousin started his ride home from work a couple days ago and only made it about 400 feet before his bike broke down. Turns out someone had walked by and cut his fuel lines during the day while he was parked on the street. 

The spot where he broke down just happened to be within reach of the tower crane we have on our construction project so we rigged it up with two round slings to load into his truck.
this looks familiar... [https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/9j2zjr/cut\_fuel\_lines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/9j2zjr/cut_fuel_lines/)

though ramps are infinitely easier
Yea that's me, haha
I respectfully beg to differ unless youâ€™re taking in to account running 480amp temp power service, a week of rebar matt install, 88 yards of concrete, 4 semi truck loads of parts, 2 mobile cranes, 14 union iron workers on the erection crew and a certification from a 3rd party crane inspection company.
ramps into truck bed: single person operation. 10 seconds prep time (put ramp on bed and tie it down) 30 second load time. 

craning the bike: minimum 2 person (crane operator and the guy on the rope). rotate crane etc. rig. raise. remove rigging. had to have taken at least 10 minutes.
Why would anyone do that? What a dick move. 

Edit: Talkin' bout the guy who cut the fuel lines.
Yeah, but this is cooler. Besides, how else are you gonna kill time during your day?
For ultimate style points, put the thing on the roof of something. or some other place where there's no way it could get to otherwise. take pics. then put it back in the truck.
Some people are just really, really shitty. Maybe they grew up in an awful environment and failed to learn how to act decently. It's hard to condemn someone without having lived their life.

But also, fuck that guy
I don't get it man. You'd think that people who have been hurt would be more against hurting others because they know what it's like. 

It'd be tough for me to hurt someone who deserved it, let alone someone who didn't.

Summary:
