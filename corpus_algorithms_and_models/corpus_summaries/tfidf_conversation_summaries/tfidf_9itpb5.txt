UFC used to have non title main events all the time. Just do Dustin vs Nate if that’s all ya got
Yea but I feel like if we allow them to start selling us PPVs without title fights, we are going to start getting PPVs every other week and they are going to be shitty cards. I would rather them hold the PPVs to the highest standard so they at least have some value to them.

My opinion is if they can't get a title fight in time, scrap the card or make Nate vs Dustin the main event and put it on FS1.
They would never do that. Nate is too big for FS1 now.
That was before they were $65 and selling less tho
And it was waaaay before all the “free” fight night cards. They only used to do 3-4 free cards a year aside from the PPVs.
Nate is "too big" because of his own ego. He is a gate keeper lightweight at best. Yea, he won over Conor on a short notice fight and that is his only ticket to stardom. I am not discrediting him as a fighter but obviously his ego is way higher than what the UFC credits him for before they are making him take other fights before they line up that Conor trilogy.
Think he means Nate’s a needle mover.
What was the last non title main event besides a conor event?
Both of Romero's fights this year.
Lmao
Damn. True. So his fight against Kelvin will be his first title defense.

Summary:
UFC used to have non title main events all the time.
Nate is too big for FS1 now.
