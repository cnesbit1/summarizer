&gt; I don't know how to leave

is a direct consequence of 

&gt; all he's done for 5 years is call me stupid , a dumbass , useless and worthless and now I don't want to live at this point.

You are not stupid. He puts you down because he wants you to have low self-esteem so you don't leave him.

That said: Leave ASAP. It will be like ripping off a band-aid. And suddenly one day in a few months you will wake up with a smile on your face, feeling like you came out of a five year fog, realizing that you are good, smart person who is absolutely worthy of love.

Seriously? I know I’m going to be told to not feed the trolls but what is the point of you taking the time to post this nonsense? To speak what is really on your mind or just to bring other people down to your level of misery? While you took the time to point out OP’s supposed stupidity, you just revealed your own level of insecurity. But hopefully if she reads your comment she can use it as practice for the hatred that her boyfriend is spewing at her now. Abusive relationships are pure hell and I’m honestly thankful that apparently you’ve never been in one or else you would not be saying such vile things.

You are falling into the trap of thinking mean awful thinks are somehow more truthful. 

There is plenty of research out there talking about the dynamics of abuse and how it works. No matter how you say it, you're just factually wrong. 'Trauma bonding' is a good concept to read about if you want to actually understand how these relationships work.

Please educate yourself about abusive relationships. Abusers employ very specific and powerful tactics in order to make their victim complicit. It's not that simple a situation as you make it to be.

Please strife to be better human being. Try to understand more and help more. Do not be a collaborator to these vile monsters.

No, power is not always given over. It can also just be taken. In the case of abuse it is seized via a careful continuous process which takes years. It establishes new norms inside the victims mind via a step by step worsening of the situation. In the end the victim is accustomed to the abuse which makes it hard to leave it behind. You can compare it to an addiction. Do you also think that addictions don't exist? 

Only because you never suffered from severe manipulation tactics does not mean they don't exist.

You do not empower people by calling them weak and stupid. You put them down. If you really want to help, you have to educate yourself more. Please read some books on the matter. And have an open mind while doing so.
Your worldview is really simplistic. 

Trust me, therapy for abuse victims does not sugarcoat anything. And it is incredibly hard. You are just in over your head here.

&gt; No, I'm saying it can't force you to stay. At most it can give you negative emotions and thoughts if you believe it. But it cannot make you stay. You choose to stay when you allow your emotions to dictate your behavior.

Only a prison with metal bars can jail people then? Your state of mind is made from your past. You can not just decide to be someone completely different. That's not how humans work. If you have been trained, over several years, to behave in a certain way, you will behave that way. Your character and your past define who you are.

You are not as free as you think you are.

&gt; This sentence alone tells me you're dishonest and ashamed of them. Even many abuse victims have admitted that they stayed for financial support or to avoid lonliness. The list goes on. Now you're calling them liars just to elevate your own agenda.

Don't twist my words. Victims of abuse do sometimes give these reasons. But that does not make them real or the major factor. The situation is far more complex.

&gt; Yes. The high...The escapism is the benefit. That's literally why they do it...Do you even know what 'benefit' means? Do you even know what "victim blaming" means?

They can not stop by themselves. Even you, as strong as you may be, could not stop. Chemical processes in your brain can control you. There is no infinitely detached free spirit inside you that can always rationally choose a way to act.

Aside from all this, you completely miss the point of all this. The question is: "How do you help people in these bad situations?"

The answer by experts, people who devoted their life to these problems, who, in many cases, lived through it themselves and have seen hundreds of cases going bad or good, tell you how to do it:

"Respect"

Respect the shit out of these people. So that they can start respecting themselves again. You are advocating for the complete opposite. And your method will deteriorate the situation immensely.
