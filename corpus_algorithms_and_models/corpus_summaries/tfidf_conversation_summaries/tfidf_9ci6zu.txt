Original Response:
[event] I recently found out about these event distributions and I missed out on most of them, so I'm looking to get the pokes that are required to catch others in the game. I want Palkia ~~and Tornadus~~  the most, then if there's anyone with Zekrom, Entei, Lugia, or Regigigas those would be cool to get. I have:

~~lvl 1 ash hat pikachu - self-redeemed, OT Ash, ID 090898~~ claimed!

lvl 60 event kyogre - self-redeemed, OT 2018 Legends, ID 080318

lvl 60 event yveltal - self-redeemed, OT 2018 Legends, ID 050418

and the following wormhole shinies:

abomasnow #1 - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

abomasnow #2 -  self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

floatzel #1 - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

floatzel #2 - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

siglyph - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

shiftry - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

quagsire - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

audino - self-obtained, OT Dan, ID 967506

I know the shinies I have aren't that rare but it's all I've got ðŸ˜… Time zone is PST but I'll be available for the next few hours.
I have a zygarde code and a couple k/g codes but I'm assuming you have those?
I actually don't have zygarde. What are you looking to get for it?
I'd probably do it for the ash hat pika if you're down.
Absolutely! I should warn you this is my first trade since like gen IV so I might be a little slow haha.
It's ok... I'll be home in just over an hour is that ok... I don't have the code on me

Running a tad late.. I'll be home soon

Summary:
