#Greetings and good evening! (“⌒∇⌒”)



#[Spreadsheet Here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f2Cc7OuF2HHVO3Qx0Y1NxBilEDGPShCWz7M7NGeMXDs/edit#gid=1742730302)


###What I'm after in this here post: 

* **Looking for a variety of trades:**
* Codes for Custom Shinies, Comp Shinies, and Events.
* Events for Events.
* Shiny for Shiny. 
* I decided I am now on the hunt for all of the Vivillon patterns with *competitive* spreads (31/x/31/31/31/31, Timid nature) and matching ball's; preferably Apri. I'd like 2 of each, one with HA and one with regular ability. I'll offer up NA codes and trophy shinies for those (might consider semi-comp shinies). May also be willing to take up some breedable requests as well. Rates will vary depending on the offer that is given. (I'd prefer these in eggs so I can hatch them with my OT.)
* Vivillon pattern's still needed: Archipelago, Sandstorm, ~~Savanna~~, ~~Icy Snow~~, Garden, Jungle, Meadow, ~~Marine~~, River, and ~~Sun~~.

#####Event's I'm currently on the hunt for:

* Any Diancie events
* Any Pikachu events
* Any Mew events
* Steven's Beldum
* XY Torchic
* Fancy Vivillon
* Serena's Fennekin and Pancham
* PC Bewear
* Worlds Exeggutor
* Movie Zeraora 
* Pop-Up store Manaphy
* VGC Krookodile
* 2018 Tanabata Jirachi
* Worlds Meloetta
* WCSK Metagross
* Anything that I may not have in my events collection


#Current Code Stock:

Code | Stock 
:-: | :-: |
NA Thundurus/Tornadus | 48
NA Latios/Latias | 2
NA Shiny Poipole | 17

#Disclaimers:

* Event offer's will take priority.
* I'm only interested in competitive shiny Pokemon.
* "Events Collection" tab is strictly NFT.
* I probably won't be interested in JKSM events, non-beneficial nature events, and events with no proof. 
* If custom shinies are RNG'd, they must be hatched through /r/SVExchange. I don't prefer custom's to be hatched through me or the person doing them. Just a little quirk I have.
* Not interested in any 2018 Legends events.
Hi, I have modern pattern scatterbug, and have access to all scatterbug apricorn combos.  I can also breed custom shinies, either to your TSV or I can get them hatched on SVE.  I am looking for NA Poipole codes.

Eggs will be RNG'd with Pcalc on my CFW 3DS.
Whoops, I actually already have Modern.

But if you were wanting to do custom shinies, I have a small list on my sheet.

Let me know which one’s you’d be willing/can do and your rate.
I'm somewhat occupied right now &gt;_&lt; but I will have a look when I have time!  My rate is one code:one 6iv shiny or 2 codes: flawless HP shiny.
No worries.
I can do Baltoy off your list for 1 code if that works.  I can try the baby Pokemon, but because of how they work I'm uncertain as to how many codes they are worth and whether or not I will be able to get them done.
Just the Baltoy is fine. I'll set aside a code for you.c:
Hey, I'm just about ready to grab the egg.  Do you care if it has a name other than its English one?  (Many people on SVE have non-english saves)  It will still be ENG tagged since my game is ENG tagged.
No, it doesn’t matter to me.c:
Hey, I have your Baltoy!  [Hatch Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/comments/87loqa/1336/e68buw2/)

Rule 3:

Baltoy | Shiny | Relaxed | 31/31/31/31/31/0 | RNG'd with Pcalc | Hatched on SVExchange | OT/ID: 루나/089635 | Egg RNG'd on checkpoint managed save

Edit: I'm so sorry but I forgot to mention I play on checkpoint managed saves...if this is a problem please let me know and I will try and resolve it.
Hey, no worries.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll  be around for the day to trade.
Okay, I can trade now if that works!
I'll add you and hop on in about 10 minutes.c:
I'll be waiting on the plaza, send trade request whenever you're ready!
Heading to Plaza now. Will send the code through PM once we're in trade.
Pokemon sent, code received!  Thank you :D
You're welcome, and thank you as well!

Summary:
Hey, I have your Baltoy!
I am looking for NA Poipole codes.
* I'm only interested in competitive shiny Pokemon.
I can do Baltoy off your list for 1 code if that works.
