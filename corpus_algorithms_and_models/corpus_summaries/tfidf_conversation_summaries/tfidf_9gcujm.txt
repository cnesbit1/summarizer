Since metagross is one of my favourite pkmn, I really would like to have one of these. Here is my spreadsheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dM-yq\_l8jrLZ0ZfMDc7w74lGH4Qf9o1DbIM0XUPkplY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dM-yq_l8jrLZ0ZfMDc7w74lGH4Qf9o1DbIM0XUPkplY/edit#gid=0)

I have some zeraoras OT:フウラシティ ID: 180713 with Jolly (from user  [**u/YosukeZ**](https://www.reddit.com/user/YosukeZ/) ), Adamant or Naive (both from  [**u/bebepupupu**](https://www.reddit.com/user/bebepupupu/) ) natures and they com with proof. I have a self-obtained Lati@s set unredeemed in SUMO from the Legends2018 event in september (will come with OT "Leyendas2018" since it is in spanish) that i can SR to get custom natures. Also since I am in NA right now I will be able to get some Poipole codes.

Hello,

While it is great that you are asking for the Rule 3 details yourself, please **also** report rule-breaking offers to the moderators, as we need to be aware of them.
&gt; if youre looking for event pokemon i have mcdonalds hoopa and a hope diancie, im just looking for a poiple code

In the future, you need to disclose all of the required information (Rule 3) when offering.

Please read our [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) before posting.

Summary:
I will get the codes tomorrow.
