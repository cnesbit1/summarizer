Submission Statement: It looks like the Russia investigation is creeping up into exposing a lot of the shady dealings that the global elite like to do when they think nobody is looking:

&gt;By collecting such detailed banking records, US law enforcement officials are trying to figure out how Russia’s interference campaign was financed — but in doing so, they are also pulling back the curtain on an opaque financial system controlled by the world’s wealthiest people.

The bit about Agalarov's account laying dormant with the $200 it was opened with for a year reminds me of the heist from a few years ago that was eventually traced to North Korea. The timing is all very clearly planned ahead of time, but there are limitations here because the money is going through people who are already being looked out:

&gt;Between July 2015 and January 2017, Oui 2 received more than half a million dollars from Corsy International. Bank examiners found this suspicious because Corsy was an import-export business, while Oui 2 was involved with music. It didn’t make sense, bankers reported, for these two companies to conduct transactions with one another.

It's some real spy thriller shit going on, and frankly I can't wait to see how the dominos fall. It'll probably be a while, these guys know how to keep their mouths shut.
Haha Muh Russia? Really?
Well that's hardly an argument.
I thought everyone here realized that this was a bullshit conspiracy theory pushed by the Deep State and mainstream media by now...
You’re right, let’s focus on Muh Emails instead...
No, that's just something people say to sound smart and avoid admitting that they could ever be wrong.
LOL ok keep on believing CNN bud, just don't be surprised if you get laughed at. You could just take it to r/politics or r/news or some other hivemind sub, I'm sure you'd get a good reception there.
CNN has nothing to do with this but thank you for showing you have no substantive argument at all.
You're  right, it was even worse than CNN because you posted a buzzfeed article.  Lol. 
  
If a website is almost always attempting to shape their readers mindset and outlook, why would this one time be an exception to the agenda/matrix?
Buzzfeed isn't Buzzfeed News. Of course, you're well aware of this, but because you have no argument about the actual material, you have to revert to this garbage ad hominem.
&gt;The first set came just **11 days** after the June 9 meeting, when an offshore company controlled by Agalarov wired more than $19.5 million to his account at a bank in New York

Sounds like Buzzfeed and Mueller team are desperate. 11 days? 

&gt;The second flurry began shortly after Trump was elected. The Agalarov family started sending what would amount to $1.2 million from their bank in Russia to an account in New Jersey controlled by the billionaire’s son, pop singer Emin Agalarov, and two of his friends. The account had been virtually dormant since the summer of 2015, according to records reviewed by BuzzFeed News, and **bankers found it strange that activity in Emin Agalarov’s checking account surged after Trump’s victory**.

LOL this proves nothing, it's just more BS justification to continue the Bogus investigation. 

&gt;Scott Balber, an attorney representing the Agalarovs and Kaveladze, said their transactions were wholly above board. **“I’m actually perplexed why anybody is interested in this or why anybody in their right mind would treat this as suspicious,”** he said. “**These are all transactions either between one of Mr. Agalarov’s accounts and another of Mr. Agalarov’s accounts or one of Mr. Agalarov’s accounts and an account in the name of one of his employees**.”

Which is 100% legal. And NOT suspicious at all. 

&gt;**Suspicious activity reports are not evidence of wrongdoing**, but they can provide clues to investigators looking into possible money laundering, tax evasion, or other misconduct. In the case of the Agalarovs and their associates, bankers raised red flags about the transactions **but were unable to definitively say how the funds were used**.

Weasel Words, not surprising considering it's fucking Buzzfeed. No evidence of anything. 

Even their graphic is a fucking joke, he transferred money to himself. Fucking stupid article.

That bogus investigation that has convictions and guilty pleas? Come now, you know better than that.

Also I love how you expect people to ignore everything you didn't bold. Ooh, "man says he didn't commit crime" is enough then? "Bankers without full picture can't tell full story" is really that much of a shocker for you? I'm sure it's just a coincidence that more people in the Trump Tower meeting were suspiciously moving money around with pals who launder money.

**None of which relate to Russian collusion**.

You are so biased it's laughable. 

You WANT it to be real (Russian Collusion) But it's simply not. 

Trump was a victim of a coordinated effort by Obama, Obama DOJ and FBI to destroy the Executive Branch
and overturn a duly elected President. 

You do Realize Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS met with the Russian Lawyers the day before, and the day after the tower meeting right? 

You ignore reality and supplant your own. Just like Buzzfeed.
[hrmmmm, yes important. ](https://i.imgur.com/k15ub5o.jpg)

Ya know, I am sorry I didn't mean to come across as an ass. It just made me laugh. Conspiracy  + buzzfeed anything seems like an unwritten rule. Like, it was probably presented by another outlet that would get scoffed at leas of posted. Sorry, duder! Never my intention to implore the tactics of the unthinkers.
&gt;On June 3, 2016, Goldstone sent Donald Trump Jr. an email asking to get together. **Goldstone was explicit: A top Russian prosecutor had given Aras Agalarov damning information about Hillary Clinton — “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump,”** he wrote.

Strange how we keep seeing evidence of Russian agents working with Trump, but we've not seen a shred of evidence for this supposed victimization by the Obama administration.

Oh, the irony.
Removed. Rule 10

Also I love how you expect people to ignore everything you didn't bold.
