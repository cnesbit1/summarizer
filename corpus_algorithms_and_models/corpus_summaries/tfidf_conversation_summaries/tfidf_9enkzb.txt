Hello. We are DJs/Producers under the moniker Drop Team Epic and we are rave/convention DJs focusing primarily on anime/pop culture events. We just finished performing at Colossalcon East, an anime convention hosted at one of the largest indoor water parks in the world. We are stuck at the airport for the next 8 hours. Ask us anything about traveling and performing, rave music, production, or convention life.

What’s your all-time favorite anime show?
That's a tough one. Seasons move so fast that it's hard to really invest in a show. High Score Girl and Shoujo☆ Kageki Revue Starlight this season are really shaping up to be all time faves but for past shows it's probably be Madoka Magica, Trigun, and Love Live.
Are you indeed aware that Rei is best and Asuka is trash?
You really gonna trash the OG tsundere waifu like that? smdh

Trigun! Not one you see very often!

One of my faves too :D
Vash's juxtaposition in character traits is just so cool. The greatest living gunman who refuses to kill anybody. Show was such a wild ride. RIP Rem.
Misato or bust.
&gt; bust

She certainly has a bust, indeed.
Eyyyyy
Love and peace!!  (PLUR?)

Completely agree. I think that’s what makes the serious parts of the show hit so hard. He’s got this veneer of lightheartedness, when inside he’s given everything and has nothing left for himself. The first anime I ever cried over.

Seriously though, I haven’t come across you guys before.. are you on soundcloud by any chance? :) if not, where’s the best place to listen to some of your sets?

*edit: hoping this is you guys? https://soundcloud.com/dropteamepic/ramen-break-ramen-dream-5th-anniversary-drop-team-epic-mix
Of course we are, we didn't want to post it in the top post because we actually wanted to answer questions and not just come off as self shilling. But you can check out our rAmen Break Ramen Dream mix and two of our publicly released tracks at http://www.soundcloud.com/dropteamepic
