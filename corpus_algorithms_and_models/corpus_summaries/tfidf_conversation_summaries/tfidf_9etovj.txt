Original Response:
Now in pretty much every major religion, philosophy, and school of thought we have extremely intelligent people that have reached that conclusion. We have incredibly intelligent nihilists, pagans, Platonists, Muslims, Christians, atheists, agnostics, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, etc (sorry to the thousands of groups I missed). It seems that there doesn't appear to be a common ground that the most intelligent of us can find regarding these ideas.

So entertain with me for a few minutes the following hypothetical scenario: fifty or so years in the future we create a hyper-intelligent AI that is non-hostile and co-operative with humans, **and for the sake of this argument it does not lie** *(although I obviously have to allow the slight possibility it could be mistaken).* It can think so fast and in such great detail that it sits and figures out the theory of everything like it's nothing almost instantly after we ask it to. After the scientists, politicians, generals, and other parties most likely to be involved in its creation get to ask it all the questions they so desire, along come a few philosophers. They ask it the big questions regarding theory of mind, the existence of God, mathematical objects, and other such quandaries that consensus is hard to reach on (at least compared to say the scientific consensus on evolution). 

Now for this bit I'm going to use stereotypical views for atheists and theists, disregard the ones that don't apply to you personally:

**Now let's say for the theist:** it confirms and provides detailed evidence that materialism is true, that mathematics and logic are nominalist, that there is no evidence of God, that morality is not objective but a construct humans have created, it provides conclusive evidence that tears down the validity or soundness of any theistic argument, and essentially rips apart the foundations of your religious and philosophical views. Would you still believe based wholly on your faith in your religion?

**For the atheist:** In a bit of a turn from the more typical scenario above, let's assume that the hyperintelligent AI instead proves that all the major arguments for God are sound and valid, that Platonic realism is true, that dualism or idealism is true, that a certain religion (say one of the Abrahamic religions) is true, that morality isn't just objective but is the will of God, and submits itself to that religion. Would you follow this hyperintelligent AI in following this religion? Assuming of course it provides all the necessary working out that it made to reach its conclusions.

Much like today, people may look at the evidence provided by this hyperintelligent AI and continue to disagree with the conclusions it provides. Look at a lot of the discussions here. We constantly provide arguments, argue over which is right, and have intelligent people on both sides of the argument being consistent in their argumentation *(please don't attack this point, we have enough "haha ur argumntz dum" comments on this subreddit from both sides nowadays)*. 

**So here's the kicker:** what if this hyperintelligent AI used the same arguments for and against these concepts that we use in this subreddit on a daily basis? Would we be just in trusting its conclusions and lines of evidence because it can think on a level that surpasses even the collective intelligence of every human to have ever existed combined? Even though we did not find it satisfying when it came from an ordinary person?

I personally feel like, out of principle, I shouldn't accept the hyperintelligent AI's conclusions if it's using the same arguments people use today since then I'm trusting it almost purely on the authority of its superior mind. Yet I also feel like something of such intelligence would be foolhardy to disregard and not trust if it is being honest.

Thoughts?
