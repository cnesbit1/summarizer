Original Response:
And the defamation suit in 3...2...1.
She got him on audio admitting that he raped her. Any defamation suit would be of very little use.

Edit- sorry guys, I was remembering incorrectly. Here is a post from the r/exmormon subreddit where someone actually went through the transcript of the audio I referred to and shared what was admitted to. Apologies.

If there’s any group delusional enough to think the audio tape doesn’t matter, this would be it.
That won’t happen.  Discovery on this is the last thing the church wants.
Unfortunately in many states in admissible without permission of the person being recorded

I thought the older I got the more life would make sense...
He admitted all kinds of things in the recorded interview, but he consistently refused to admit to rape.
I dunno, if they just call it “locker room talk,” half the country will gobble it up.
Utah is a one party consent state, but there's an effort to pass a law requiring both parties to consent to recording supported by, of course, the LDS. https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900009626/bill-would-require-consent-to-record-a-conversation-in-utah.html

Utah is a single party consent state for audio recording.

It's admissible.

Her case based on the audio tape was already dismissed because of statute of limitations. She has one charge before the court regarding the church cover-up I think

It doesn't matter what the countries reaction is. We have a system of law in place for just this type of situation. She will probably use it and good for her. That's why it's there. 

Again though. The legal system works pretty darn well and if she has a case it will proceed.
Plenty men will admit to rape as long as you don’t call it that. They get offended when you call it that.

She did have a case. The judge...a Mormon, dismissed it because it of statutes of limitations. 

But for decades she tried to get help, even from police (who were also all Mormon). She tried to get help long before finally hiring a lawyer. 

There is still a case open against the Mormon church for covering it up. But I think I read they’re having a hard time getting any records of the abuse that she reported over and over and over.
