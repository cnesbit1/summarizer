Original Response:
It's not the nicotine. It's not the juice. Anytime I try to make these coils (5 wraps, 0.4 ohms), smoke between 20 and 60 watts, it burns. I can make Kanthal fine. I have SS 316L 22 AWG I can smoke at 55W. No issues. I feel like I'm completely missing out on flavor with these.

Wires are not overlapped. They're squeezed together. On the TFV8 if that helps.
5 wraps of 22G 316SS doesn't get you to 0.4 more like 0.15
It's a dual coil. Coil master puts new at 0.38, Aegis 0.37

Edit: and 0.15 in other wire combos doesn't burn at 55W
Something isn't right. Your numbers break physics.

Go to steam-engine.org, put in dual coil SS316, 22G, and 0.4ohms, 3mm diameter. Then look at the wraps. That's 26 wraps to get 0.4ohms. 

Or your coils are 25mm in diameter, in which case, dafuq.
That can't be right. One of my go to builds was 22g SS, 8 wraps, dual coil. And that was .12.

You put in 28G, not 22G. Which is it?
Well shit. Damned if I know! Whichever is thinnest is the one that's burning.
Not possible!

You either not using 22G, not using SS or have a bed connection.
28g is the thinner one. Look at the bottom right hand corner where it says Heat Flux, 17W, and 200mW/mm^2. That's the watts you wanna be vaping around for that build. Also as you can see this is a .2ohm build, not a .4ohm build.

A 10 wrap dual coil should give you .5ohms, and you could probably use 45-50W if your wicking is very good haha.
Thanks for the reply! I wasn't sure what the heat flux reading meant. Good to know. But I have 5 wraps like the site suggested. I wanted 0.2 but my coil master and mod said upper .3's so I just assumed I miscalculated something somewhere.
If it's supposed to read .2 with dual coils, and it's reading double, one of your coils is probably loose or shorting
