[event] Primarily looking for Poipole codes or any of the following pok√©mon to complete my living dex: Darkrai, Keldeo, Genesect, Diancie, Hoopa, Volcanion.
Are these NA codes?  How many NA Poipole codes are you looking to trade?  I have self-obtained NA Poipole codes.
Yep, NA Codes. I'll do 3 of mine for one of yours if you'd like
I don't mind doing that.  Want to exchange 2 NA Poipole codes for 6 NA L/L codes then?
Sounds good. I'll scratch em off and send em over
All right.  I will do the same.  Do you still need more Poipole codes?  I have a couple extra ones that I can trade for more L/L codes.
I've got 4 left if you want to add 2 more poipole
Sure.  I'll do that. 4 Poipole codes for 10 L/L then?
That sounds good. Pics are good with you?
Yup.  Are you okay with me writing out the codes to send to you?
Yeah, thats fine
Great.  I can reply to your PM whenever you send the link.
