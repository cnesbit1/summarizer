If you truly loved her, you wouldn't have accepted money from her and then broken up because of a few minor inconveniences while she was in school. I'm reading between the lines and guessing that because she respected the rules of her parents while she was going to school and *living in their home*, you weren't getting enough sex or she wasn't able to stay over. But don't feel too bad, now she has her education and she's free to find a partner who isn't a sponge.


Hopefully you have your financial game together now and you won't worry about  your current gf coming after you for money in the future.
How am i a sponge if most of the time she was freely giving me money
When you're taking money from people and you're an adult who can work - then you're a sponge. Grown ups work for what they have - you mention 3 people in your post giving you money - your ex, your mom and your other ex GF. I see a pattern here - the fact that you're even confused about this tells me all I need to know.
A person with self-respect wouldn't have taken it. Why don't you pay her back before you do anything else?
I was in a relationship with her
You don’t borrow money from your significant others ?
borrow implies giving it back

i have friends who pay for my meals and give me things. but then like, i pay for their meal next time, or i do them a favor. or i make the trip to them. 

relationships are give and take. give give give is not a relationship, its a drain.
I was buying her food and things but i wasn’t always able to return it
And sometimes she didn’t want it back
ok. would you ask about her day? offer her a massage? could you not go to see her? were you working/trying to find a job?
Yes i would and i do have a full time job
I could go see her
