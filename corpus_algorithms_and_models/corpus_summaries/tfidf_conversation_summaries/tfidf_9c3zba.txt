So I got the folomov A2 and it’s asking which mA I want to charge at. I have the Sony VTC5As and I should be charging at 1000mA which converts to 1A correct?
If you're not in a hurry and have the option of charging at 0.5A (500mA) it takes longer but is gentler on the battery. Overnight is a good time to do this.
I appreciate it! After this full charge I think that’s what I’ll be doing from now on
You should never leave these batteries on the charger while sleeping.

I was about to watch that I’m just not on that episode yet
I leave mine on the charger for days on end sometimes since it is in another room. A reputable charger should have no issues overcharging or catching fire unless something is seriously technically wrong with it
Yeah, but the first sign something is seriously wrong with it could be when it overcharges or catches fire.  

Likely?  No.  But why take the "it's fine until it's not" approach?  Even reputable companies have issues now and then.  Better to be safe than sorry, especially considering the cost could be your home (or worse) while the only effort needed to prevent that would've been walking into the other room.
True. For me it is in a guest room upstairs so it could burn my house down while I'm home too
If its wrapped well eveything should be fine. I leave lots of things on chargers and ive been doing so for years and nothing happened. People leave their phone charging everynight and nothing happens

If what's wrapped well?  The battery?  The condition of the battery has nothing to do with it if the charger malfunctions.

Unless you're talking about putting the charger in a [battery bag](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_1_11?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=lipo+battery+bag&amp;sprefix=battery+bag%2Caps%2C301&amp;crid=13YYWA9F1Y31M), I agree that would be the smart thing to do.  Although even then, it depends on the quality of the bag.  I've seen Youtube videos where cheap bags did absolutely nothing. 

&gt;I leave lots of things on chargers and ive been doing so for years and nothing happened.

Again, that's the "it's fine until it's not" way of thinking.  Like saying I've never been in a car accident so why bother wearing a seatbelt.  

&gt;People leave their phone charging everynight and nothing happens

Tell that to all the Galaxy Note 7 owners.  And that's just one easily identifiable model.  But with any company that puts out mass quantities of a product, there's going to be a percentage that have defects.  Have you seriously never seen any of the news segments about a charging phone causing a fire?  Heck, we're on /r/electronic_cigarette, there's a post about someone's device catching fire at least once a month.

I understand charging problems are rare, but to say nothing ever happens is ridiculous.

Summary:
I leave lots of things on chargers and ive been doing so for years and nothing happened.
People leave their phone charging everynight and nothing happens.
