Well there you have it.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you all willing to admit the LGBT community have to make some comprimises to be more accepted in society, or are you going to chuck his comments in the " homophobia" bin too?
Let’s see... 

What kind of compromises do you want the LGBT community to have? 
 
PAISEH, Out of topic: Can someone tell me why does my reddit comment automatically get upvoted by myself ah? 😂
For a start...

&amp;#x200B;

No teaching of children about homosexuality

No housing benefits which are specifically for straight couples

Dont start suing businesses who refuse to participate in your gay wedding
Just because he's trying to speak from a neutral standpoint doesnt mean his biases arent stemming from homophobia. Tried his best i think, but its gonna go into the "homophobia" bin i have to throw things there. 

If you need a breakdown on why i think that, do give a holler. Hint: look at his tone, its one of "tolerating something he doesnt like", not hate, just doesnt like.

Also, key to acceptance is through awareness, awareness can only be achieved (at least in this country) via dialogue. Mr goh's aim is to minimise that. So how can this kind of compromise work towards acceptance?
Well said. We should educate kids about homosexuality, but no encouraging of their lifestyle, ie be neutral.
So you don't want the government to treat its people equally? Do you know what the fuck you're even typing?
&gt;Well said. We should educate kids about homosexuality, but no encouraging of their lifestyle, ie be neutral.

No need to educate kids about homosexuality. Period.

Now i am starting to feel the points made in the anti-repeal video isnt just fear mongering.
Teaching chilldren about homosexuality is equality for you?

  
The fuck?
Better get a bigger bin buddy, its overflowing.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not about biases. Its about accepting the reality that there are a vast majority of people who feel perturbed by how the LGBT community have conducted themselves.
How vast are we talking about here? I honestly think a good number of people can't be bothered to form a concrete view of the issue because it doesn't concern them. "Just follow what people say last time lor. They say gay not good means should be correct." Force these peope to sit down and have them put a little thought and reflection into these issues, and add a little empathy into the mix and we should see that this "vast majority" isn't as vast as we assume it to be.
Teaching children that it is ok to identify as gay/lesbian and the society wouldn't treat them unfairly, and their family would accept them for who they are, along with safe sex techniques isn't equality?
Of course not.

Why is teaching kids about your sexuality branded as an equal right? 

&amp;#x200B;

The hell is wrong with society nowadays
&gt;Force these peope to sit down and have them put a little thought and reflection into these issues, and add a little empathy into the mix and we should see that this "vast majority" isn't as vast as we assume it to be.

Sure, while you are it also show them the demands of the LGBT community in the States and Canada. They will definetly remain the majority, even people on the fence will join them.
Only threw his comment there due to the "either or" on your comment and the either is not an option which i have stated why.

Mr goh's comment would go into the ignorant bin though, which i cant blame him because this topic isnt of his interest and clearly singapore hasnt done a good job in getting its people to think about such issues. I mean with so much censorship along the way, how could anyone not in direct contact with the lgbt get a chance to reflect on their views?

And yes it is about biases, ones that stems from ignorance.
What are these demands and how do they affect you?
Share your reasons for each clauses please. 

I'm interested in your train of thoughts.
Why is it then not okay?

Like how we dont need to be educated about people from other race or religion in the past to achieve the current state? You think we can surely get racial harmony without the education/arrangements specifically created to help people get along?

With unrestricted access for religious institution and parents to demonise the lgbt and a censorship towards lgbt content unless they are villians or suffer before dying a horrible death. Its no wonder why we are where we are regarding the lgbt issue.

They need to be educated because the vast majority of adults arent. To get these adults, their parents, to teach them is like asking a primary school kid to teach someone in jc. They are going to screw up.

So if and when singapore reaches the stage where it can grant equality to the lgbt, it will be OUT OF CHARACTER for it to stand at one side and watch the two sides fight it out.
&gt;No teaching of children about homosexuality

I assume you're referring to sex ed classes. In which case, I don't really see any valid reason to not include homosexuality in the curriculum. You do realize that being gay isn't a choice, right?

Still, how does it affect you again? Also, would you support an atheist who wants to keep religion out of the curriculum?

&gt;Dont start suing businesses who refuse to participate in your gay wedding

Do you have similar issues with businesses firing employees because they discriminated against a person's race or religion?

More to the point, do you support a business having the ability to reject service based on someone's religion?
By teaching about the real disadvantages of homosexuality, we can at least discourage them from being homo when they eventually find SJWs online preaching homosexuality
Maybe if children were taught actual facts about homosexuality, like it is not a lifestyle but it is how you are born and not the blatant lies circling around from religious groups etc, just maybe the rampant homophobia here would die down. You can't be taught to be gay, you can't be turned, you are born like that. And if a child or teenager figures out that they are gay, they should know and have been taught that that is okay, just as it is okay to be straight during sexual education. And THAT is equality.
&gt;Like how we dont need to be educated about people from other race or religion in the past to achieve the current state? You think we can surely get racial harmony without the education/arrangements specifically created to help people get along?

&amp;#x200B;

If you are going to liken this with race or religion, you do realise no race or religion has a right to teach their culture/traditions/beliefs in public schools right? Zoroastrians cant demand to be included in the curriculum claiming it is their right.

&amp;#x200B;

If you argue that this is a public good to teach about homosexuality, does everyone feels that it a public good? I certainly dont, especially when taught to young kids. Besides, public policy is primarily guided by majority rule. There will be way more opposition to teaching homosexuality to kids, than teaching about the different races/religions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;With unrestricted access for religious institution and parents to demonise the lgbt and a censorship towards lgbt content unless they are villians or suffer before dying a horrible death. Its no wonder why we are where we are regarding the lgbt issue.

&amp;#x200B;

It does not matter what religious institutions and parents teach their kids. Parents have every damn right to impart whatever moral values they deem fit to their kids. That does not mean you get to introduce homosexuality into children's education to act as a counterweight to those moral values that you dont share. Absurd.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's put it this way, parents may teach polygamy is immoral to their kids. And this may lead to society having a negative image of polygamists. So shall we teach children about polygamists, that there is nothing wrong with it? Same logic with promiscuously and pornography.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Stick to promoting homosexuality to adults. Stop intruding in education and sexualising kids.
&gt;Still, how does it affect you again? 

Because i see it as promotion of homosexual lifestyle and behviour under the guise of equality. There is simply no need to subject children to homosexual education, and the LGBT community's insistence on doing so is what leads people to feel there is some surreptitious agenda about the movement

&gt;Also, would you support an atheist who wants to keep religion out of the curriculum?

Sure. Since you brought this up, do you see religious people demand kids be taught about their religion...on the same level the LGBT community does about homosexuality?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do you have similar issues with businesses firing employees because they discriminated against a person's race or religion? More to the point, do you support a business having the ability to reject service based on someone's religion?

Well i'm generally libertarian on these issues....

&amp;#x200B;

But for arguments sake let's say i do have problems with businesses firing employees on the basis of sexual orientation. I do take issues with a business having the ability to reject service based on someone's religion, even someone's sexual orientation. This still wouldnt be the same as what i said earlier.  

&amp;#x200B;

I was very specific

&gt;Dont start suing businesses who refuse to participate in your gay wedding

This isnt about identity. This is about freedom of association. Can i force a christian book publisher to print and publish my religious book? No. Can i force a wedding photographer who only does indian weddings to take photographs for my amish wedding? No.

&amp;#x200B;

How the hell can you force someone to bake you a cake for your gay wedding?

&amp;#x200B;
Shall we teach about promiscuisity too? How about polygamy?  Or being in an open relationship? 

&amp;#x200B;

That'll show em! And maybe the rampant distaste for sexual liberty here would die down!

&amp;#x200B;

/s
&gt;Because i see it as promotion of homosexual lifestyle and behviour under the guise of equality.

You mean like all the religious holidays we have?

&gt;Sure. Since you brought this up, do you see religious people demand kids be taught about their religion...on the same level the LGBT community does about homosexuality?

Please give one example of the LGBT community in Singapore demanding that children be taught about homosexuality.

The only thing that I've seen people request for is for it to be included in the sex ed curriculum for teens. I don't see an issue with that considering that the whole point of that is to educate our teens on the facts.

&gt;I do take issues with a business having the ability to reject service based on someone's religion, even someone's sexual orientation. This still wouldnt be the same as what i said earlier.

Okay then, what recourse do you propose for someone who's rejected service on the basis on discrimination?

Keep in mind that Singapore doesn't have anti-discrimination laws like the US has, so you don't have to worry about anyone suing a business.

&gt;Can i force a christian book publisher to print and publish my religious book? No. Can i force a wedding photographer who only does indian weddings to take photographs for my amish wedding? No.

Except the bakery didn't advertise itself as a straight wedding only one. If you don't want to serve LGBT couples, why not just advertise it publicly to avoid such issues? 

The reality is that the bakery wants the ability to discriminate against certain customers while avoiding the backlash via people (who are opposed to said discrimination) boycotting it. You can't have you cake and eat it too.

That being said, I don't know how you reconcile being against businesses being discriminatory and rejecting services while also being opposed to forcing a business to serve someone they're discriminating against. Isn't that quite the dichotomy?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Except the bakery didn't advertise itself as a straight wedding only one. If you don't want to serve LGBT couples, why not just advertise it publicly to avoid such issues?

They probably dont want to bake a cake for a neonazi gathering or KKK cross burning either. How is it practical to advertise all the various events the baker will not take part in

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The reality is that the bakery wants the ability to discriminate against certain customers while avoiding the backlash via people (who are opposed to said discrimination) boycotting it. You can't have you cake and eat it too

&amp;#x200B;

Its not discrimination. He should have the liberty to determine in which events he wants to participate in, for which ceremonies he wants to use his artistic skills in.

And he did suffer a backlash, he has gotten death threats. And when the courts forced him to bake cakes for all occassions, he had to drop the service completely and lose 40% of his revenue.

&amp;#x200B;

The gay couple purposefully seeked out a business that would reject baking a cake for their wedding, so they can make a big hoo haa of it. All the baker did was excercise his liberty to not bake a cake, he even claimed they could buy a cake off his shelf.

&amp;#x200B;

Who's the real victim here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tell *"You can't have you cake and eat it too"* to your fellow far-left and LGBT friends. They cannot demand for liberty and rights while simultaneously trying to infringe on other's

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That being said, I don't know how you reconcile being against businesses being discriminatory and rejecting services while also being opposed to forcing a business to serve someone they're discriminating against. Isn't that quite the dichotomy?

&amp;#x200B;

Again, it is not discrimination
Polygamy and open relationships are social constructs, homosexuality is not, a big difference. Comparing apples and oranges.
Did you just assume people aren't born with a high sex drive?????

&amp;#x200B;

TRIGGERED!!!
&gt;Sure, i can see why someone would feel that is a promotion of religion. Your point?

Why is it fine to teach religion to children but not about sexuality (age appropriate, of course)? And Tango Make Three is a very good example of this.

&gt;I assume you're referring to sex ed classes. In which case, I don't really see any valid reason to not include homosexuality in the curriculum. You do realize that being gay isn't a choice, right? - u/ceddya

​You do realize that sex ed is taught at around the age of 15, right? It's certainly not taught to children.

The idea that teens (on the cusp of adulthood) should not be taught actual facts about sexuality just because you disagree with it is ludicrous. For someone who's a libertarian, I have no idea how you can even support active educational censorship.

&gt;They probably dont want to bake a cake for a neonazi gathering or KKK cross burning either. How is it practical to advertise all the various events the baker will not take part in

It's a wedding cake. There are two types of weddings. It's not really hard to be honest about it.

&gt;Its not discrimination. He should have the liberty to determine in which events he wants to participate in, for which ceremonies he wants to use his artistic skills in.

Okay then, I hope you support businesses having the liberty to not serve those who are religious.

&gt;The gay couple purposefully seeked out a business that would reject baking a cake for their wedding, so they can make a big hoo haa of it. All the baker did was excercise his liberty to not bake a cake, he even claimed they could buy a cake off his shelf.

How would they purposefully seek it out if it's not advertised?

'How is it practical to advertise all the various events the baker will not take part in' - /u/MatrixTwo

&gt;Tell "You can't have you cake and eat it too" to your fellow far-left and LGBT friends. They cannot demand for liberty and rights while simultaneously trying to infringe on other's

That's a silly argument, because this business opened in the US that has the Federal Civil Rights Act. If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.

https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/the-right-to-refuse-service-can-a-business-refuse-service-to-someone-because-of-appearance

&gt;Again, it is not discrimination

Again, it actually is discrimination in the US. Please read up on the anti-discrimination laws there along with the court's ruling as to why it construed discrimination.
&gt;Why is it fine to teach religion to children but not about sexuality (age appropriate, of course)?

&amp;#x200B;

Well i wouldnt be mad if religious education got removed (Besides we haven't taught religious education to kids since it was removed some time ago). And i definetly will be wary of those who insist that their religion should be taught to kids.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway teaching religious education is not the same as teaching homosexuality.

We are not telling kids its okay to be of religion X or religion Y, or that such people exist. It has to do with cultural awareness, so that kids who grow up to be adults learn how to conduct themselves among the different religious people, be aware of their sensitives etc.

&amp;#x200B;

There is absolutely no need to introduce homosexuality to kids, why should we confuse kids about their sexuality at such an age? Let them grow and figure it out for themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And Tango Make Three is a very good example of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I would put more responsibility on the parents to ensure they vet through the books before allowing the children to borrow them.

&amp;#x200B;

However, nlb didnt remove it, they moved it to the adult section under the directions of a minister. They are a public library funded by taxpayers. Public policy have to reflect a certain level of majority will. If the majority of people believe in traditional family values and do not think exposure to homosexuality is age-appropriate for children, then thats how public institutions are going to act.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You do realize that sex ed is taught at around the age of 15, right? It's certainly not taught to children.  
&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Hmm isnt there some sex education at primary? Anyway teens around the age of 15 are children too. Their parents still have a right to not expose them to homosexuality education, especially when there is no need to.

&amp;#x200B;

Ehh i said i was a Libertarian on that issue, not in all. Even then a libertarian would rather a parent have some control over their kid’s education than a gov forcing knowledge on their children.

&amp;#x200B;

Funny how your brand it as censorship of facts. There are certain things that are appropriate to teach to children and some are not. We don’t teach about the facts of open relationships, polygamy or masturbation. Is it censorship then?

I can flip it around and see your insistence as a promotion of homosexual culture and lifestyle to kids. A libertarian certainly would want that forced into his kid.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's a wedding cake. There are two types of weddings. It's not really hard to be honest about it.

He makes cakes for various ceremonies and occassions. He had denied other requests before, Halloween, divorce celebrations, bachelor parties etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;How would they purposefully seek it out if it's not advertised?

Because he is known for refusing to participate in events that conflict with his religious views

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That's a silly argument, because this business opened in the US that has the Federal Civil Rights Act. If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.

&amp;#x200B;

You can cite anti-discrimination laws until you are blue in the face, it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t discrimination.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nobody was denied service based on their identity!!!**. The gay couple could have asked for a cake for their birthday, they would have got it. A straight couple could have asked a wedding cake for their friends gay wedding, they would be denied. So how can you pin discrimination on this?

&amp;#x200B;

You know whats funny, there was another case brought in front of the Col Commission, William jack vs azucar bakery. He wanted the bakery to write the quote “Homosexuality is a detestable sin” on a cake, but he was denied. He then sued but lost, the commission found that the bakery did not discriminate

&amp;#x200B;

So refusing to write biblical verses on the cake? Not discrimination. Refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding? Discrimination!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

The fuck?

&amp;#x200B;

Should that  bakery have acceded? Of course not. i support the commissions stance in this instance, the business has a right to refuse to create a specific cake.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Summary:
No need to educate kids about homosexuality.
You can't have you cake and eat it too

&amp;#x200B;

Its not discrimination.
Refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding?
&amp;#x200B;
