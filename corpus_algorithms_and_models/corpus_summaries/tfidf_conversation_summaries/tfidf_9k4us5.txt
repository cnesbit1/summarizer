Broke a 14 fight skid, I told ya'll it was SAPP TIME!
Wait. What? Christ, you're telling me I have to watch that entire video to see how he won? 

I'm going to, but I'm never going to like you again for making me do this.
&gt; to see how he won

He won because the 15 second gas tank that Osunaarash had was blown in the first 15 seconds. Sapp shimmied a couple times and attempted to strike. Sapp also got a fantastic reversal when Osunaarash got a takedown.
These freak show fights are what MMAs all about.
Thanks Boo &lt;3
Plus you have the added benefit of it being 3 3 minute rounds. Had it had an extra six minutes I'm not sure it would've been as amazing as it was.
The sumo was probably like "hehe, this clown will be an easy win".

Sapp was like "IT'S SAPP TIME!"
Bob isn't going to lose to a sumo wrestler, even one that got kicked out of sumo! I was worried at the start that he'd crumble but was overjoyed after that flurry to see Bob still doing his thing, swinging with his eyes closed.
You don't need to open your eyes when you are Bob Sapp.
Eat. Sleep. Break the streak
I'm actually really surprised how glad I am of this result. I totally assumed he'd just tap as usual. I bet someone made *bank* on this fight.. ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€
The japs love Bob if he wins or losses.
is he really fighting though? the guy who beat a kickboxing legend twice is losing to these bums in the stand-up. He's a diver now rather than a fighter

I nearly bet the house againt him, glad I didnâ€™t now
Baruto would fuck Bob Sapp up
Not fair. Baruto is also a national judo champion, he's not a pure sumo.
He fought his ass off in this one.
i think it's also because sapp actually tried instead of throwing the fight for once

Summary:
Baruto would fuck Bob Sapp up.
Sapp was like "IT'S SAPP TIME!"
is he really fighting though?
