Original Response:
**Petitions**
 
[For repeal](https://www.change.org/p/the-singapore-government-repeal-377a)

[Against repeal](https://www.change.org/p/singaporeans-please-keep-penal-code-377a-in-singapore)

Unless there's an actual referendum, these petitions are probably gonna be the best census of which camp is actually larger. Sign away!
"For Repeal"  is going to need some serious traction to close the gap.
The difference shock me
That's because religious leaders are actively sending it to their chat groups and encouraging people to sign. My friends that attend different churches got the message in the span of a few hours, and Im sure the same goes for mosques. The level of coordination is mind boggling. That is what we lack on the pro-lgbt side.
Which is what I find funny - the pro-repeal side is constantly pushing the narrative that they're being attacked, that their rights are being trampled on, etc etc. But yet when such moments exist, none of them can be found, whereas the anti-repeal side is surprisingly efficient at coordinating their "defense" against what they view as an attack on their values.

Is pinkdot really nothing but SJWs blowing hot air? Or are they a genuine minority?
&gt; Or are they a genuine minority?

I'm confused. Are you asking if LGBT folks in Singapore are a genuine minority? Because these petitions clearly show that they are.
Given that now is exams period for JCs and school is reopening next week for secondary and Primary schools the more progressive youths (from what I see) aren't so free to surf the internet. 

Furthermore, the anti-repeal side is backed by powerful religious foreign organisations which the pro repeal side lack. Because of the religious harmony act, some extremists are taking advantage of the situation to abuse it for all its worth. On the other hand organisations that will back the pro-lgbt side are either foreign, which are banned, or the likes of *problematic* people aka Thum, Kristen etc.

Another reason is that the pro-lgbt are mainly young people, students and low level businesspeople. The older anti-repeal group (judging from user profiles) are either retired, have an iron bowl, or hold higher positions in country. They have much more influence than the other side.

Change.org is also open to foreigners. Now when it is daytime in the west users there are signing in the hundreds. No Singaporean (except idiots like me) stays up this late

Finally, we must not rule out the fact that it is possible to create fake accounts on change.org. The only limiting factor is your email, and there are no limitation to number of emails you can have. Furthermore signatures from deleted accounts stay. For all we know a dedicating group is spamming the website, given the extents some people will go.

Ah, here come the good old conspiracy theories and defeatism. It's such a cliche with the LGBTQIA+ community here that it's actually starting to get funny. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't the government come out against religious hardliners as well? Didn't a few hate priests get denied permission to come and speak here? 

I believe the mere fact that Pink Dot exists means that there already is a certain level of organization needed to forward the cause. It's not like pink dot didn't suddenly collapse when foreigners were banned from supporting political causes. 

The issue here is just whether they're willing to use that organization and activism for the other 364 days in the year besides the pink dot rally. And reasonable activism, not "if you don't support gay rights you are a monster and a backwards caveman", which tbf is the same as the "join our religion or go to hell" religious nutjob types.

None of what the guy said is a conspiracy, it's all happening in plain sight.

Yes, but only because the priests insulted **other religions**. If they spoke out against LGBTs they would not have faced any actions.

The groups behind PinkDot are doing that. It's just not as heavily reported on as Pinkdot itself. 

&gt; And reasonable activism, not "if you don't support gay rights you are a monster and a backwards caveman" 

But religious people have a tendency to shift goal posts and redefine what constitutes as 'reasonable' then. When one group is oppressing another, asking for equality or fairness might come off as radical simply because a comprise would still work in the oppressor's favor.

So, students are more free when there's school compared to when there's no school ? lul
Ironically, they're the ones painting LGBT people as having an organized agenda
Actually mosques work quite differently from churches. There are no organised cell groups and such. Most people just go to any mosque every Friday to pray. It isnt fixed nor do you have an affiliation unless you work at the mosque. Volunteering is on a very ad hoc basis as well

Anyway perception in the Muslim community has chaged drastically compared to more than 10 years ago. Sermons on Fridays have been trying to promote inclusivity and tolerance for the LGBT community, basically saying they are people as well and should not discriminate. Treating them as equals as a sermon message is really a big progress from not addressing the issue at all.

Only thing is that mosques in SG try to stay away from politics. MUIS is always very careful in their sermons, and that includes not outrightly criticising policies. Mosques are very aware of the vulnerable position of Muslims in SG so they would rather Muslims not make the news 

The other thing is that most Muslims in SG dont really listen to sermons. You take a look around in a mosque on Friday and you can see most people are distracted or nodding off or just sleeping.

The big issue is that on the ground. The traditional bloc is always more vocal than the progressive one. And fillial piety and respecting elders is a very big thing in the Malay/Muslim community. If you have been taught that heaven lies at the feet of your mother and it comes down to calling her out on her discriminatory views vs keeping mum or just giving a slight nudge. Youre going to bet that most of them wouldnt call these orang lama out. So people who are generally unaffected by the issue or those who do not have strong views ("soft and gentle"). Instead of saying "Sure why not it doesnt affect me anyway" they still will feel uncomfortable voting to repeal because they think everyone around them disagrees and they are afraid of disagreement/disrespekting their elders/their community
&gt;None of what the guy said is a conspiracy, it's all happening in plain sight.

Where's the evidence?

Imagine if the pro-repeal was leading by a large margin, and people were screaming foriegn interference....would you say the same as well?
If the LGBT community doesn’t care enough to rally and organize themselves, they can only blame themselves.
Today is sunday, everyone is rushing to finish their homework lol
That’s a lame reason. The LGBT community should be the ones at the frontline fighting for their own rights, who’s gonna support them if they don’t fight for themselves.

I honestly don’t care either way as it’s not an issue close to my heart. Most ppl I know don’t have feelings either way, especially Buddhist/Taoist/non-religious folks.

The LGBT community needs leaders to stand up and stand out.
We aren't much of a society if we only care about ourselves and not others.  Think about that.
Agree with you, but isnt the LGBT community guilty of that too?
Stepping up when you’re an oppressed part of society sounds way easier than it actually is.

The current attitude of the government towards LGBT can already be taken to be borderline aggressive, cutting Pinkdot’s funding and more. It also doesn’t help that our society is mostly conservative.
So you want your cake delivered on a platter and someone to cut it for you and feed it to you?

Lol. It’s no wonder things aren’t getting any better.
Oppressed? I don’t see anyone bashing up gays and locking them up.

Being oppressed is different from thinking others are oppressing you. The grandson of LKY is openly gay and He doesn’t seem oppressed
They are oppressed in that they are denied the basic right of public housing. In SG, you can't get a flat unless your marriage is legally recognised.


Besides, it sucks for your relationship to technically be illegal.
TIL I’m oppressed because I’m denied public housing because I’m a single male and I earn too much.
Maybe 10% of those so called religous figures are lgbt too.
&gt; earn too much


Well. Congrats i guess.
When has the government funded Pinkdot? Pretty hard to cut funding when you've never funded it in the first place.
I'm under 35 and unmarried. I'm also being denied the basic right of housing. fucking suck it up.
you're not acknowledging his fundamental point.
Well. Congrats on being an angry incel. At least you get access to public housing once you turn 35.


I do feel that it sucks that the government doesn't provide more support to singles (especially single parents) when it comes to housing, but we were discussing about what discrimination gay couples face, not the issue of singles
&gt; unless your marriage is legally recognised

You're the one who's intent on missing the fundamental point - you've done it elsewhere in this thread too. You're not stupid enough to be unable to understand this, so I have to believe you're being purposefully obtuse. You're welcome to stop if you want to try to achieve something.
Hahaha, your mindless parroting of the latest terms from American cultural conflicts  would be funnier if it weren't so sad. 

Grow a brain and think for yourself will you, instead of trying to import every new faddish cultural conflict onto our shores.
As opposed to mindless parroting of government rhetoric and nationalist bullshit

&gt;Grow a brain and think for yourself will you, instead of trying to import every new faddish cultural conflict onto our shores.

lol, pot meet kettle
He's not trying to achieve anything, all he does is take the government's/establishment side on every social and political issue
arent they becoming more arabilized?
\#redpill #feminism
Arabilized? 

The arabisation of Muslims doesn't affect Singapore as much as other countries. Here arabisation usually is limited to traditions, culture and clothings ie wearing burqa when there's no sand here

That being said political views do permeate some of them.

But the arabisation of Malays in Singapore is generally less noticeable than Malays who are apathetic towards religion. They also usually are the middle aged group/older generation rather than the younger generation
That is exactly what I am implying. Coordination cannot come about without good and dedicated leaders.

Summary:
That is what we lack on the pro-lgbt side.
&gt; earn too much


Well.
