Original Response:
I've seen a lot of people on this sub argue that the burden of proof lies with one side or the other but I'm not convinced by that.  The burden of proof lies both with theists AND atheists and doesn't belong solely to one side.  The default starting position is a sort of blank slate where there are no theories or ideas about the origin of the universe.  Then atheists and theists come along and present their various arguments.  Don't just say "I'm right unless you can prove I'm not."  What you should be arguing is "I'm right AND HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD AGREE WITH ME."
