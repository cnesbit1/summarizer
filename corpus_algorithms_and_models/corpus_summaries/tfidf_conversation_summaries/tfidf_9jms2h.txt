Right? I don't get all the 'he was so kind' bullshit. He knew she wanted more, and he made sure he got sex before telling her he didn't. How is that kind?
What? She said after sex when they were cuddling he brought up what everyone told her not to.

&gt;&gt;After we ate dinner, he suggested we go cuddle, which led to sex. After sex when we were cuddling he did what everyone told me not to do: brought up our relationship.
&gt;After sex when we were cuddling **he** did what everyone told me not to do: brought up our relationship.

He brought it up after sex, not her.
He didnâ€™t know I wanted more at all
Maybe, but he didn't just come to this realization after sex while you guys were lying around. He must have considered the idea you were into him with how the date attempts were going. It sounds like he came over with the exact intention to let you down, but waited until after sex.

I was thinking the same thing. Can't believe I had to scroll down this far to see it. And he even started kissing her as he was leaving!?

I'm rolling my eyes so hard at all the people calling this guy "kind-hearted". Barf.

If he truly thought you didn't want more then he wouldn't have even brought it up.
