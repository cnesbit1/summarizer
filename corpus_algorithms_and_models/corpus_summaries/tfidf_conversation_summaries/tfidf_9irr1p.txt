Original Response:
&gt;â€¢ A majority of First Nations residential
school attendees witnessed the abuse
of others or experienced it themselves

.

&gt;The majority of attendees (71.5%) witnessed
the abuse of others. Residential
school attendees reported experiencing the
following types of abuse as a student themselves:
sexual abuse 32.6%, physical abuse
79.2%, and verbal or emotional abuse
79.3%. Other impacts include harsh living
conditions (43.7%), lack of proper clothing
(40.5%), bullying from other children
(61.5%), loss of language (71.1%) and loss
of traditional religion or spirituality
(67.4%).

.

&gt;adults having at least one parent
attending residential school were more likely
to have thought about committing suicide
in their lifetime: 37.2% compared to 25.7%
of those adults who did not have parent(s)
who attended residential school.
Furthermore, 20.4% of adults who had
grandparent(s) who attended residential
schools also had attempted suicide during
their lifetime, in comparison to 13.1% (of
adults who did not have grandparent(s) who
attended residential schools).

That study used a disproportionate number of attendees as compared to the actual population of indigenous people for its results (the chart on page 36 shows this)

There was never any denial of abuse, but as a whole of the indigenous population it would be that less than 5% of the population was abused in the school system

Not to mention that abuse was rampant in non-residential schools run by Catholics

Again, no one denies the negative effects, but it is a matter of realistic scale
The chart shows the generational relatives that went to school. The excerpt on page 35 says more than 5% were affected.

&gt;**Residential School Impacts on Adults**
One in five of First Nations adults (20.3%)
attended residential schools for average of
five years.
Yes, except the statistics don't add up to what is reported in that chart

The numbers in that chart are self-reported, not verified, and likely come from a sample curated to include more residential school attendees than are in the actual population

The 20.3% number is likely from the chosen sample, not from the actual number (the TRC for example says 150,000 students attended over the 120 years, which contradicts this number and puts the percentage closer to 10% of the indigenous population)

The facts matter
You are misreading that chart.  That's attendees with a parent who also attended.
[removed]
Yes, and the numbers don't match the numbers in the TRC report
FFS I can't find the totals in the TRC report, link me a page number por favor.

Ok sweet.  Here the problem with that statement.  Yeah the 150000 attendees, yeah the CURRENT population is population is 1.5m .  But here's the problem, in 96 the population was about 800000, making the 20% claim pretty close to accurate.  Why would you include people who were born after the schools closed in 96 in a study talking about the effects of the schools.  Sorry, it's still crap.
Over 120 years, not just current

So that's 150,000 over 120 years where the average stay was 4.5 years
Yeah that wouldnt really change the numbers very much at all, someone born in 1960 who attended rez school would still count in both totals.  And now youre here stuck arguing 1 tiny little point that isnt even the focus of your article.
I don't think you can take the estimated affected and compare it to the 2018 total population of aboriginal people, the survey was done in 2003. In 2001 the population of adults was about 600,000, giving a number closer to 25% of the adult aboriginal population possibly having been affected at the time of the survey. The factoid also says First Nations which would exclude Metis and Inuit populations. That and accounting for annual death rate of under 10 per 1000 people you're looking at about 150,000 of 1.2 million adults having attended assuming most of the people that died were adults. So the number of attendees is somewhere between 12.5 and 25% of the actual adult population. (these are very very rough numbers from sources that admit to drawing from crude population estimates)

The survey asked those adults if their parents or grandparents had attended. Almost 50% said that at least 1 of their two parents attended.

Summary:
That's attendees with a parent who also attended.
So the number of attendees is somewhere between 12.5 and 25% of the actual adult population.
Yeah the 150000 attendees, yeah the CURRENT population is population is 1.5m .
