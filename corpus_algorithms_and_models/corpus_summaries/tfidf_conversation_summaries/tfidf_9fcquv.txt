Original Response:
Forced Birth, not pro life.
Considering the state of our foster system, I would agree with you.
Optional murder, not pro-choice.

See? Two can play your rhetorical games. And both of us entirely avoid the nuance necessary for a responsible debate on abortion.
Have to have a human for a murder.
If it's murder where are the cops?

This debate is about religious fundamentalism and their argument that a zygote is a human is not supported by the science.  Also, there is no single law in Canada where the government has a say of male anatomy.
All birth is forced from the perspective of the child. A better term is anti-abortion.
Saying "you can't  live in my belly" is murder?  I'm sorry, dude.. but you don't have the right to live in my belly.  I don't know under what messed up belief system you think you have the right to use another person's BODY to support your life, but it's a fucked up one.
It's self defense, not murder.
i never asked to be born! Where are MY rights???
"May the Lord open."
And it's illegal to attempt suicide. Why can't we all just go into the night softly?
Actually it's not illegal to attempt suicide, thank goodness.

Summary:
Saying "you can't  live in my belly" is murder?
Have to have a human for a murder.
