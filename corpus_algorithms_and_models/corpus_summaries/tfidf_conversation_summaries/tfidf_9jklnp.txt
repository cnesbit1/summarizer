Original Response:
Do yall believe he sexually assaulted her or not?
Back then "copping a feel" was not "sexual assault", so no.

Times have changed: just looking at a woman nowadays is "raping with eyes".
Holding someone down, covering their mouth to “cop a feel” was certainly sexual assault in the 80’s. This statement is absurd
He has a point. Todays narrative is to believe that "making a move" on a woman without her permission is assault. What a joke. I've **never** asked a woman before I kissed her for the first time, have you?
"I just kiss, I don't even wait." "Grab them by the pussy"
I’ve never asked a woman before kissing her, have you? It would ruin the moment
Well, context would be you actually asked the woman on a real date and it went well.

And yes, I have asked. It was obvious it was going to happen but I had to make sure. "Can I give you a kiss" didn't seem to ruin the moment at all. All she did was smile and come in for it.
"Can I give you a kiss" is fine but shouldn't be mandatory. That's ludacris. If you lean in to kiss, is that assault? Uh, no. 

Isn't there a new law in Sweden that says you need a womans signature of consent before sex? Europe has gone insane.
Context matters, the situation matters. That's it. Party sex is always dangerous. Getting girls intoxicated to take advantage of especially when you're a privileged guy who apparently loves beer in high school. It's just not a good situation to be in. 

In my context. We went to dinner and ended up at her place watching movies. No sex happened even though I could have tried. I was just trying to be a gentleman. It didn't ever go anywhere but I know for sure it was a good situation. A sober situation.
99% of the time, the man is intoxicated as well. Many of my dates involved alcohol. I've had more than one one-night-stand where she came over to fuck, and we got tipsy first to loosen up. Just because she's intoxicated doesn't mean anything. 

Have you **ever** kissed a woman without asking her permission? What if SHE leans in to kiss you without asking your permission? Is that assault in your book? 

I can't believe I'm even having this conversation
I’m not sure where you learned how to “make a move” but in my experience it has not involved forcefully holding a person down and quieting their screams by holding my hand over their mouth and having a friend turn up music.
Let's make one thing perfectly clear. You don't know if any of that is true, no more than I do. So lets cut the shit.
Yeah but she is coming over for an intimate thing. 

Its context. Context matters, situation matters. Also the guy being drunk too argument is a degenerate position to hold.
I don’t know and we likely never will. I do know what I saw yesterday. I believed her, I did not believe him.  I know she welcomes an FBI investigation, the GOP does not.
So by your own standards, you sexually assaulted a woman?

&gt; the guy being drunk too argument is a degenerate position 

wtf explain this. Does he think clearly in your eyes? What's to keep her from taking advantage of him if they're both drinking
I do know what I saw yesterday. I believed him, I did not believe her.
No need to get unhinged. By your standards getting drunk at a party excuses your sexual behavior.

Then trying to flip it as a female predator thing. 

Quite honestly you make arguments only a degenerate would make.
Way to avoid my questions.
"What happens if she rapes him"

You have made some of the most grotesque defense of sexual assault after I confronted you with Trumps own words describing how he sexually assaults women. 

That is the truth. To hell with your questions, you do nothing more than make degenerate arguments to excuse sexual misconduct. 

You can't even believe someone would ask permission to kiss someone. Which is awfully telling.
You're going in circles. Let's try this again

So by your own standards, you sexually assaulted a woman?

&gt; the guy being drunk too argument is a degenerate position 

~~wtf~~ explain this. Does he think clearly in your eyes? What's to keep her from taking advantage of him if they're both drinking
This is why you are unhinged. You are accusing me of sexual assault now when I said nothing of the sort. 

And you're doing this to defend the president. 

So because he's drunk and not thinking clearly the man is allowed to rape and apparently can't fight off a woman. 

Degenerate.
Which is fair. People have different perceptions. Although to argue as you did earlier that the events that she described  were not assault is an absolute absurdity.
more filibustering. We're done here
Yes we are. 

When you have to accuse someone of sexual assault to defend the president and his words. You've lost your morality and there is absolutely no point in ever believing a word typed from your account.

Guaranteed we'll find you in a thread where a Democrat is accused. And suddenly we will both think sexual assault is bad. 

Good luck in whatever it is you do. I'm sure I'll run into your degenerate arguments again sometime.

Summary:
I believed her, I did not believe him.
I believed him, I did not believe her.
So by your own standards, you sexually assaulted a woman?
Let's try this again

So by your own standards, you sexually assaulted a woman?
And yes, I have asked.
I've **never** asked a woman before I kissed her for the first time, have you?
I’ve never asked a woman before kissing her, have you?
It's just not a good situation to be in.
Have you **ever** kissed a woman without asking her permission?
