Hey I’m living there! What street is that?
It's Carlyle Street just off from the Dominos at the Gasworks
That’s super close to where I’m at.

Infront of the dodgiest house in town. https://m.dailymercury.com.au/news/man-shot-in-the-groin-recovering-but-uncooperative/3446331/

As soon as I saw the street I knew Op was taking this photo from a room in Oaks on Carlyle 👌🏻 I stay there every time I go back to visit family
View from the Oaks apartments, not sure which street it is
No shit. I can see that building from my house. Hah.
That's it, taken from my room at the Oaks on Carlyle
