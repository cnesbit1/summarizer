Original Response:
Politics is the very last thing I want to think about when I am buying shoes.  And if I *am* forced to think about politics in the shoe store, I am going to think of all those Asian child factory slaves who are forced to manufacture the shoes.
I think you may want to revisit the definition of slave
You work for Nike?
You will find their child labor and other social compliance policies on their website.  They are one of the leaders in social responsibility, mostly because they had problems early on and recognized that there brand required protection.
Then in that case, think about all the tens of thousands of child workers making well below minimum wage, whose basic human rights are being violated and/or denied, routinely, by Nike.
buy your shoes on ebay then. quit being so sensitive to everything around you. its just an ad.
&gt;  think about all the tens of thousands of child workers making well below minimum wage

"Wages were also below the legal minimum at up to 25% of factories"

fair point, 1/4 of the workers is a good chunk. a fairly inexcusable chunk. didnt have that info from that article.
Nevermind wages. Forced to work upwards of 60 hours a week. Punished if they didn’t. Restricted access to toilets and water during work hours. Rarely allowed even a single day off in a 7 day work week. Takes “just do it” to a whole different meaning.

Summary:
