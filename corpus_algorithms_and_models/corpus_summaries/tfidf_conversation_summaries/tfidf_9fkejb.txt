the focus point of the article is that the "BUY BITCOIN" page lists BCH with a "recommended" mark on it over BTC.

How do you expect the adoption will play out if, during the next bull run, every other housewife will go to "bitcoin dot com" and purchase a heap of useless shitcoins from mr Mad over there?

What was the exact reason Google Play banned the wallet app for a day?
Technically we doing it to a company. Bitcoin.com should not even list  Btc as Bitcoin core. I don't care if they add other coins. BCH- I know some good people very very few but they know BTC is Bitcoin but think BCH is better. Bitcoin.com is very misleading calling BTC-Bitcoin core.
It has happened often already.

You're so ignorant you should move over to Bcash. Nobody will miss you!
