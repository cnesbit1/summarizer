Original Response:
I recently submitted this to r/relationships but figured y’all would maybe understand the nuances of this situation better. 


My boyfriend and I have been together for five months. Our relationship is great and we truly deeply care about eachother. 

There is one problem though: he has a secret kink which he has kept me in the dark about and I’m really nervous he’s hiding it from me because he’s afraid it will scare me off. 

I know this because a month into our relationship he asked me my kinks after I answered I asked him the same. He said ‘not really’ and I joked that I would ‘figure them out right now’ I kept prodding and things suddenly got very serious. He told me he does have something he’s into but he hasn’t really told too many people about it and that it makes him uncomfortable to talk about so soon. I immediately felt bad and told him that he could take his time and tell me when he was ready. 

I know this subject is sensitive but it’s been around four months since we had that conversation. I kind of forgot about it since then but recently started thinking about it because he has started joking around asking “if I was into (insert random kink) here would you do that with me?”, these jokes have become frequent and I think it might be his way of feeling out whether he’s ready to tell me.

I’m getting impatient, I know it’s not really fair of me to pry or make him tell me when he’s not ready but what if it’s a serious kink, something that’s scary for me, or something that I hear about and can never look at him the same way again. 

I guess my question is, is it fair for me to bring it up again? I want to approach this in a way that is appropriate. I just need to know because it’s killing me not to.
Woof he’s teasing this thing out like the big reveal in a TV series that needs a good twist, and now you are too. 

Yeah it’s totally okay to ask him as long as you update everyone here. 

My money is on furry shit, diapers, or having a juggalo fetish. 

(Edit: seriously he wouldn’t bring it up if he didn’t want to admit somehow. Be open as hell and let him know je won’t be judged).
Lmaooo those three options are pretty interesting 🤔🤔
For the record THAT part was a joke. Tho who knows maybe it IS one of those. Personally I think I’d take the juggalo fetish given the options. (Assuming we are talking full furry and not just some light neko girl stuff).
Haha I gotchu. Kind of private but have you had a similar situation with a partner? Is it bad to try something you might not be interested for the sake of making your partner happy? 

Tbh I lost my virginity to this guy lol and for a while even being on top made me uncomfortable and ofcourse im into it now among some actual kinky stuff. So I guess what I’m saying is, is it possible to think you’re not into something, try it for your partners sake, and then actually be into it?

&gt; Being a decent human being, this was closer to furrydom than I wanted

Really?

&gt;r/sex is for civil discussions about all facets of sexuality and sexual relationships. It is a sex-positive community and a safe space for people of all genders and orientations.

Kink shaming is categorically forbidden here.  Feel free to say "I wasn't comfortable with this kink", that's cool.  Suggesting that you ween't comfortable with it because you were a decent human being is extremely insulting and flies in the face of why this community exists.
I thought this was clear sarcasm and an admission that i had already happily engaged in something furry adjacent. I apologize to any furries that read this and were offended. Genuinely. Yiff in peace.

Yes, it's possible. It happens to all of us with respect to something, whether it's food, television, sports or sex—or whatever else. Sometimes we think we don't like something, but we're wrong. They key isn't to avoid doing things you're not interested in. They key is to not do things you're uncomfortable with. If you're not interested in something, but you're not uncomfortable with it either, feel free to try it with your partner.
Sarcasm is notoriously hard to detect on the internet. Best be safe and always tag it with /s
Thought I’d update you since you asked! 

So I was literally stressed for no reason at. All. 
I texted him I wanted to talk about something personal and sexual and he figured it out right away. The actually convo went really well too he was just pretty embarrassed about it. I assured him he didn’t have to tell me if he wasn’t ready.

After like 15 min he finally admitted to it. Out of principle and because he really really wants no one to know I won’t tell you anything specific but it’s literally the most random thing, like super benign and not scary at all. Just really really random kind of akin to bens obsession with girls in roller skates on parks and rec haha. 

Anyways I’m glad I asked and he said he was probs going to tell me soon anyway since he was worried I was going to think it was something serious that requires a lot of discussion and thought like CNC. 

So yah, worked out really well and our relationship is stronger than ever. Thanks for the advice!!

So I guess what I’m saying is, is it possible to think you’re not into something, try it for your partners sake, and then actually be into it?
