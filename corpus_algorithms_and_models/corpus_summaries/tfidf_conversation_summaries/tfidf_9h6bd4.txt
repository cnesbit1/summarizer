Brett Kavanaugh's college frat, direct from 1985, when he was in it:

"Boys will be boys," huh?

Kavanaugh is currently accused of holding a woman down and sexually assaulting her just two years before this photo was taken and letter to the editor written.

Frats were uncommon at Yale at this time and this particular fraternity was known for having poor attitudes towards women.

*This* is the frat he *chose* to join after seeing them in action and hearing about them his freshman year, despite Yale having a robust, enjoyable residential college system and only 2 real frats and no sororities at the time.

This frat had a history prior to, and after this, as drunk misogynistic assholes. And Kavanaugh, who was bright enough to get into Yale and who had a majority of acquaintances freshman year who were *not* joining this frat, thought they were a great bunch of guys that he'd like to swear brotherhood to.

Before and after Kavanaugh:

   [The frat was suspended for 5 years in 2011:](https://www.weeklystandard.com/charlotte-allen/of-frats-and-men)

&gt;During the fall of 2010 Deke pledges at Yale enraged campus feminists when they were obliged, as part of hazing, to march past a dorm that housed freshman women, chanting **“No means yes, and yes means anal!”** It is unlikely that the chant actually caused any of the women to fear harm​—​and Yale also has a longstanding guarantee of free expression for its students​—​but Yale College’s then-dean, Mary Miller, first called for permanent banishment of the Dekes, then, in 2011, settled on a five-year suspension. A feminist magazine had described the 18-year-old pledges as “a moving gang of men, chanting in deep, throaty voices for sexual assault.”

2   [In 1973, a Yale DKE president said:](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/18/archives/another-fraternity-is-closed-at-yale-how-2-groups-survived-dont.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimesmachine.nytimes.com%2Ftimesmachine%2F1973%2F09%2F18%2F90970150.html%3Faction%3Dclick&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;module=LedeAsset&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentCollection=Archives)

&gt;“A few years ago the word fraternity had a bad name and we were trying to play down the image of the drunken jock and build the fraternity into a gentlemen's club. I thought we had im proved our membership and could improve it again this year with another year of grace. But the trustees put their foot down and said that's it. We just couldn't make it any more.”

3   [In 1967 George W. Bush defended the hazing tradition of branding new members](https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2006/01/20/an-inside-look-at-dkes-hell-week/):

&gt;In 1967, a Yale Daily News article exposed hazing traditions that make the stories of contemporary initiation rites seem like a mere weeklong frat party. “Pledge week at DKE this fall began with a food fight,” the article stated, “and ended with a hot branding iron applied to the small of each pledge’s back.” The article, stating that beatings and hot coat hangers bent in a “D” shape were routine parts of DKE initiation, led to a story in The New York Times a week later, in which President George W. Bush ’68, a former DKE president, defended his fraternity’s practices. DKE was later fined for its inappropriate initiation rites, but these days DKE members said the fraternity no longer brands its pledges.

5   [The 2016-17 president of Yale DKE was suspended for "penetration without consent."](https://www.businessinsider.com/yale-delta-kappa-epsilon-2018-1)

&gt;Two women on Yale's campus told Business Insider they were the victims of sexual assaults by brothers in Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE, pronounced "Deke") during the 2016-17 school year. The university is aware of one of these instances. It issued a three-term suspension of the 2016-17 DKE President after it made the determination that he had engaged in "penetration without consent." Yale's sexual-misconduct committee uses a lower standard of proof than the standard applied to criminal proceedings. More than a dozen other women told Business Insider they've witnessed or experienced separate instances of nonconsensual sexual contact by DKE brothers since 2014, including unwanted kissing, groping, and sexual assault.

The fact that he joined this fraternity reflects on his judgment and values.

When he's being vetted to be a Supreme Court Justice for the rest of his life, that's incredibly relevant. To deny it is, is a reflection on *your* judgment.

Guy goes to a southern college. He visits frats. 

One's quiet and seems studious. Members are often top of their class.

One's party central. Smells. Lots of guys taking classes pass/fail, some guys dropping classes before they fail them, some on academic probation and a member who's currently out on suspension for student code violations.

One has just average guys. Or so it seems. Until you get down in the "hidden" basement where they have the Confederate flag hanging. Lots of racists jokes. Subtle and gradually bolder white supremacist talk as they get into their beer.

Pick one. Does your choice reflect on you? That's not McCarthyism.
lol'd at secret basement. 

you've seen too many movies. frat guys just throw keggers and play beer pong. there aren't any nefarious underground meetings where they discuss ways to propagate the patriarchy or further white supremacy
Nice trying to dodge the main point: 

The fraternity you choose is *absolutely* a reflection of your personal character.
[removed]
Choosing a quiet studious fraternity would not reflect negatively on your character. Obviously. Seriously obviously.

Summary:
The fact that he joined this fraternity reflects on his judgment and values.
