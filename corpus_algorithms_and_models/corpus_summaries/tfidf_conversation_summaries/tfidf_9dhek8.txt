Original Response:
Entire island has no power and water and petrol sales are stopped. Every building is dark and no traffic lights or street lights are working. I'm overnighting at a 7-11 here in Obihiro near Hakurindai station. Hope they manage to get things restored soon, but it may be a few days or even over a week, who knows...
Currently trapped in Niseko. Stockpiled some food and water as well. Hope the power comes back soon :( 

Skies are clear and the night sky view is breathtaking at least...
somehow if i am stuck somewhere, Niseko would be amongst my top choices
Touché. Also there’re less people in summer right now so it’s not as chaotic, fortunately
Are they selling petrol.in your area? Only 2 stations in my area are and the lines are massive. So I can't go anywhere yet.

Niseko is probably nicer than the somewhat rundown town I'm in...
According to google maps the the nearest few are probably at Kutchan station, a 12min drive or 7km walk away. I don’t have a car so I’m not sure about their condition or if they’re even operating... good luck man

Update: passed by Kutchan, the petrol station has a queue of about 4 cars only. Seems to be operating fine.
Check the Owashi lodge Facebook. They’ve set out free food and water.
Just left Niseko area, but thanks for the tip :)
i loved Niseko. never been in summer.
Niseko's great - more Aussie than Japanese!
Is it insensitive to ask if you got any good pictures to show for it?

Here you go. Sorry about the watermarks, don't wanna get the (just the Milky Way one tbh) photos stolen.
