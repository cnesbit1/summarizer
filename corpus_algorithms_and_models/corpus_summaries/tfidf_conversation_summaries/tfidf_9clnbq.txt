You can't make this shit up.

Well, actually I guess you can, because they did.

There it is. An astronut saves the day -- again -- by plugging a hole in the space station with his thumb.

Amazing how no one has died up there in nearly 20 years.  Good thing the "vacuum of space" didn't destroy them after a hole appeared in their space station traveling at about 17,000 mph.

I'm surprised they don't put more holes in the thing, floating around in gorilla suits, playing rousing flute and guitar solos, etc. I mean, even OK Go didn't take their musical instruments into ["space."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWGJA9i18Co)

Some will notice that this ridiculous story seems to be based on the "little hero of Holland" tale, where a Dutch boy plugs a leaky dike with his finger until help arrives, popularized in the 1865 book [*Hans Brinker.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates)

**But here's the thing.** Look at the photo Chris Hadfield posted of the hole that was repaired. See how it is marked with official NASA labels, like all their official photos?

Well, it's the same picture as the album cover of this 2014 contemporary Christian album:

Let there be no mistake: it's the exact same photo. Chris Hadfield posted a photo labeled as an official NASA photo which is from a Christian rock CD cover from 2014. (Released, by the way, on the occultish date of 9/23.)

I look forward to seeing the excuses put forth by the eternally faithful to the government organization called NASA.

For the unbiased observer, take note: this is why we distrust NASA and doubt the things they say they do and the places they say they go....  it's because they *unendingly give us pure bullshit, all the time, and constantly lie to us and mock us.* 

Anyway, see you guys later, I'll be spending my morning reading Remedy Drive lyrics.
Similar back in the Apollo days when NASA literally made the claim that they repaired the LEM with duck tape.
And the claim that the walls of said LEM were no thicker than two sheets of aluminum foil. I guess space debris wasnâ€™t a problem back then.
There's a difference between a lander designed to work in space for a few days, and a space station designed to operate for decades.
No-one in their right mind claimed that...
&gt; And the claim that the walls of said LEM were no thicker than two sheets of aluminum foil

People think you are lying, but there are at least a couple Apollo "astronaughs" who made the claim the LEM was no thicker than a few layers of Reynolds aluminum foil
No one in their right mind would, like you say, it was at least two Apollo era astronauts that claimed Apollo LEM was no thicker than a few layers of Reynolds aluminum foil.

It doesn't surprise me you don't know that, because the people that believe this utter horse shit are not actually fully aware of the truly idiotic and stupid historical claims that have been made in the past.
Well, as I have explained to you before, it was built the same way as an aircraft, with a pressurised aluminium alloy cabin,covered in 20+ layers of various materials. But hey, that's OK, you keep on pulling 'facts' out your arse.
&gt; it was at least two Apollo era astronauts that claimed Apollo LEM was no thicker than a few layers of Reynolds aluminum foil.
