Original Response:
Looks like a couple people are interested in getting some Poipole codes so hit me with them offers and I'll be going to grab them tomorrow! As for RNG services, I want some perfect mons that'll hatch shiny :) I'll make a list of a couple wants tonight if someone is able to do it.
I can do the egg RNG (Using NTR) Feel free to post your list
Sorry it‚Äôs been a while since I got into this so is NTR able to RNG 7th gen eggs?
Yes, it's possible to RNG gen 7 eggs
&gt;(TSV: 3418) two of the ones I need are Jolly Bagon 31/31/31/x/31/31 EM= Dragon Dance  
Modest Shellos 31/x/31/31/31/31  
&gt;  
&gt;Also need an adamant recycle munchlax but I read you can get only get recycle on ORAS right? Gotta hold out on that one since I don't have my TSV for Alpha Sapphire unless theres a different way?

&amp;#x200B;
I can do the first two. I'm looking for 1 code each.


IIRC Munchlax can learn Recycle from the move relearner, but I would ask 2 codes  (unless IVs don't matter) because the Incense makes it harder to RNG
So 4 codes for the 3? I‚Äôd be down for that
Alright. I'll get started then.
Your eggs are ready. Let me know when you're ready to trade (Tomorrow obviously)
Awesome! I should be ready to trade by 4 pm MST tomorrow
Ready when you are!
Good timing, I'll head on now.
Thanks a lot man! üôèüèæ
No problem. trade completed.

BTW would you mind telling me how many you were able to get? I need a bunch more (10+) and I'd be willing to trade for as many as you can get.
I have 10 more actually. Could possibly get more. Are you able to RNG comp shiny legends on gen 7 by chance? ü§î still a newb to this new gen so not sure if that‚Äôs a dumb question or it‚Äôs hard as hell haha
It's possible to do but it's pretty frustrating and can take a long time. Gen 6 (ORAS) is easier if you're interested in Legendary Pokemon transferred up

Edit: Sorry, I just checked all my saves and I'd have to do new playthroughs so it's not something I can do right now.
Hmm I do need a therian forme landorus... would he be possible to do?
Actually, let me check, I think I might have Landorus available to catch in Gen 6. I can do Shiny/Nature/HP, so go ahead and think of the stats if you're interested

Yep, he's still there
How many would you want for a 
Shiny, Modest, intimidate with HP Ice (I think 31/30/30/31/31/31 is best right?)
Honestly a perfect IV spread isn't realistic, I've gone hundreds of attempts without seeing one. I'll get you the best spread available within a few hours


For a Shiny/Modest/HP Ice I would ask 4 codes.
Hey can you also get me:
Careful Litten with Intimidate 31/31/31/x/31/31 EM: Fake Out
Timid Gengar with Cursed Body 31/x/31/31/31/31 EM: Perish Song
Alright, I'll have them done tomorrow
Your eggs are ready. Let me know when you're available
Lmao I just realized I wrote Gengar instead of Gastly ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but anyway, I‚Äôll be on in 10!
Heading online now
Trade completed.

Summary:
I have 10 more actually.
Yes, it's possible to RNG gen 7 eggs.
Let me know when you're available.
I should be ready to trade by 4 pm MST tomorrow.
