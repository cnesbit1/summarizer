This is why aliens don't talk to us
Weirdest part was explaining this to my mom when she asked why I'm laughing
Wtf dude why u remove it I dont see it anymore
It's definitely this or the fact that Japanese porn has them afraid of what we'll do with their tentacles.
I don’t think he removed it. If you look at his profile it was also posted on a military sub. So either he forgot that one or he didn’t remove the one on here himself.
He didn't remove by choice, apparently anything dealing with pissing/shitting is removed by mod team under "rule 2c Common fuckups".

Which is pretty lame as some of the most funniest tifu have been about those things.
I'm not sure spraying yourself with your fecal matter is a common fuck up for an adult. I enjoyed that story a lot as well.
Why did your post her removed from tofu?

Wonder if there are some of their population who are pissed their government doesn't allow them to make contact with us, cause you know, they'd be into it.
