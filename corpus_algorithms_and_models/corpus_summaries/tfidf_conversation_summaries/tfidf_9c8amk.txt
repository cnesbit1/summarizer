I went to visit a few days ago and Ioved it. I can’t find any negatives other than how small the place is. I’m also just a visitor so the perspective is entirely different from someone who lives there.
Fucking. Hot. Weather.

Or maybe do what Dubai does: air con bus stops?
Wth they have air conditioning on bus stops
And let Malaysia pay for it

Currently under trial, checkout the bus stop Infront of plaza sing
