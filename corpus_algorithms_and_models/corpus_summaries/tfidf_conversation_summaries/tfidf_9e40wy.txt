How you going to celebrate mother mary’s birthday??
Mary ain't my mother, pal.
I ain't your pal, buddy
Jesus wasn't just speaking to John when he said, "Behold, your mother!"
Yeah he was.
Rev 12 says different
How so?
Defensive much? Nobody said she was.
I ain't your buddy, friend.
Not Mary.  Just like it’s not her birthday.  Just like we shouldn’t pray to or worship her.
&gt; worship her

Nobody worships her
Jesus isn't your brother?

Summary:
Mary ain't my mother, pal.
