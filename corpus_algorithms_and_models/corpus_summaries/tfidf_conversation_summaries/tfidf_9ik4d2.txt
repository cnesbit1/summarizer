Original Response:
I wasn't sure where else to post about this situation. I occasionally browse through this sub and see other men post and I think the subject matter is relevant enough. Honestly, I just want to vent about it. It's a very recent event and one that was pretty traumatic. For me at least... so here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd been dating a girl, we'll call her Cheyenne, for 4 years (together since we were seniors in high school). Lived together for 2. We've had problems like every couple, but we've always worked through them. Cheyenne has some mental issues that she has dealt with since she was young. Anxiety, depression, and anger management problems. The latter issue was very straining on us. Whenever we got in fights, she would resort to screaming, verbal abuse, and, occasionally, physical violence. I've been punched, shoved, and had things thrown at me on multiple occasions. I'd never spoken up about it before due to embarrassment. Despite everything, we still loved each other. She went to therapy and went on meds to help reconcile the issues we had. Things were good for time.

&amp;#x200B;

This past May, Cheyenne got extremely sick and got diagnosed with Celiacs disease. She was in and out of hospitals for weeks. I was there with her the whole time caring and supporting her. She stopped taking her meds due to being so sick and never got back on them. Problems arose once more. After she got better, we moved into a house with my brother (renting). Things escalated rather quickly between Cheyenne and I. Constant fighting and overall tension in the house. Eventually, we decided to take a "break", focus on ourselves, but continue working on us.

&amp;#x200B;

She planned a weekend with her cousin to go to Chicago. Didn't think much of it for she visits Chicago with her family every year. The Sunday she came home, she told me she had actually stayed in New York and stayed with a guy she was with before we got together. At that point, I felt extremely betrayed and ended things with her. We lived together, cordially, for a few months, but things gradually became worse and worse. I wont get into details, but things came to head this past weekend. She finally moved out (quit her job to move in with the guy she cheated on me with in NY, while also attempting to break our lease). We had been arguing about what was hers and what was mine in the house as she was moving out. Things escalated so badly that she attempted to steal my laptop for school and a few of my guitars. She was stomping around the house, swearing and screaming, all while her family, my brother, and myself were in the house. She was erratic. Her dad finally intervened and told her to stop what she was doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheyenne finally snapped and punched me, as hard as she could, in the neck, in front of everybody.

&amp;#x200B;

I was utterly shocked and heartbroken. My brother screamed and got in between us. Her parents scrambled, extremely disappointed, trying to deescalate the situation. My brother threatened  to call the police. He was screaming, I was screaming, her parents were screaming. It was total pandemonium. They were begging us not to call the police. Her dad even resorted to saying something along the lines of, "you're really going to call the cops because a girl hit you?". It was extremely painful hearing him say that. Someone I considered a father-in-law. I told my brother to just forget it. We talked and everything calmed down slightly. They left and everything was quiet.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother and I talked about it for a bit. After a lot of careful consideration, or at least I hope, I went to the police station and reported her. It was very hard and extremely embarrassing... The officer I reported the incident to looked at me as if I was joking. He was completely shocked that I came to the police about this. He asked me if I was just trying to get revenge and if I wasn't going to ever see her again, why did I even bother reporting this? I was in complete shock. I told him I was just trying to do the right thing. He said something along the lines of, "well now this poor girl won't be able to get a job. Congratulations". I started crying and made a fool of myself right there in the station. He wrote up the report, told me an investigator would get in contact with me, and I left completely shaken, heartbroken, and regretful.

&amp;#x200B;

Did I do the right thing? Was I wrong about everything? Should I have just let this go? Is sexism to blame for the regret I'm feeling?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading if you did.

EDIT:

Wow. I just got home from work and never expected this many responses if any. Thank you all so much for your kind words and affirmation. I'm almost overwhelmed with how much feedback I've been given. And thank you for those you gave me the more "unpopular" opinions. It honestly gives me some good perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be doing you all a disservice if I didn't clear up some details about this whole situation and I hope this doesn't indicate that I'm justifying Cheyenne's actions. Here goes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am by NO MEANS a perfect person nor was I perfect boyfriend. I had done my fair share of hurtful things towards Cheyenne, as many couples do whether they intended to do so or not. Now, I have NEVER physically hurt her nor have I verbally degraded her character or feelings. I, however, am guilty of neglect.

&amp;#x200B;

A little over a year ago, I got admitted into a very prestigious school. I worked really hard to get into a program at this particular school and have worked my ass off since I started. Inevitably, most of my time and effort became devoted to my work. It was and still is my passion and something I'm proud of pursuing. However, I became blinded by ambition to pursue a career in something I care about to a fault. I couldn't and wouldn't give Cheyenne the attention and care she needed. Do I think she expected too much sometimes? Maybe. But I think at that point I should've ended things before things could get the way they are now, but I was insecure, selfish, and I couldn't imagine my life without her.

&amp;#x200B;

To many people in our lives (our families and friends. Even strangers and acquaintances) we were the "all American couple". We're both young, attractive, young adults with dreams and aspirations who supported each other. Or so we thought. Behind all the romanticism that people conjured up about us, was a seriously dysfunctional relationship and one I hope I can learn from. I'm not exactly sure why I'm saying any of this, but it's there for you to decipher I guess. Let me know what you come up with because I sure as hell don't know what this means.

&amp;#x200B;

I actually received a call from an investigator while I was at work, so I'll be calling her back tomorrow after class. I'll try to keep you updated as best I can, but I have a lot of work to do in preparation for my Co-op. Thanks again to everyone who spared time to read my post. Means a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers.

One punch. A single punch from someone with mental problems off their medication and you gave her a criminal record for it. Unbelievable.
She made the decision to act like a criminal, so she can get treated like a criminal. We don't know the finality of the case and how it will even end for her. But she made the choice, she can live the consequences. Life is about the choices you make. Whether you really didn't mean them, or this or that, whatever, she chose to punch the OP at the end of the day, and deserves what's coming to her for it.
Did you read the story? He said she's been physically and mentally abusive before. He said he'd been trying his best to support her. A mental illness is not an excuse to assult someone. Nor is it a reason not to report someone. If she's done this before then she'll do it again, and it very well might escalate.
If the roles were reversed (a man hitting a woman) no-one would be defending him, he has been shoved verbally assaulted and physically assaulted ‘occasionally’ as he said ... no-one deserves that he done the right thing reporting her she is a danger and needs to be treated as such a ‘criminal’ mental issues is not an excuse as many of us have them and we don’t retaliate by abusing someone else
Most mental illnesses don't make you more inclined to such behavior. Hers does.
Of course it's a mitigating factor. A punch isn't worth ruining someone anyway
So what if it's a crime? I don't care what's lawful i care what's moral. Destroying someone over a punch is disproportionate.
It’s still domestic abuse ... mental issues or not ... he had stood by her through many issues and the continued abuse can not be justified
Did you read my comment?

He's experianced YEARS of physical and mental abuse, not returning it. She has a therapist and medication. She has support, and still she's abusive.

She's abusive and dangerous. This man needs evidence in place to protect himself. You agree, no?
It wasn't going to continue. She was leaving anyway. All she needed was to get back on her meds. Now she's ruined. Yes it qualifies as domestic abuse but I don't care what's lawful i care what's moral. Destroying someone for a punch is not right.
Choosing to punch someone isn't moral either. I highly doubt she get's "destroyed" but she absolutely deserves to be punished. Sure, she only punched him this time, what happens the next time she has an episode like that?
[removed]
But isn’t it the moral thing to report it so that he new boyfriend or any future bf’s know about her violent tendencies
Someone should have got her back on meds so there wouldn't be a next time.
No.
Herself. You know, the adult who’s responsible for her.
She isn't of sound mind and therefore has limited culpability and needs support.
She chose not to take her meds, something she needs to do. She made the choice not to, she suffers the consequences of her actions not to.
People still have problems on meds. They're not magic.
No, but being on meds don’t give you an excuse to be shitty. Hopefully this situation helps her  either be put in greater care, or learn that lesson.
Yeh criminal records tend to be really helpful.
It’ll potentially deter her from doing it again. Or, if it truly was her state of mind and she really needs more meds/supervision, she will now get them. Win win.
Yeah that's probably true, since entering the criminal justice system tends to be helpful to people.
It certainly can be. You’re excusing her behavior, when this will only be good for her. It’s a tough learning experience, but in a society where people aren’t held accountable for their actions, now is a good time to start
Sheer nonsense. It almost always isn't. You can piss off now.
So you’re just gonna let her off the hook despite making a decision to do what she did? Nice logic and argument
For the hundredth time, she has reduced culpability because of her illness. Besides, it was a decision to throw one punch. So what! Yes i say let her off the hook.
You don’t even know what her illness is. If she truly is ill then turning her in will help her. If she wasn’t, she learns a lesson. Life sucks sometimes, doesn’t mean you can go around hitting people and blame it on meds. It was her decision. She deserves what happens to her.
&gt; You don’t even know what her illness is.

According to OP, one that makes her violent if not properly medicated.

&gt; If she truly is ill then turning her in will help her.

What? Entering the criminal justice system is especially terrible for the mentally ill. You're so full of shit and you know it.

 &gt; Life sucks sometimes, doesn’t mean you can go around hitting people and blame it on meds. 

I blamed it on her illness, so did OP in part. No one blamed meds. Stop being stupid, itll ruin your life.


&gt; She deserves what happens to her.

No one deserves a criminal record for throwing a punch. Aaaaaand now you're blocked for boring me with repeated stupidity.
Lol I’m glad you blocked me, your ignorance doesn’t need to continue. Yes, assaulting someone deserves a criminal record. There’s no way to twist it. 

That’s what the OP says. We don’t know if she’s actually diagnosed with something or what. 

The criminal justice system isn’t all bad. They will find help for her. 

Her illness didn’t force her to hit someone. She made that decision. Like she made the decision to not take her meds. 

Yes, yes she does. You can’t go around just throwing a punch. God forbid that punch landed and hurt him. There’s no excuse for her. Or you for that matter
