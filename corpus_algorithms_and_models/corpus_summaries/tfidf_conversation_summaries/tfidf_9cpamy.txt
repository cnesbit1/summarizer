No, he didn't.  He asked a rhetorical question to point out that the answer was likely very obvious.  He said nothing against you personally, nor did he call you a name.

That sort of behavior will get you removed from this community.

That's not how anyone else took it.  You calling names, however, is a clear violation.
Uh yes.....he likes anything and everything that has to do with my butt ;)

You're right, I'm her Daddy and her fiancee and she's a good girl who follows all of Daddy's rules including no random PMs with men.  She's already told you I don't share so maybe it's you who needs to back off.
Sorry as Daddy already told you he would care.
