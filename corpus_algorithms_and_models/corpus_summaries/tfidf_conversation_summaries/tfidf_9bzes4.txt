Original Response:
Edit: It appears as if the app is experiencing heavy traffic. Some people have managed to get their codes(even multiple) but your mileage may vary

I got a [dragon emblem outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dragon_Emblem_Clothing_Outfit), guild wars 2: heroic edition rewards, and a [letter of influence???](https://i.imgur.com/EYzjIst.jpg)

Outfit must be redeemed via the gem store, heroic edition must be redeemed through your account page on https://account.arena.net/overview


NOTE: Make sure you redeem the outfit as an item code, not a gem code

Since you seem to have gotten it working, how do you find the codes to redeem?
Not sure about iOS, but on Android, click the menu on the top left and go to social rewards where you'll see the promo. Clicking on that should provide further instructions. Make sure not to hit the big red "rewards" section, as that is separate from the guild wars promo. Make sure you have a social media account linked(I used a fake twitter).
you're probably in a different timezone and it unlocked for you earlier than most of us :/

&gt; I used a fake twitter

Made a new twitter just to link it when I saw that the app will be able to:

* Read Tweets from your timeline
* See who you follow
* Follow new people
* **UPDATE YOUR PROFILE**
* **POST TWEETS FOR YOU**

Not a massive fan of apps being able to do those last two, also don't see any promo yet (from the UK) just the $1 photos on social media ones.
Doesn't matter. Link, claim, unlink. ðŸ˜‚
Which would be great if the promo even appeared in their app lol


EDIT: Annnnnd just like that, it appeared...
iOS only seems to allow Facebook/Instagram for me. For Twitter did you use Android?
I'm not seeing twitter on android either, just fb/instagram
I saw twitter available last night, but not this morning.
Sorry for the late response; I went to sleep

Press the 3 lines in the top left of the App &gt; Social Rewards &gt; Profile &gt; Connect Social Media Accounts &gt; Twitter

I did use Android so if this doesn't work on iOS I can't help further sorry.

Summary:
For Twitter did you use Android?
Make sure you have a social media account linked(I used a fake twitter).
