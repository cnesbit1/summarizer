Original Response:
I don't understand why he doesn't just move up to 185. He looks like a skeleton here.
He's going to.  Bro, he literally said that in this interview.
Did you watch the video? The whole video is him talking about his weight. He has a title shot at 170 so hes going to do it. Then if he wins maybe defend once and then hes moving up.

well fuck that.
why fuck that? i mean if he pulls a connor and holds up the division so he can call himself a simultaneous 2 division champ then yeah fuck that
guys that are like yeah i can't keep on making 170 shouldn't be competing for championships at 170.
i dont totally disagree but i see it more like 'this is my one chance to win a belt at 170 i have to go for it' and its hard to deny the man based on that
he's making a mockery of the sport, himself and the UFC first.
\*
easy to deny him based on missing weight and endangering himself.
lol

Summary:
He looks like a skeleton here.
