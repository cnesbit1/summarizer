I hate to be this guy, but why not just post this on the leafs sub?
Why not post it?
Because the only People who seem to be interested are leaf fans, at least jusfing by the flairs in this threat
I saw a couple of other flairs too. May I ask why it bothers you? I personally just skip over the content on /r/hockey that doesn't interest me.
Looked like they were playing /r/hockey to me
If everyone posted everything related to their teams in that teams sub then r/hockey would basically cease to exist.
You don't hate to be that guy because I've seen you post " r/leafs" before.

You're obsessed with hating on the leafs
Get over Tavares he likes Toronto more. Move on.
Does Tavares leaving still hurt? Get over it.
You've gotta be the Toronto hater I've ever seen, and I live in Montreal.
This guys entire existence is going on Reddit and hating on the Leafs/Tavares. The saltiest man alive.
I agree with you bro, there is nothing noteworthy about this goal but it hits the front page of hockey because its the Laughs, then their fans proceed to mock you for Tavares. Classic

Summary:
I hate to be this guy, but why not just post this on the leafs sub?
