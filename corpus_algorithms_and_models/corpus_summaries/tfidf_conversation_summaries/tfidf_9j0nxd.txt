Evolution is a scientific fact. It's true regardless of what people "believe" in the same way that gravity is a scientific fact regardless of your opinions about it.

You decry genocide and war, yet seem to have forgotten that God commanded Israel to engage in both of these things.

I believe that evolution is the mechanism God has used to create the diversity of life we see on earth.

If both Christianity and evolution are true, you either have to reconcile them or abandon one. Abandoning evolution is just denying reality.

We're not on earth to have an easy time. We're here to grow and learn which means facing and overcoming challenges.
Ahh, so that's your direction. Sorry, wrong.

Most of the time it was single-celled organisms fighting other single-celled organisms, which isn't bad in the slightest, because single-celled organisms cannot feel pain.

Humans have existed for a very short time comparatively.
Careful Geese, the brigade anti-theist downvoting may soon begin.
How could you deny scientific facts?

Thatâ€™s the better question
Lol what?
Both Christianity and evolution are true, no need to abandon either one. We were created than we evolved.
Except there actual proof we evolved. None whatsoever that we were created.
Ahh, yes, the magical ingredient of time, just wait long enough and everything becomes living tissue. It never occurs to most doubters that couldn't happen unless it was on a pre-existing template.

Summary:
Evolution is a scientific fact.
Abandoning evolution is just denying reality.
