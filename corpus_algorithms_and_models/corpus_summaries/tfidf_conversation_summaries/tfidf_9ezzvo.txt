Hello samstator!

I saw you got recently a shiny arceus from a twitter user, how did you get to know this user?
The user contacted me with the trade offer on my Tweet
Do you know if that user edited, hacked or cloned the event in any way?
I asked the user that several times throughout the trade discussion and also asked about save states this time around. They did state that no such methods were used to obtained the Arc and it was redeemed by the movie pre-order serial code
Would you mind pming me screenshots of the conversation?
Sure..
PMed a link... There might be some more stuff. It's a pretty long convo
Thanks for PMing iSlaiter with the link. He had to go for now. 

It looks like there are parts of the conversation that are cut off in some of those pictures. Can you retake the screenshots so that it shows everything? There are parts from @monpoke16 that are cut off and parts from you as well.

You can PM me the updated link when you have a chance to do so. Thank you!
Sure. I'll PM you the link when it's done. Cheers
PM'd links :)
Hello again samstator.

We have noticed you have some events in your spreadsheet that you got from twitter users and I would like to ask you to PM me the conversations you have for the following:

* Cosmo World Pikachu from ririrurrpoke
* PJCS Golduck from Lakia_poke163
* PC Mimikyu from 6V6U
* Zeraora from eru_to934

Thank you.
Sure. I'm not at home right now. I'll get back to you asap
Also, the convo with @eru_to934 moved to LINE app after the initial 1st Zeraora deal.. Should I send screenshots of that too?
Yes please.
Sent Golduck and MImikyu. Will send the other 2 now..
Thank you for sending the information above.  We are going to ask you to not offer any Pokémon obtained off-site for the time being. You may only offer Pokémon that you obtained yourself or traded for on this subreddit. Please remove all of these off-site Pokémon from your spreadsheet and any pending trade offers. 

Although you have made an attempt to ask the appropriate legitimacy-related questions in some instances, unfortunately there are still many key parts missing with the questioning and responses in the conversations you've shared with us. 

The purpose of you questioning your trading partners is to ensure the legitimacy of the Pokémon. Each trading community has different definitions of legitimacy, so you must be sure that your questioning adheres to *our* definition of legitimacy if you are to offer those Pokémon for trade on the subreddit.

Asking these questions is not just some hoop to jump through in order to trade these Pokémon on this subreddit. Our rules are in place because we are a subreddit dedicated to the trading of legitimate, legal, and uncloned Pokémon. You need to be sure that you can trust your trading partner, which means doing your due diligence in asking questions, researching your trading partner, and being 100% confident in the events you are trading for. If you trade with people you don't fully trust, but insist that you're confident that the Pokémon are legit, you are risking a permanent ban from the subreddit for lying about your Pokémon. **You** will be held responsible—not your trading partner.

When questioning traders from off-site, you should ask specific, targeted questions from "More FAQ on the rules" [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/faq#wiki_more_faq_on_the_rules) to ensure that the Pokémon follow *all* of the rules of the subreddit:

&gt; * Did you ask your trading partner whether or not they self-obtained the Pokémon? 
&gt; * Did you ask your trading partner whether or not the Pokémon is hacked, edited, cloned, or save state abused?
&gt; * Do you trust your trading partner to be telling you the truth about the previous two points?

&gt; If you did not question your trading partner as described above, it cannot be traded here.

&gt; Additionally, it is good practice to ask about things that may require [disclosure](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/policy#wiki_allowed_with_disclosure) on the subreddit, so that future trade partners can be fully informed as well.

&gt; Please note that moderators may ask questions to verify whether or not you have questioned your trading partners as appropriate. We have historically had many problems with people offering Pokémon from outside this subreddit, resulting in people offering Pokémon they shouldn't have.

********

With that being said, let's take a look at some of the key points missing in your trade conversations.  


Staring with @monpoke16 (relevant text copied from your screenshots): 

&gt; samstator: "Just to confirm the Arceus is not hacked or remodeled in any way right?"

&gt; samstator: "I was just asking if it is legitimate and not hacked by cheating or edited into the game?"

&gt; monpoke16: "I'm doing neither remodeling nor edit!"

&gt; samstator: "But I want to confirm, the Arceus was not Hacked into the Game or remodeled or anything like that right?"

&gt; samstator: "Also, did you use save state abuse for receiving this Pokemon? ... It means backing up a save file before receiving an event and then reverting back to that file to download the event multiple times."

&gt; monpoke16: "I don't approve a remodeling act of a backup."

&gt; samstator: "So the Arceus is completely legitimacy without hacking, remodeling or save state abuse?"

At no point is cloning mentioned in this conversation nor do you receive explicit confirmation/answers from monpoke16 in some of your follow-up questions. You cannot assume this shiny Arceus is legitimate by our standards based on the responses you received.

In your conversation with @6V6U where you traded for the PC Mimikyu, there is no answer to your question about save-state abuse.

For the conversations with @Lakia_poke163 and @eru_to934, you did not ask any of the specific questions regarding legitimacy. 


*******

Unfortunately, there are just too many red flags noted above for us to allow you to offer Pokémon from off-site. We do appreciate the questions you are asking regarding legitimacy, but there many instances of lack of questioning on your end in addition to missing information from your trading partners. As such, we feel that you have not adequately shown us that you are doing your due diligence as a trader.

You may appeal your restriction from offering Pokémon from off-site in the future by sending us a modmail. However for the time-being, you may only offer Pokemon that you obtained yourself or traded for on this subreddit.

If you appeal in the future, you must convince us that you know how to trade safely off-site. It is up to you to show us enough evidence that you have learned how trade safely with the appropriate questioning and that you are 100% confident in the Pokémon you are offering.



Here are a few tips to learn how trade safely:

- Ask many questions (not just the bare minimum). As linked above, the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/faq#wiki_more_faq_on_the_rules) has a lot of great information, including the section on questioning your trading partners.
- Never make assumptions. If the trader doesn't answer one of your questions, you cannot assume that the Pokémon is legitimate. 
- Do your research on your trading partners. There are many great tips on how to do this in our [avoiding scammers wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/scamming).

Until then, best of luck in your trades on our subreddit.

As an aside, please note that the moderators reserve the right to ask further questions to ensure the safety of the subreddit (as referenced in ["Notes on the rules"](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_notes_on_the_rules)). These things take time, so please be more patient in the future when waiting for a moderator response. We work together as a team and not all of us are in the same timezone to communicate with each other. Sending multiple PMs to the moderators about the "status" of your Pokémon does not help the situation. We will respond once we have spent the appropriate amount of time looking at everything and discussing the decision as a team. Thank you for understanding.
Understandable. However I believe @Lakia_poke163 is a reputable trader cause I have seen some of their mons being traded here. What if I ask all the user's you've mentioned all the details required including cloning and save state abuse? And the stance regarding @ririrurr_poke? I'm assuming those are clear as I've asked all them the questions needed?
Also the fact most of them have very little knowledge in the English language, hence I tried to dumb-down questions as much as possible. I will ask all of them once again the required questions if required
Since the trades have already occurred, asking questions after the fact does not confirm legitimacy unfortunately. All of these questions must be asked prior to a deal being struck. As such, these Pokemon may not be offered on this subreddit. Feel free to ask more follow-up questions for your own collection purposes, of course.

Even if you believe an off-site trader to be reputable, that doesn't mean that they will always adhere to our standards of legitimacy when trading with other users. You must ask these questions every time and unfortunately cannot rely on assumptions from other traders.

Thanks again for understanding and please let us know if you have further questions.
I just saw your edit.

To be clear, *all* off-site Pokemon are blocked from being traded here for now, including any Pokemon we haven't asked about. We've seen enough evidence from your conversations to make that call. Even if there is one instance of you asking all of the right questions, unfortunately we don't have enough reason on our end to allow that for the time-being. There are too many instances otherwise that show us that you haven't been as careful as you needed to be for our subreddit. We cannot spend the time to check everything you offer from off-site. 

Again as mentioned above, you may appeal this restriction in the future after some time has passed and you have learned how to trade safely. However, any Pokemon obtained prior to that time will not be allowed to trade on the subreddit.

I hope that helps clarify.
Yes. I will request tradeback for the Arceus and perhaps the MImikyu as well. Still have a question regarding ririrurr_poke. Could there be any exceptions for the Lakia_poke163 tho as the only they were the first I contacted regarding trades on Twitter and the only reason I did was because I did see reputable traders from this subreddit offerings events from them. And if I were to trade from the same users on Twitter having asked the same questions prior to the trade, I'm assuming those would be better?
And also regarding eru_to934, any future trades with them would have required questions asked before-hand right? I'm sorry if I was too lenient with the questions as like I said, I didn't want to intimidate them with too much English. I've also once resorted to Google translate to explain about save-state abuse  to a user :)
Gotcha. I will actually put my Twitter trades on halt for a while.
Sure, that part is your call since it's up to you if you'd like to continue trading off-site for your own collection purposes.

Regarding using google translate, that's a good idea to try to post both in English and in Japanese to help the users understand. We do appreciate you using simple language, too, to try to make sure the other traders understand your offers. 

A suggestion for the future might be to break up your questions a bit and only ask one at a time (in simple language, like you've mentioned). That way, you know you're getting the reply to one question at a time and it doesn't seem as overwhelming to the other user.
Understandable. I will take the mons mentioned off my sheet and add it to my personal collection. Thanks for telling me. And also regarding lakia_poke163, the use did state in our very initial trades a while that they do not resort to any 3rd part tool. Will send screenshot too if needed
For now, we'd still like to ask you not to offer any Pokemon from lakia_poke163 since it was obtained off-site (everything is blocked from off-site currently).

Even if they stated not using a 3rd party tool, that doesn't necessarily answer the self-obtained question or the cloning question. Each must be asked explicitly and clearly to make sure that the Pokemon adhere to our standards of legitimacy.
Understood. Darn it. The losses from my side tho haha. I guess that serves me right. Next time I trade off-site I will ask all the required questions. This will however be after a while tho. All good then?
We are good! Thank you for working with us and understanding our reasoning. We really do appreciate you being so forthcoming with all of the information and providing us with screenshots when requested. 

Good luck with your trades here!
Thanks. Rules are rules for a reason. See ya ;) #modsquad
Also.. a personal trade request from you here hahaha. I'm assuming you have 20th sets lying around as I've seen you trading them here and you've also traded them to me a while ago. What would you want for a 20th Set + Alexander Hoopa + Helen Volcanion ?
Haha I do have full sets available, plus the Hoopa and Volcanion (all info can be found in an [older thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/comments/8yn3yv/ft_old_events_wind_lugia_codes_lf_event_offers/) of mine).

Anyway, feel free to drop an offer on that thread and we can go from there! Probably looking for JPN PC events that I don't have or other comparable offers. You can see my collection linked in porybox on that thread as well.
For now, all I have on my sheet is what I have to offer. Lmk if you find something there :)
Ah, I must've forgotten to reply to your comment yesterday on my thread (sorry about that!)

I didn't see anything on your sheet this time, but maybe in the future!
Cool. Even if we could work with smaller sets, like 3 / 3 / 3 over a course of time, lmk. Cheers
