Original Response:
1. Something has always existed.
2. The something that has always existed is called, by naturalists, "the universe" and, by theists, "God".
3. The entity known as "the universe" or "God" really exists.

**Notes:**

P1. is backed by the empirical data: we've never seen a "nothing".

Perhaps more importantly, "nothing", I believe, is an impossible and inconceivable concept. You can't actually imagine true nothing. And you could never "see a nothing", because the simple fact that an observer exists to see, negates the idea of true nothingness. I believe we are left, always, with the claim "something always existed", based on the empirical data.

For P2. (that this always-existing something is called "God" or "the universe"), it is important to distinguish between "the universe"-- by which I here mean "the entire set of all real things, whether we have observed them yet or not"-- and the "observable universe"-- by which I mean "all real things we have observed". [spelling edit]

Final notes: This argument does not argue for the truth of any specific religion, or, most devastatingly, that God or the universe has a will. I do not know if it is possible to argue such a thing, at least in a simple manner.

This argument does indirectly argue for many characteristics/qualities of God, as "God" and "the universe" are interchangeable; they are just different names for the same fact (For example, "all-powerful" means something like "influence over all things"-- and what could influence absolutely all things except the system of all things itself? Naturalists call this the universe, and theists call this God.)

This argument does not defend use of the word "God" over "universe".

Summary:
The something that has always existed is called, by naturalists, "the universe" and, by theists, "God".
