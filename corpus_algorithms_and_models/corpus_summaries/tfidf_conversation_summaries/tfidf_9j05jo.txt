Hey ptrades, I've seen and had a few requests lately for non ENG events so just putting up a few today.

* 20th Celebi SPA
* 20th Victini SPA, GER, FRE 
* 20th Jirachi ENG, JPN
* 20th Manaphy SPA, FRE
* GER, JPN, ENG (Japan distribution shiny XYZ set) Also, have a few  "stray" shiny Xerneas and shiny Yveltal from other languages (SPA, etc).
 * Chymia Gardevoir (Timid/Modest) JPN/ENG (Lugia only)
* PC Hiroshima Magikarp (originated from YUKIJP and passed through another ptrades user before tracking was required) Various language tags
* Alexander Hoopa 
* All events self obtained unless noted
* 8 codes or best offer for single event. 12 codes for full XYZ sets. Rates negotiable.
* If you're looking for a specific language tag ask and I may have it.
Hello again, bi-cycle! I'm interested in Gardevoir, Hoopa and XYZ sets :)
You have Loogy right? Want to do 4 for the lot?
I'd actually would like to do some mix and match :) Kindly let me know the rates and I'll look into it

Edit: Will the lot include 2 Gardevoir, 3 XYZ sets and Alexander Hoopa?
I have previously traded a single XYZ set for two Lugia codes and Chymia at 1:1.

If my other trade goes through I will be set on poipole codes so I'd just be looking for Lugia.
Yes, I was actually the one who traded you two Lugia codes xD. May I kindly see the proofs? If they look good, I might take the offer
Haha sorry, I've traded lots of people for Lugia so I don't remember every transaction.  

At work so I can't upload anything right now but depending on what we traded before you may already have seen it. XYZ and Hoopa will have farm proof. Chymia will have full redemption proof as it came from a code.
Got it. Will wait for you then :) Also, do you happen to still have a few 20th Pokémon?
Of the 8 listed pjay is taking 3 but we haven’t talked specifics. So, I’ll have 5 left. If you want something in particular let me know.
If you have another Hoopa, that would be great. Otherwise, I'm interested in both Jirachis
Ok, can you give me a list of the events you wanted?
To finalize, that would be:

* XYZ sets
* Gardevoir (2)
* Hoopa
* Jirachi (2)
* Any other 20th left
Sent proof/Chymia sample. 

* XYZ 1 of each GER, ENG, JPN
* Gardevoir x2
* Hoopa 
* Jirachi (2)
* remaining 20th would be Manaphy (1) Celebi (1) Victini (2) Jirachi (1)

Assuming you want them all that would be 12 Lugia codes.
Are we doing 2 codes each for the XYZ set?
Yeah
I may have overpaid last time since somebody traded their XYZ set for 1 Lugia code. I'll have to reconsider the XYZ sets.

I'm still interested in Gardevoir, Hoopa, Jirachi, Manaphy, Victini, Celebi. I saw a Hoopa being traded for 6 NA codes.

The best I could do for the lot excluding the XYZ would be 4-5 codes, and everything would be 7-8 codes
That's alright, value is subjective so not everyone will have the exact same rate for every event. I think I'm pretty fair when it comes to these things so I'm comfortable with my suggested rates. 

I can trade Gardevoir 1:1 and the others at 2:1 so let me know which ones you'd like.
What you said is true, as I agree that the way we value pokemon is different from each other. Although for me, I value the Lugia codes higher xD

For now, I'm not sure how many codes I still have left after these reservations, but I'll definitely get Gardevoir, Manaphy, Jirachi, Hoopa
I can't talk money here because I don't want to get banned haha but I do take various Pokemon trading subs into consideration.

If you'd like to trade now that will be 4 codes for the selected mons.
Hello, bi-cycle. I can trade now, if you happen to be available. Also, will it be possible to request for another 20th as an extra or exchange it for NA codes?
I’m not available just now but I can message you later when I’m free. I don’t need any NA codes at the moment but if I’m able to redeem the ones I currently have I will be looking for more in the future.
I'm free to trade now if you are.
Hey there, did you still want to do this? Last day!
Ugh, I keep on missing your reply! How many codes do I owe you for the Pokemon?
It was 4 for the ones you wanted.
Oh, okay. I'm no longer interested in some of the 20ths. I will just finalize everything first. 

* Gardevoir (2)
* Alexander Hoopa
* Helen Volcanion
* 20th Genesect
* 20th Jirachi

If you are okay with trading everything for 3 Lugia codes, I will send the codes any moment now.
Well, I mentioned in my comment earlier that I could trade the Gardevoir at 1:1 and the others at 2:1 to which you replied with the Pokemon you wanted for a total of 4 codes. If you'd only like to trade 3 codes now we'll need to drop a Gardevoir or two of the other Pokemon.
Some incident happened that made me view the 20ths as something lesser than before. I think I will be firm with my request and offer. 

Edit: I only need one of these each aside from the Gardevoir
If we cannot agree on the rate for the others would you just like two Gardevoir for two codes then?
I only need one of each listed aside from Gardevoir (2). 

If you think otherwise, I'll pass for now, since I'd like them as a set. Thank you and I'm really sorry.
Ok, that's fine

Summary:
I'm interested in Gardevoir, Hoopa and XYZ sets :)
Are we doing 2 codes each for the XYZ set?
I can trade now, if you happen to be available.
12 codes for full XYZ sets.
I'm free to trade now if you are.
I have previously traded a single XYZ set for two Lugia codes and Chymia at 1:1.
If my other trade goes through I will be set on poipole codes so I'd just be looking for Lugia.
