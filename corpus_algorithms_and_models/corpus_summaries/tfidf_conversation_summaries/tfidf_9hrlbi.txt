So illegal immigrants get an all expenses paid stay here in canada while their claims are processed, but we can't even properly look after our veterans? Makes me sick 

Those illegal immigrants shouldn't be ahead of anyone in line for government funds. Even more insulting, most of them are found to have had legal status in the Us, further proving that the bulk of them are merely asylum shoppers
It's possible to walk and chew gum at the same time.
"Man suddenly cares about veterans and the homeless after he finds out about refugees"
That's pretty pretentious way to undercut a good point.

This isn't either-or.
It's not either-or, but when's the last time you heard conservatives saying we needed to do more for the poor and homeless except when complaining about refugees?
You're justifying engaging the same pretenses.

Instead of giving the pretense up.
It's not actually either-or. Which is why it's bullshit when people who don't otherwise care about the homeless say we could be taking care of the homeless. 

If the anti-refugee people weren't the same people always cutting social programs that, y'know, help the homeless, maybe I'd care what they thought of money we could be spending on the homeless.
Funny you mention either-or when I'm poking fun at some one applying either-or to our refugee situation.

I don't know what that guys intention is but it sure looks shady when you only mention our veterans as an attempt to shit on refugees.
&gt;Which is why it's bullshit when people who don't otherwise care about the homeless say we could be taking care of the homeless.

Ad hominem attack.

You still havent refuted the argument that illegal crossers shouldnt be getting money before vets.

It doesnt matter if they look shady or not, their argument is either valid or not.

Saying “youre a hypocrite” doesnt refute the argument.
&gt;You still havent refuted the argument that illegal crossers shouldnt be getting money before vets.

Because it's a stupid argument. Vets do get money. The amount spent on refugees is insignificant compared to vets. 

If you're saying we should spend $0 on refugees until everything vets get everything they could possibly want, you're simply anti refugee and vets have nothing to do with it.
&gt; Vets do get money. 

Not enough to cover their needs. They are even denied service dogs.

&gt;The amount spent on refugees is insignificant compared to vets. 

No it isn't. The Federal government alone has spent over $120 million on illegal crossers, that would go along way towards meeting Vets' needs.

&gt;If you're saying we should spend $0 on refugees until everything vets get everything they could possibly want, you're simply anti refugee and vets have nothing to do with it. 

"Everything they could possibly want"

This is a huge strawman argument. They aren't asking for everything, they asking for enough to cover their medical needs.

Also, why should non-Canadians get any money while there are still Canadians in need?

I'm criticizing him for using veterans as a political tool to shit on refugees.
Okay. That still doesn't refute their argument.

You might successfully point them out as hypocrites, but their point still stands.

Compare that to billions.

&gt;
&gt;Also, why should non-Canadians get any money while there are still Canadians in need?

Because, if done properly, helping refugees get established in Canada is actually a good moral thing to do. Maybe you don't place value on human life unless they're Canadian, but I do.

It's not a zero sum game. We can spend enough on veterans, take in genuine refugees, and process and deport people who don't prove refugee status. By asking the question you're the one making it an either-or proposition.
&gt;Compare that to billions. 

I have. $120 million would still make a big difference in many vets' lives.

Just because its a small percentage of a huge budget doesn't mean you can ignore the impact on individuals.

&gt;Because, if done properly, helping refugees get established in Canada is actually a good moral thing to do.

And taking proper care of vets is not (which we aren't doing)?

You act if there is no opportunity to cost the money being spent on refugees.

&gt; Maybe you don't place value on human life unless they're Canadian, but I do.

Yes. I place more value on a Canadians' life than a non-Canadians' life.

We have a responsibility to Canadians first and foremost.

&gt;It's not a zero sum game.

It is LITERALLY a zero sum game. Do you not know how money works?

There is only X dollars to go spend, and dollars spent on one thing can't be spent on another. Once you have spent all X dollars, you will have zero left to spend.

That is, by definition, a zero sum game.

&gt;We can spend enough on veterans, take in genuine refugees, and process and deport people who don't prove refugee status.

No we can't. We don't have enough to properly cover veterans' needs as it is.

How on earth do you think you are going to afford to do it all?
well when you realize money is finite, you kinda tend to prioritize where it should be spent...
Why are you bringing up refugees ? Are you trying to conflate illegal (irregular) immigrants and refugees for political advantage ?
That's such a stupid fucking analogy.

We don't have infinite money.  It's not at all possible to pay for everything

I'm pretty sure that's an actual Beaverton article.
Hes obviously talking about the refugee claimants at the border. Many of whom were granted refugee status.

Also it triggers the right wingers.
Veterans are not at this point denied service dogs. The report only was handed in seven weeks ago. It takes more than seven weeks for any government department to make a decision. Anybody who has been in the military, and I mean anybody, understands that the wheels of government move slowly. If they approve service dogs based on this report it’s going to take some time before that happens, just like it took time to approve medical cannabis for veterans but it happened.  They haven’t made a decision yet about service dogs.  As for you, you did what most people do, you only read the headline and not the entire article. That is why I know they have only had the report for seven weeks. 

Canadian military veterans don’t only have support from Veterans Affairs. We also have access to the public service health care plan and pensioners dental services plan.  Veterans with 20+ years also have their Canadian forces tension. Depending on age they also have CPP and OAS.  Medical coverage for veterans in general is extremely good but unfortunately because Canadians, probably people like you, complain every time they have to pay more taxes, it’s hard to give departments the substantive increases in personnel and funding that they need to fully support their mandates and that goes across all government departments. ￼ 

Don’t use an issue concerning veterans as a way to promote anti-refugee hatred. This is not the Donald. We don’t need hate speech in here.  

There will always be Canadians in need. There will always be people who struggle. That doesn’t mean we leave thousands of people to die in horrible conditions just because they weren’t born here.  Fortunately this is not Donald Trump’s America or Stephen Harpers Canada.
So...any issue where the government might need to do better is an excuse to complain about immigration?

Who said anything about conservatives? People don't need to be conservative to care about the law and veterans.

I mean yeah, it's one thing to not let your deadbeat brother sleep on the couch, it's another to not let your deadbeat brother sleep on the couch while inviting dozens of random homeless people to sleep on the couch. It's wrong.
Do better? What do you even mean? They cut funding and say they can't afford to pay what the veterans want but at the same time able to pull money out of no where for the illegal immigrants?
I'm aware that we need to do more for our vets. I'm not up on the details of the current discussion.

My point is that for those who are anti-immigrant, any time a program needs more money (ie. all of them all of the time) this comparison will always be seen as a propos because they want to see no money spent on these people they fallaciously refer to as illegal immigrants. It's an excuse to grind an axe. Thus my previous comment.
You have decoded r/Canada's super secret encryption!
This is a classic misconception of the left. "We have unlimited money to pay for everything, we should just do all of it". You call conservatives immoral when they are just living in reality. In the real world you have to pay for what you spend, and if you don't, you pay interest. If you do that consistently over time you will bankrupt your country and you won't have anything. All those benefits you love to throw around go away. The moral thing to do is to not spend above our means and to take care of the people who pay taxes and who serve our country. Not to people who have never paid for any of the benefits and have sacrificed nothing for our country.
Why do you people confuse the issue? Immigration is good, illegal immigration is bad. How can't you see that?
I don't know. It just seems to escape me somehow. I'll keep trying though. /s
Thanks. I'm thrilled to have accomplished this. And all it took was a few minutes with my commie-pinko-leftie secret decoder ring. :-)
Don't forget that Trudeau is responsible for all decisions at all levels of government past, present and future.

In the real world, making sure the people who "have never paid for anything" have the basics necessary for a comfortable life leads to a more prosperous country. Instead of growing up poor and hungry, kids are able to focus on school and do better than their parents. Instead of working two jobs because minimum wage doesn't pay enough, people have the time to improve themselves and do better. Instead of welfare kids being destined to the same fate as their parents, get them a good education and more than the absolute minimum so they see the world beyond the welfare check every month and watching TV 24/7. Instead of waiting until it's a much bigger deal and they need emergency surgery, people go to the hospital right away.

What's not good for the economy is people who are already rich having more. There is no trickle down. People don't raise salaries because they're making profits, they raise them because they have to in order to retain employees.

Your understanding of the left is short sighted. You're better off fixing your roof as soon as a bit of water starts getting in. Yeah, it'll cost more up front, but you'll save yourself a rotten roof and water all over your stuff.
Well that's a giant strawman. You know exactly who I was talking about when I said "people who have never paid for any of the benefits and have sacrificed nothing for our country." I'm not talking about poor or sick Canadians. I'm talking about illegal immigrants that came here because they torched their own country with socialism, or fled America because they're upset about their new president.   


I'm all for taking care of kids with better schools and giving them the means they need to grow up to contribute to society and lead a happy life. When you prioritize non-citizens you are taking resources away from those kids. I was that kid, I've been a liberal my whole life. Liberalism used to be about taking care of **OUR** own citizens who needed a temporary hand, whether it be paying for their medical care, or giving them access to a quality education for free. Now liberalism is all about virtue-signalling about diversity and going after people for wrongthink.  


I completely agree with you that conservative policies that favour the rich are wrong and it's the job of the left to fight against those policies, so how about the left get back to doing that rather than policing speech, worrying about people's feelings and bankrupting our country to buy votes.
You're the one creating a strawman here. 

Nobody is arguing we should prioritize spending on illegal immigrants. Maybe a few anarchists who don't believe in borders. That's about it. 

What people **are** saying is that evaluating every refugee claim before shipping people back to maybe get killed is a moral and legal duty, and that during the time they're here you have to at least make sure they have the most basic things to sustain life. It's the exact same thing you do when you arrest someone and they haven't had their trial yet. You don't just execute or imprison everyone you arrest; no matter how certain you are of their guilt, they get their neutral evaluation (trial in the case of criminals). 

Yes, many or even most of the current wave of border hoppers will have their claims denied. But this process is necessary to ensure we aren't sending people back to torture or death. 

What you're framing as prioritizing illegal immigrants over veterans is right-wing fear mongering. There is no mainstream opinion that we should take in every person who crossed the border.
When illegal immigrants are posted up in hotels while veterans are out on the streets and victims of apartment fires are out on the streets that's prioritizing illegal immigrants. When Justin Trudeau posts a tweet saying everyone is welcome in Canada which leads to hundreds of millions of dollars in expenditures to deal with a massive influx of illegal immigrants that's prioritizing illegal immigrants. We used to have a moral and fair refugee system in this country. All we are asking for is that we ditch the policy by twitter and by virtue signalling and start making decisions for Canadians first. Once our citizens are taken care of then by all means let's help others. But this government has made it very clear that global citizens are the priority over Canadian citizens.
