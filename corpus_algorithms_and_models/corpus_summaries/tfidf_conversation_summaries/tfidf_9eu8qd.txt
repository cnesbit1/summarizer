Custom flairs: here are two ways to obtain a custom flair:

- place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
- draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Whats going on amongst the Dagestanis? Seems like lots of talk and flutter today on social media about something i cant work out?
Theyâ€™re getting together to form one giant nurmagomedmagomedshapirov
Send lokation meet at bridge
is it about the rant that Khabib went on about he hates concerts on instagram.. https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnj5CJ6HKig/?taken-by=khabib_nurmagomedov
No! Not Mega-Nurmagomedmagomedshapirov!
What the hell is he talking about? From the translation I gathered he hates that Dagestani men are participating in concerts and shit and he wants to return them to what they should be? Idk the translation was tough 

A total irrelevant anecdote, Khabib kind of cute tho it sucks if I told him he would try to stone me to death
That was part of what i saw yeah. And a few others like Zabeast etc also talking about him / the country / concerts. I have no idea what any of it means though, the guys seem ruffled.
Also cant work any of it out. Agreed on some of the uncomfortable realities of his religious conviction. Can only hope his new worldly experiences drag him a little further away from those extrememist beliefs.
yea pretty much it, he hates concerts and hates the Dagestani's are embracing it, sounds like how an elder would say bad things about the new generation to be honest, 
and LOL, i dont think he would stone u for that lol, he's spent a lot of time in the U.S now and he pretty good with these type of situations, would probably laugh
He basically hates that the new generation of Dagestani's are more liberal and is expressing his opinion on the issue
He's come a long way but i think there is still ways to go
Kids these days and their concerts! Back in my day we wrestled the bears and ran up the mountains!
What a chode.
And even in Dagestan you don't get killed for being gay, or very rarely, by extremists, not young people
I think Khabib might hold some opinions a lot of people would frown upon if he were to openly disclose them
Really talking the place up.
