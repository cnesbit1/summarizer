Original Response:
Was hoping someone could help me out with some Pokémon to complete my dex in ultra moon. The Pokémon I need are 

Castform, Baltoy, Golett, Weavile, Vanillite, Relicanth, Misdreavous

Can offer a k/g code 

Thanks
I'm not sure what that code is, but I can get you everything other than the weavile!
Awesome I just added you on DS
Let me find everything and breed you a mon real fast.
Alright sounds good
Do you have the item razor claw?
You can find one... Somewhere.. Idr where. But the weavile i have is for the livingdex.
Can I just see the weavile? I’ll trade it back
Oh, that'll work.
Alright cool, let me know when I should head to plaza
Your order is ready for pick up! We will trade back the weavile first and then you can keep everything else.
Alright sounds good heading to plaza now
Thanks a lot man! I really appreciate it. Do you want the Kg code?
Sure!
PMing code now, thanks again
