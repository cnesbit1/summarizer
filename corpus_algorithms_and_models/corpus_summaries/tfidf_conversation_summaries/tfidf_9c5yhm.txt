But the difference is the same whether you use K or C.  The difference is the same so the rate is the same (but in opposite direction)

The difference is still +/-1 though?  Newton's law doesn't use percentages unless I'm mistaken...

You threw me off with Newton's law.  I was assuming a constant rate constant between the two cases.

You forgot that the proportionality constant in Newtonâ€™s law of cooling is also dependent on temperature and that dependency is non linear. The proportionality constant depends on the geometry and airflow around the material. Also a hot object will emit radiation which varies with temperature to the 4th power and conduction which varies non linearly with temperature in most materials as well.
