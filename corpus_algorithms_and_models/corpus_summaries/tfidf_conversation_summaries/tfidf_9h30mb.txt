Just wait wen the ETF gives a green light it will go. Dont be afraid to buy between these numbers BUY THE DIP !!
And what if ETF is delayed/declined? All the noobs are going to dump it down to 5400 (at least).
They wont !!
They wont what? Decline or dump? Or both? :D
Decline and dump 6500$ is nothing for BTC ore 200 Bilion in MC its a penny fore the market
Awww maaan. You must be new here :) Sheep in crypto get scared easily because most of them are young and never invested before, plus they are in it for lambos and shit. That being said, I hope for the approval and a nice pump :) but I'm not selling before 2022.

you throw away your hardware every week? my laptop is 9 years old.
I'm joking, but a 9 year old laptop? Damm son you can overdo it though :p
yeah, still works well for web, movies and music. Battery only lasts a couple of hours now so i probably should get a new one of them. I spend my spare money on other things these days.

Summary:
