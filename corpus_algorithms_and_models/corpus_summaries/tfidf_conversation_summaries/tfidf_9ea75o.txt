Anyone see Snoop’s [ignorant-ass IG post](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnfc0F0gaKx/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=1lx0f9sszntye)  about the Till Woodley fight?
No, what did he say?
What a bellend.
It’s not really ignorant
Snoop is an absolute moron. Complete waste of human matter.

lmao I think he's confusing Till with Colby.

"King Kong" and a video of the submission.

He's basically calling all white people racist, saying "fuck donald trump" (referring to till) whilst till is getting hammered when all till and trump share with each other is that theyre both white. "For all the niggas out there whoop this motherfucker" - snoop dogg.

Racist as fuck from snoop dogg, fuck that guy


Either that or he's somehow mixing till and Covington up?
What was it?
But Khabib is his boy right? He’s white. And non of us should really be high on Russia right now.
Why do white people have such thin skin about race?  I'm white and I noticed t wood is not allowed to talk about race at all.
He obviously thought woodley was fighting Colby.  I'm sorry this old stoner doesn't know that much about mma
[removed]
you're not wrong....it was pretty obvious
[removed]
Thats all Woodley talks about. He thinks hes a mega star draw and accuses the ufc of being racist and holding him back. There's about 4 massive draws and he'll never be one of them because he lacks what's needed, appealing smack talk and a whole country behind ya, or else a fan base from other areas. Not many people get/have that. His argument about the ufc is the exact same arguemnt stipe miocic makes about them. I doubt that stipe and tyron are treated the same way due to racism, as I'm sure you know, one is black and one is white.
Lol Snoop is such a racist fuck
I don't see that being all he talks about.  I see white people who don't like black people talking about race.  I did see a under experienced white Connor wannabe who barely makes weight get a huge push over a dominant champion.
No, that is what tyron is known for, watch his podcast with Joe rogan for example. Till got the push for having a county behind him and because if you look at YouTube videos of the lead up to this fight he massively outviews Woodley therefore having more interest from the public. Wonderboy didn't get anywhere near the push till got, Till has been getting this push since before he fought wonderboy even. It's not race, its who's got the potential to earn the ufc more money
Or wins either.
What?
The guy who's winning more got less push than the guy who might win
Till was undefeated coming into that fight. The public's reaction to fighters is what gets the ufc to push fighters, not if they are champion (for example stipe who is white and a firefighter, he got zero push) or anything else, its a business that cares about money
Lost to the scale twice.
Don't think that suddenly makes you not a draw. Again 
, all they care about is fan response to fighters to make money. Look at sugar Sean o malley, a massive response to his fights with snoops commentary, he's nowhere near a title shot but he's getting a big push due to popularity. Again, being champion or whatever doesn't matter to them, they care about money therefore marketability. Look at the push the black man Francis ngannou got, he then went on to get destroyed by a white guy with a grudge with the ufc for not getting a push like the black man got. Stipe, nor the public, thought it had anything to do with colour, so how is it different for tyron when the situation is the exact same as stipes. Plenty of evidence there that it's not about colour with the ufc.
Okay then explain why wins don't matter to dana
What are you on about? The fact they pushed francis, when he was fighting Stipe, literally puts to bed what you and tyron are saying. How do you explain that push for francis? Just answer that. I now think you're just trolling at this stage.
I'm not talking about Francis.  I'm talking about the fight in the thread you are commenting in

Couldn't believe the hate for Woodley and the comments that people were making thinking he was 'boring'. Some people really have a short term memory man. Woodley is a beast! (I know he's cringe sometimes though lol)
&gt;and the comments that people were making thinking he was 'boring'. 

He's a boring fighter that occasionally has a watchable gif.
His past 2 fights have been boring, but apart from that, his fights have not been boring.
He was amazing last night

His last two championship defenses before last night were Arlovski Sylvia III bad.
He's finished 6 of his 9 UFC wins.
And the leadup to those finishes is almost always boring. The one good fight he's had is the Nate fight.
Rewatch Woodley Wonderboy 1 and tell me that it's not boring.
Watching it in the moment live was not boring at all, as opposed to Woodley Thompson 2 or the Maia fight. Watching Woodley Thompsons 1 it after the event, knowing the result makes it boring
&gt;Watching it in the moment live was not boring at all

If a fight is only entertaining because you don't know the result then it's a boring fight.
Um, no. He has had alot of boring fights. All the way back to strikeforce. Hes not always boring, but his style is such that he is very hit or miss. You are the one with short memory
Saying he's not boring is having a short term memory
[removed]
"Sorry sir, but you're highlight reel finishes of high level opposition are not exciting enough".
Correct.

Summary:
He has had alot of boring fights.
I don't see that being all he talks about.
I'm talking about the fight in the thread you are commenting in.
I'm not talking about Francis.
What are you on about?
&gt;and the comments that people were making thinking he was 'boring'.

Thats all Woodley talks about.
Watching Woodley Thompsons 1 it after the event, knowing the result makes it boring.
