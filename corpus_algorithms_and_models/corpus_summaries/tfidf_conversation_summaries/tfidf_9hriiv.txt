They have killer prices. Are they legit or no? I saw a joyetech dolphin for 14.99 and they’re giving me a myblu kit for $1 so I gotta know!! And how fast is their shipping? Thanks!!
They are legit... Shipping is iffy, they drop ship some items so it could take up to 10-14 days or as fast as 2-3.
What is drop ship?
After an order they wait for someone else to ship the product to them before shipping it to you.
Even if you pay for faster shipping ?
yup,  they can only ship what the "have".... so once they get it,  they will ship it,  but if that takes a week etc....   I do believe they present in your cart now whether they have the item in stock themselves or not,   I know there was some kind of change in the last few months....
Yeah that's just faster from their door to yours, no effect on processing times or if it needs to be drop shipped. It isnt everything... I have ordered from them 4 times I think and had it be everything from 2 weeks to a few days.
So, you were never disappointed, always authentic??
Where do they shop from?
I ordered juice a few times and coils I think... No issues with authenticity personally. They ship out if New Jersey i think, somewhere in the North East.
Oh okay so I’m in OBX, NC so it’ll be faster then CA
They would be faster if all the items are coming from them. Keep in mind if something isn't coming from their warehouse, it basically needs to be shipped twice.
And how do you know if it’s directly from them?
Thats not how it works at least in my case. I order Fuggin Vapor juice from them because it's cheaper and I dont have to pay tax but Fuggin is only about 30 miles away from me so they "drop ship" it. In this case it comes to me straight from Fuggin not from Breazy and I usually get it next day even with the free shipping.
30.0 miles ≈ 48.3 kilometres ^(1 mile ≈ 1.6km)
