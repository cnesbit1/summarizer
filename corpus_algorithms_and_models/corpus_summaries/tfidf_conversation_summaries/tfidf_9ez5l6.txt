Original Response:
After leaving the Catholic Church I’ve decided to devote time to studying what I actually believe. I know I believe in a God that’s immaterial and is the first cause. But the nature of Jesus and the trinity is a much more shakey thing. Christianity hinges on the fact that Christ claims to be the messiah and the Son of God. If he’s not, then it’s false.

It’s that simple.

A few questions:

1. Jesus was a Jew. If the goal of Christianity is to be Christ like then why is there not more pressure to affirm Jewish traditions and cultures when Jesus, the religions patriarch, was a Torah affirming Jew?

2. The New Testament is inconsistent on the nature of Jesus’ divinity. Throughout the NT Jesus routinely and very commonly says nothing goes through to the father without him or that he needs his father’s permission. Throughout the NT Jesus describes himself almost as a mediator FOR God and not to be literally God. Therefore the trinitarian outlook seems to be completely against Jesus’ own words. Which makes the religion look like a cult of personality more than anything else.

3. Therefore, if Jesus isn’t God and all his prophecies didn’t even come true, then why follow him? If that’s the case and you believe in the God of Abraham then you must realize you aren’t in actual covenant with him. If that’s the case Judaism is the only natural course so you can gain covenant with the God you believe in.

I watched this video last night. I’ve been full of doubts for days, it helped.

Summary:
If that’s the case Judaism is the only natural course so you can gain covenant with the God you believe in.
If that’s the case and you believe in the God of Abraham then you must realize you aren’t in actual covenant with him.
