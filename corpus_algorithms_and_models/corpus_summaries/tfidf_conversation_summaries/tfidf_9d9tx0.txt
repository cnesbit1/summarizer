Original Response:
Ford did this when he started the River Rouge plant.  Step off the line for any reason and fired.  Foreman could not let anyone off the line and was there to basically scream and terrify the men.  The men would stuff sheets down their pants to avoid soiling their clothes.  If you had the shits, you worked in your diarrhea all day.
Ugh god, reminds me of the new texas chainsaw massacre. Where she's begging and crying to her boss for a bathroom break, and he says 'fuck off slacker', and her miscarriage slithers down her leg.
Jesus wtf
Wow. I thought Ford paid and treated his workers well?
That's what I remember reading in school. Probably just a plan to make young men in poverty think that back breaking labor is the right thing to do because megacorp really do care about you.

He had his own spy service, spying on his workers, keeping track of who was cheating on their wife, who drank booze.  He paid $5 per day (a lot at the time) and thought this made him their ‘daddy’.

If you didn’t go to church on Sunday, you could be fired.

Oh, and it’s highly believed but never proved, that Ford **funded Hitler** when the NSDAP was near bankruptcy.  Hitler sent a henchman to America and the man came home with equivalent of 250,000 gold Reichmarks, saving Hitler from bankruptcy.
There's this persistent myth among American workers that Ford "gave us" things like the eight hour workday and vacation time and stuff like that, to "keep his skilled workers," and that this pressured other industries to do the same. This is false. Nothing we hold now was ever "given" to us, not even for the most skilled workman. All laborers are replaceable. We have generations of workers who literally fought and died to win the rights we have today. [Children as young as thirteen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_View_massacre) were gunned down striking just for the eight hour workday. Men, women and even children have been murdered even by our own national guard (one such incident was the Ludlow Massacre, the Colorado National Guard lit their tents on fire...).

Many of these incidents of violence are [listed here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worker_deaths_in_United_States_labor_disputes). I also recommend looking into the Harlan County Coal War and the Battle of Blair Mountain.
Damn you dumb as a stack of bricks aye. ?

I’m simply curious as to why you mix cases, upper and lower?
