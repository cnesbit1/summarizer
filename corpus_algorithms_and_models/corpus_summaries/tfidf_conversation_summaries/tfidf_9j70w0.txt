Original Response:
This is undeniably the biggest conspiracy theory in recent years and there is a wealth of information on both sides of this topic, I clearly have my opinion but like for it to be challenged because thats how we gain better perspective. 

I feel like all these filler posts are distraction from either side. 

There is a case to be made that
1. **Russia and Trump colluded to influence the election**
2. **The “deep state” is trying to get Trump out of power by framing him and his colleagues**
3. ** This is all a show to distract us from something larger at work and both sides are probably chummy with each-other **

Personally my guess is 1. Because of the information Ive looked up and processed. But I could be completely fucking wrong and thats the point. 

#All three of these are conflicting possibilities that deserve some analysis. 

I get its divisive and not some 100% guilty sort of case at all but I dont get how not a single person here is even talking about it, its a pretty big deal and theres mountains of circumstantial evidence around it. I personally think theres something weird but dont have a conclusion, I’d really prefer to discuss it as a community and not as political shills. Can we just act like the information is about another country’s leader and try and analyze it objectively? 

I dont get this sub, we literally have a huge conspiracy we could try and unravel and discuss but everyones more interested in what time biased ass CNN airs their interview with the attention whore Abenetti. 

I want some objective discussion about this, discussing issues with it and credibility towards it, we cant just ignore such a huge possible conspiracy with a plethora of info surrounding it and still act like this is a conspiracy subreddit. If this isn’t some political shill subreddit speak up because it really feels like this is just the new place to bash MSM (which Im fine with as long as its significant) and post bullshit. I’m really curious about this whole thing and really want to hear others opinions and perspectives.  I dont get how THIS PLACE of all places is just ignoring it despite the meaningless political posts that get upvoted to the front. 

If you wanna discuss it and bring evidence and counter evidence I think we should finally have at it. Its clear there isn’t NOTHING there so why is no one curious about whats going on and what plea deals people like Cohen and Manafort made. THIS is a conspiracy, either by Trump or the “deep state” (which I personally think is more an illusion of power sorta thing). 

Just discuss your opinion and try and provide articles with factual sources or meaningful anecdotes because I think this is the most compelling conspiracy in a long time IF IT IS TRUE, which we dont know. 

EDIT: pointing out I cant respond to anyone because I was banned by a mod without warning for cursing at someone! But censorship isnt real! Especially not on a free thinking sub like r/conspiracy

Pathetic moderation and no response after I was trying to reach out to them.
Republican Comey, whose announcement about the Clinton email investigation helped Trump, was leading the investigation until Trump fired him. Rosenstein, a Republican and Trump appointee, named Republican Mueller as special counsel to run the investigation. The investigations in congress are/were chaired by Republicans.

It's all a Democrat conspiracy, for sure.
Well its clear these are all just democrats posing as republicans for decades just so they had their chance to commit and frame the most complex conspiracy ever done.
I am floored every time someone tries this argument with a straight face. Did you somehow forget how hated Trump was (and is) by certain Republicans, *especially* the three letter agency, neocon types. 

Did you forget the [McCain](https://i.imgur.com/KjAo8nT.png) Funeral, where they carted out a bipartisan parade of the most psychopathic war criminals of the past 50 years to bash Trump in eulogy?  Who is saying this is simply a Democrat conspiracy?
Too bad for you it's all true.
It's actually on both sides of the aisle. 

Neither the establishment Dems or Rs wanted Trump in office.

John McCain was personally involved with the dossier getting to the State Department.
It's good that they put the country before a con man.
Who is they?
Sure it is mate. It's not like the investigators leaked stories to news outlets, then used those stories as a pretext to go after more people. 

Oh wait they did and there is indisputable proof in their own words.

To anyone who actually wants to discuss the post instead of insult people, can you think of any way these texts are ok?
Don't wait too long for a reply that isn't coming.
You provided a list.
When was it announced that the Trump campaign was under investigation?
Sorry to burst your bubble.
Because we all know the [***Hegelian***](https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS752US752&amp;q=Hegelian&amp;spell=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja4cnOmtrdAhVEmK0KHWzIC_sQkeECCCooAA) Dialectic isn't real and Comey, a former communist, working with Rosenstein, a zionist, would never have dual alliances to protect something bigger. No one is as ideologically bent as you seem to be unless they are lying to themselves.
Lol
No, you didn't address any of the sources OP listed. Your reply has added nothing of value to the conversation besides sliding this 'discussion' as far as you can.
Cool. Have a nice night. Some of us have to work in the morning.

It seems pretty clear there’s an agenda here and it has nothing to do with telling the truth
What makes you say they put the country before McCain?
Yes, all these Republicans who Trump appointed are out to get Trump...for some reason...
What makes McCain a 'con man'?
9/11 was complex. RussiaGate: significantly less so (especially given the media hates Trump, ergo is less than skeptical of things that seem worthy of skepticism).

Russia was definitely astroturfing, but so were numerous other factions and the overall effectiveness of Russia's shenanigans [is debatable](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/). And stuff like the staged DNC "hack" (which was used as the reason for [Obama to ask James Clapper](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/07/24/clapper_obama_ordered_the_intelligence_assessment_that_resulted_in_mueller_investigation.html) for the [2017 ICA](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) ) is pretty easy to stage if the authorities play along (which they largely did). If you look at details discussed by various critiques of the DNC "hack" the whole thing's so sketchy it's almost funny (especially if you have some IT knowledge).

Just some of the official narrative: the DNC were [warned by the FBI](https://www.thedailybeast.com/dnc-blew-off-fbi-hack-warnings) about a cyberattack, but ignored it (claiming they thought it was a prank call)... then at some point Podesta got a phishing email... they claimed to have known it was a phishing email, yet told John Podesta to open it:

&gt;When Podesta received a phishing email prompting him to click a button, a Clinton aide mistakenly responded that “This is a legitimate email,” when he meant to type “illegitimate” to warn the campaign chief off the hacker email.

You wouldn't just type "don't open that goddamn email you retarded boomer"? You'd say "this is an illegitimate emai"? Okay. ;)

Podesta then opened this phishing email and the alleged "breach" occured... then they got a private firm (that [later got nailed lying about another hack](https://www.voanews.com/a/cyber-firm-rewrites-part-disputed-russian-hacking-report/3781411.html) they pinned on Russia) to claim Russia hacked them, but they [wouldn't let the FBI actually examine their server](https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/fbi-russia-hacking-dnc-crowdstrike/index.html). Eventually the FBI ended up being provided, via Crowdstrike (the seemingly Russia-hating IT contractors), with a [disk image of the server](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmkxp9/dnc-server-conspiracy-theory-russian-hack-explained) (a good start for an investigation, if not doctored before imaging, but still not as authoritative as getting the actual, physical server given hardware backdoors, etc., exist).

And that's not even getting into the technical details (hack attribution is near impossible, the file creation metadata from the "hacked" files is [inconsistent with a hack](https://www.thenation.com/article/a-new-report-raises-big-questions-about-last-years-dnc-hack/) , the phishing email was sent from a Russian free webmail server but the person who sent it had it [set to an English UI](https://medium.com/@jeffreyscarr/the-yandex-domain-problem-2076089e330b), etc.) or the fact that when the "hack" happened Obama told his cyber defense folks to [stand down](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/obama-cyber-chief-confirms-stand-order-russian-cyberattacks-summer-2016-204935758.html).

When the dust settles and all the details are out in a publicly digestible form it's all going to make quite a story.
But they tell people to vote for the GOP candidates in every single election?!?

They give them fancy names like "Lion Ted". Did I miss something?
He was John McCain.
Can you please inform me what politican is an honest broker?
Awww... isn't that sweet. Some have been calling out the one party system for decades, but thanks for finally joining the chorus.
It looks like you’re focusing too much on party affiliation
Comey is as much a republican as hillary lmao

after exonerating Hillary Clinton for the email saying that she was guilty of and then pushing a false Russia investigation



Call me went on to write an anti Trump book where he made fun of fun of the president's hands and then started giving Democrats political advice



Comey is not a Republican

Miller was comeys apprentice and Obama's FBI director

And Rod Rosenstein was a Hillary voter who was one of the McCain types. People who call themselves Republicans but support Democrat policies and vote for Democrats

There's no evidence that Russia even actually influence the election let alone colluded with Trump to do it

What's the evidence so far? They spent like $2,000 on Facebook ads? You do realize I spent $1000 on my own right?

 And thousands if not millions of trump supporters most likely paid for their own ads as well?

And further investigation found that those supposed Russians ran ads for both sides. It was discovered that they were really just selling off political influence cash rather than trying to influence the election


So what else you got? RT? The spokesman of Russian propaganda Network RT is Lee camp. A clear leftist who is not shy about his hatred of Donald  trump

Let's see what else? So far that's basically all they've got. So what we've got is no evidence that Russia actually had any effect on the election or even attempted to have a major effect.

And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to have an effect. We don't have any evidence that Trump gave anything to them or that they gave anything to Trump

Kind of the opposite of what it would look like?

However that doesn't mean there's no evidence of Russian collusion

we do have evidence of Hillary Clinton and her campaign purchasing Russian propaganda in the form of a phony dossier from both the Russian government and a British spy

We didn't know that the Russian propaganda that Hillary paid Russia for was used to try to influence the election and then to try to undermine the president of the United States. Which should be considered treason anyway.

sorry for all the investigating all we have is like Hillary Clinton clearly colluded with Russia in order to influence the election and then to undermine the US government

before you bring up any Trump Tower meetings literally nothing happened at that meeting. There was nothing wrong with the meeting in the first place. Since Trump jr. Was simply following up on a lead that Hillary Clinton may have done something illegal. But the meeting went nowhere anyway. Trump jr. Gave nothing to the lawyer and the lawyer gave nothing to Trump jr.

and before you bring up any arrests or indictments you'll have to remember that literally no person who ever worked for Trump was indicted for Russian collusion. The closest you have is Paul manafort who lobbied for the Ukraine while working for Democrat Tony podesta long before he ever worked for Trump trump

SO TLDR

no evidence that Russia influenced the election for Trump. No evidence of collusion by Trump. Lots of evidence of collusion by  dems


not to mention the massive collusion between Democrats and major media Outlets
If they support dems theyre honest!

Even tho the dossier was false and hillary was a comwoman!

in reality they put party before country. And the Democrats have been putting party before country for a long time

Unlike u guys who tell everybody to vote for the democrat in every Election


Ted is objectively better than "hit n run" orourke

Desantis is objectively better than "lets ban guns and institute a florida income tax" gillum

DeSantis is so clean that they had to make up some racism accusations out of thin air


Then theres the dem who said dont vote for the asian "ching chong"
While. this is all true it leaves out that GOP has been doing the same thing. They are all just vehicles to power for sociopaths.
These are the same people who believe that Obama was part of a decades-long conspiracy to get him into the White House. That the plan began before his birth and included his birth announcement among other things.
So all the people Trump appointed that now lead the investigation are not actually deep state, or did he appointing deep state operatives?

Tell us.

Are all those GOP members that Trump had picked and supported deep state? Is "Lion Ted" deep state? The_Donald seems to have alot of shifting opinions about this. Trump was fighting against the deep state when he called him "Lying Ted" right? The deep state wanted him to lose the primary? Now he is "Lion ted". How does this deep state thing work actually? Is everybody questioning Trump deep state by default and everybody that supports him becomes a real american? The_Donald explained to people how good "sleepy jeff" is because he is so loyal and was there since the beginning. Now he is deep state or just incompetent?
Wow, you're clueless.
&gt;before you bring up any Trump Tower meetings literally nothing happened at that meeting

It's also amusing that the head of Fusion GPS [had dinner with](https://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/fusion-gps-glenn-simpson-dined-russian-lawyer-after-her-meeting-trump-tower) the infamous "Russian lawyer" the day before and after the Trump Tower meeting.
&gt;It's all a Democrat conspiracy, for sure.

I think you somehow missed the Republican #NeverTrump movement.
One can start with him pretending to be a war hero:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO0mHEJyC3Y
You're in the conspiracy sub, yet don't understand the concept of infiltration. Huh.
Clueless is not realizing that the US is a duopoly in which the two parties collude to advance the deep state's agenda: Hillary Clinton voting for the sham Iraq War, etc.
&gt;Are all those GOP members that Trump had picked and supported deep state

Appointed folks can be compromised (and word on the street is that folks don't wear their deep state loyalty on their sleeves).
It's not about what happened at the meeting -\_- it is literally about this part:

&amp;#x200B;

" He initially told the press that the meeting was held to discuss adoptions of Russian children by Americans. On July 8, 2017, after news reports stated that Trump Jr. knew the meeting was political, he admitted in a tweet that he had agreed to the meeting with the understanding that he would receive information damaging to [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton), and that he was conducting [opposition research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_research).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting#cite_note-Apuzzo-4) When the [*New York Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times) was about to report on email exchanges between Rob Goldstone and Trump Jr., Trump Jr. himself admitted that Rob Goldstone had stated in an email to him that the Russian government was involved and that the purpose of the meeting was to get "dirt on Clinton" and that the meeting concerned a "Russian effort to aid (the Trump) campaign."[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting#cite_note-I_love_it-6) In early July 2017, it was reported that President Donald Trump himself drafted Trump Jr.'s initial misleading statement;[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting#cite_note-7) the report was later confirmed by the president's attorneys.[\[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Tower_meeting#cite_note-8) "

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how you could be a conspiracy theorist if you don't think thats suspicious.
So they were not deep state and got compromised after Trump appointed them? All of them or just some?

Is "Lion Ted" compromised yet or still a true patriot?
so he lied about the purpose of the meeting because he knew that the Democrat media Outlets would spin it out of control and make up stories?


IM SHOCKED

if I were in his position the last thing I would do is give Democrat media Outlets like CNN any ammo for their racist Russia conspiracy theories


what I find hilarious is that they claim it's treason for  d Trump jr. to ATTEMPT to get dirt on Hillary from a Russian lawyer

But isn't that exactly what Hillary did?

What do they say to Hillary and John McCain literally paying Russia for a  dossier that they used to both rig the election and then to try to undermine the president
Why would you not include any recent developments in this?   
Off the top of my head \[this one\]([https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber/u-s-indictments-show-technical-evidence-for-russian-hacking-accusations-idUSKBN1K32X1](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cyber/u-s-indictments-show-technical-evidence-for-russian-hacking-accusations-idUSKBN1K32X1)) is what I can think of would be pretty important and kinda slashes down your whole second to last paragraph? There's a few others that I can think of like the assumption their influence was debatable because in the 37 page indictment it describes something a lot more in depth than simple astro turfing  : [https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download) 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like its just better practice to follow up on this stuff before you make a large post with citations that are comparably outdated to recent news. Citing articles that were over a year old before we had a chunk of the disclosed evidence just distorts the information more.
I really don't get how you instantly give one side the benefit of the doubt while thinking anything the other side does is a conspiracy and evil?

What a damn double standard
Birth Name: John McCain
Goes By: John McCain

Hm.... Sounds like that isn't a con?
&gt;So they were not deep state and got compromised after Trump appointed them?

How would he know if they were compromised? That's kind of how being compromised works... you keep it on the downlow.

&gt;How does this deep state thing work actually?

It's a large faction made up of smaller factions that share strategic goals (with some factions having historic ties to intelligence agencies like the CIA). Some people are lifers/diehards in these factions (the Bushes, Clintons, Bill Kristol, etc.). They tend to be consistent in their promotion of certain ideas. Some people work with, or align themselves with, these factions for personal/political gain then switch sides.
&gt;kinda slashes down your whole second to last paragraph

How so?

&gt;I feel like its just better practice to follow up on this stuff before you make a large post with citations that are comparably outdated to recent news

Recent embellishments, more like. Folks like Binney, who knows a thing or two, are still saying the same thing.
So he put deep state folks into leading government positions because he was unable to see through them? Given that apparently many of his picks are deep state is it possible he is deep state?
&gt;So he put deep state folks into leading government positions because he was unable to see through them?

That seems to be the case. Doesn't seem like picking a guy who talked about secretly taping convos with him, as Rosenstein did, would make much sense otherwise. ;) And, of course, people can get compromised after being appointed.

&gt;Given that apparently many of his picks are deep state is it possible he is deep state?

If he was deep state then there would never have been resistance to him in the first place.
maybe they wanted to make him look like an outsider, now he gets all the deep statelers in...

Makes sense doesn't it?
Wouldn't be necessary given establishment candidates are able to do that normally.
maybe no full deep statlers were available that could win. Since Ted Cruz is now "Lion Ted" so he isn't deep state and Jeb Bush was too weak to beat Clinton. They brought in somebody who could beat Hillary. And then he puts all the deep statlers in power ( like you admit ), now they want to get rid of him and blame the Russia thing on him. He is the fall guy but part of the deep state shown due to him doing deep state stuff, and bringing in more deep state.

Did his fans get fooled?
Look man, Binney did a great thing by disclosing what he knew, but that does not grant him automatic knowledge over the case, or the evidence that wasn't publicly available, if you'd actually look at the indictments you'd see the things they've been charged with are far more wide ranging than Facebook trolls and tweets. 

It slashes down your point because there is provable technical evidence now that this hack was conducted by Russian operatives I just don't get why that's being ignored I guess. what evidence is there that this was conducted by someone else? I mean its a lot more than just they had an IP address if you actually read the 37 page indictment.
Which current senators are on that train?
&gt;It slashes down your point because there is provable technical evidence

...But nothing specific you know of that you see fit to mention that related to the publicly available facts I've mentioned relating to the DNC "hack".

&gt;what evidence is there that this was conducted by someone else ... I mean its a lot more than just they had an IP address

All the publicly disclosed facts I listed (plus the fact that the organization that released the Podesta emails claims they were garnered via a leak rather than a hack). I never mentioned an IP address (IP addresses are usually irrelevant given hackers use proxies).

Summary:
So they were not deep state and got compromised after Trump appointed them?
How does this deep state thing work actually?
And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to have an effect.
&gt;So they were not deep state and got compromised after Trump appointed them?
It's all a Democrat conspiracy, for sure.
So all the people Trump appointed that now lead the investigation are not actually deep state, or did he appointing deep state operatives?

No evidence of collusion by Trump.
&gt;How does this deep state thing work actually?

When was it announced that the Trump campaign was under investigation?
