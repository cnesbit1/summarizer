Original Response:
I was hoping he’d say he’s proud to be a virgin or something. Make him more relatable to the r/mma crowd
Hey hey, get out with your old cliches. We all lost our virginity way back when we saw what happened in the aftermath of Romero-Rockhold.
*It’s pretty funny, cause I’m technically not. I mean, let’s be honest; it’s been awhile. But this one summer when I was about 15, I was in karate class holding boards for kicking drills. We had some belt exams coming up. This one new guy musta thought he was Bruce Lee or something and full-blast roundhouse kicked, but completely missed the boards and got both of my arms as they were stiff and braced. It broke both of them. Pretty bad. I was in casts for two months. Everything was a pain in the ass. Eating, drinking, sleeping positions. However, my mom was a very compassionate, forward-thinking woman and willing to think outside the box. Anyways, one day she walks on into my room at the most.. inconvenient time...*
Dear God not this lol
Lol where this is from
That day, my mom really let her hands go and got the finish.

After you're done reading that, remember: be careful what you wish for.
I mean, if we're being honest, Stephen Thompson is a 36 year old man who is not married and I've never seen any footage of him with a girl. No instagram post, no nothing. You'd think there would be *some* mention of him with a female at this point.

He's also a devout christian that might have something to do with it.
Well I've seen people mention that he has a fiancee. But unless you're from South Carolina and run in to him there's no way to confirm it. Maybe he's just wants to keep his personal life private.
ahhahahha keep dreaming.
Thanks dick. I just blew an entire afternoon reading this in complete shock lol
I thought he was married to Weidman's sister ? Do I have that backward ?
Now look in reddit threads all over the site that mention “broken arms” and “mother” they’re everywhere and they’re in the most random threads.
Well hopefully he's the nice kind and not the child molesting kind.
His brother is married to Weidman's sister.
That was kind of a strange comment to make.
A whole subreddit lost its innocence right there and then.
You're thinking of catholics

It's alright, the downvotes will hide it. Just like the church.
First of all, how dare you...
