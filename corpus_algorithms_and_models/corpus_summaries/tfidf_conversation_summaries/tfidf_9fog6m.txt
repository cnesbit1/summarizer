Hello, I'm looking for NA Gamestop Poipole codes distributed at gamestop from Sep. 17th. I can provide Yokohama Pikachu for codes.

If interested, please reply to me.

Of course, I've never used cloning, Save Managers and any glitches.

NOTE:

(1) Please don't send me any hacked, cloned or uncertain Pokemons such as 6IVs wild pokemon in Master ball even if it's for matching numbers.

(2) I live in GMT+9 and be available at 7am to 8am, 12am to 1pm, 6pm to 7pm and 9pm to 12pm my time in general.

***Services : Costs***

* 1-nature custom redemption of Yokohama Pikachu : 8 Poipole codes
* same above : 5XY + 8KG codes

This trade is not rush but I would like to get some codes until 3 days later from distribution date.

Hello! Is it possible to reserve a Pikachu for 8 Poipole codes? That is, if you aren't in rush of getting the codes :)
Hello, thanks for the comment :)

This trade is not rush but that depends on the date you'll probably get codes. It's ok to take 1 week.
Thank you! In that case, is it possible to trade 16 shiny Poipole codes for 2 Pikachus?
I'm sorry, 8 codes are enough for me because the poipole's nature is fixed to Modest I guess.
Okay. Thank you :) I will reserve 8 codes for you then
Thanks as well :)
Also, please let me know which nature you want.
I'd like Timid :)
OK, I'll send proofs via PM when I finish. See you next weekend :)
