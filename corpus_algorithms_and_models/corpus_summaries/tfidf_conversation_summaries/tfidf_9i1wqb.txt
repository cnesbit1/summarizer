Yes, he can, but this sub is not the best place to ask, as you will encouraged to embrace homosexuality by many people.

Head over to /r/exhomosexual and /r/ssachristian, for a more surportive crowd
Sorry but you cant change sexuality. Thats common knowledge.
Again, there are people both psychologists and ex homosexuals that would disagree with you.
There is also scientist that have testified to 9/11 being a inside job. Does not make em right.
Lots of people have changed, though.

Some people have decided to do studies about the weirdest "conversion therapies" involving aversion therapy, electric shocks etc to "prove" that sexuality can't change. That doesn't demonstrate anything other than those particular therapies didn't work.
Please ignore this advice from this poster.  Stay away from those forums.   It's dangerous and flat out wrong.
No there aren't.  They're frauds.
No they haven't.  None of those dangerous methods have ever successfully changed one's orientation.  You are absolutely wrong.  People who claim they changed are almost always right-wing religious fanatics who are suppressing their feelings to try and convince themselves they changed.  They usually end up getting caught in same-sex relationships down the road.
At least I am trying to help the OP
Of course you can :)  I know multiple people who no longer have urges, and have dealt with the issues that caused them in the first place.  Others who still have temptations, but restrain them, just like a straight person who's single would.  The media of course won't ever say that, it's political suicide.
Right...

All of them...
Yes, they have. That said, I don't agree with methods and therapies- God does it, not these things.

That said, what evidence do you have that the thousands of ex gay people telling their stories are all "right wing religious fanatics who are suppressing their feelings"?

Ex gay people saying God has changed them IS evidence. You don't get to hand wave them all away just because it disagrees with your worldview.
Yes, all of them.
No you're not, you're advocating methods that are proven to harm people and are being banned by States.  They're evil, as are the people who support using them like Mike Pence.
Well, the largest organization for "Ex-gays" admitted that none of their members ever changed their orientation, and their former Founder is now in a same-sex relationship.

They admitted it was a scam.  There is no documented evidence that anyone has changed their orientation. 

There are countless examples of people who have prayed for years and years for God to change them and he never does.

So if you were correct, you'd have to ask why he changes a few people, but refuses to change most people.
Right....
Which states have banned prayer, counseling, and encouragement?
That one thing being a scam does not mean that everyone is.

As for people praying for years - God is a person, not a force or an automatic process. Some people he delivers instantly, but others he may do so later, and some maybe not at all - this doesn't mean that God doesn't love them, or that they "prayed wrong". Some of the obstacles we face are meant to be learning experiences for us. One story I heard about an ex gay man, he asked God if being gay was truly wrong, and he didn't get an answer for 2 years! For myself, God has delivered me from a few things- from an unwanted desire and from eczema. But other things, he may deliver me from later, if at all, in his time and for his purposes.
Why is that hard to believe? People scared of going to hell will convince themselves of being 'ex'-gay.

Proof? And I'm not talking about testimonies, I want hard proof. I want to see the studies done showing that someone was able to change who they are attracted too. I want to see a brain scan of an "ex homosexual" showing that they are indeed attracted to the opposite sex. Until then I nor your or anybody else should Beleive in things without evidence.
I have yet to see quantitative proof that these peoples sexual orientation has changed, and I’ve been looking for it for around 10 years. Yet I’ve heard of dozens of cases of prominent “exgays” being found lurking for cock on Grindr. 

You cannot change sexual orientation.
[deleted]
So no scientific tests to show whether or not these people are still privy to same sex attraction....

Why did you post this if it didn’t even pertain to my comment?
[deleted]
There’s a fine line between this and what many Christians decide to do which is ostracisation, condemnation, conversion therapy and other extreme methods. Think the dude though u were defending conversion therapy.
Supposed bias is not an excuse for lack of evidence. You have literally zero data to support the claim that sexual orientation is capable of being changed at will.
You will most likely end up hurting him. Statistically.
The truth sets people free
Or kills them?
My view is that people who tell those who have same sex attraction that they **have to** accept it and **have to** embrace it, and deny them help to change; those people are responsible for the suicide rates in young people, and their blood is on their hands.
The only gay people I know who have been suicidal have been suicidal while being in conversion therapy environments, or who were raised to believe that being gay *was* a choice. So they blamed themselves and hated themselves for continuing to be gay. If prayer, counseling, fasting, exorcisms, etc didn't work, the fault must be theirs, right? 

It was precisely the opposite of what you are describing.

I have no words for how blind you seem to most gay folks' reality.
&gt;I have no words for how blind you seem to most gay folks' reality.

And in this world, it is not possible to be a follower of Jesus and support sin.
Again, you are willfully ignoring what I said about my loved ones' experiences with suicidal ideation.
&gt;Again, you are willfully ignoring what I said about my loved ones' experiences with suicidal ideation.

Again, sin has consequences.

As christians we are supposed to love, encourage and help people overcome their sin, not enable them to embrace it.

If that is too hard for you to do, perhaps following Christ isn't for you?
&gt; Again, sin has consequences.

These are Christians who were not acting on their sexual orientation and were in constant prayer, counseling, fasting, and other spiritual practices to change their sexual orientation. Because they believed their churches that God could and would change their orientation.

Tell me: what was their sin?

And if there was no sin, why were they suicidal?

&gt; If that is too hard for you to do, perhaps following Christ isn't for you?

Following Christ takes sacrifices -- sacrifices I have made. You do not know anyone's relationship with Christ, and I'd caution you against sweeping generalizations, as you risk blasphemy against the Spirit. None of us can be certain of God's activity. Those who were most certain in Jesus's day were the most wrong.

But Scripture promises that his commandments are not burdensome. Do you know whose are? Matthew 23:4.
&gt;Tell me: what was their sin?

Listening to the devil.

I've been there, I have had to deal with suicidal thoughts, and God saved me from committing suicide.

&gt;&gt; If that is too hard for you to do, perhaps following Christ isn't for you?
&gt;
&gt;Following Christ takes sacrifices -- sacrifices I have made. 

Yet, it would appear you can't  quite sacrafice the idea that homosexuality and thought and deed isn't sinful, and align your views with what scripture is clear on.

&gt; I'd caution you against sweeping generalizations, 

By their fruits you shall know them.
&gt; Listening to the devil.

On which point?

Because they were listening to the church. The churches that agree with you. And they weren't getting what you promise. Which suggests the promises were lies.
&gt; Yet, it would appear you can't quite sacrafice the idea that homosexuality and thought and deed isn't sinful, and align your views with what scripture is clear on.

I lived that for decades. It bore no good fruit. My decision to accept the orientation God had given me was guided by the Spirit and has yielded much good fruit in mine and others' lives.

&gt; By their fruits you shall know them.

Like causing little girls and boys to want to kill themselves?
&gt;I lived that for decades. It bore no good fruit. My decision to accept the orientation God had given me was guided by the Spirit and has yielded much good fruit in mine and others' lives.

Ah, that explains so much.
It certainly explains why I'm certain you are wrong, yes.
I am absolute in my beleif that homosexuality in both thought and deed is against God wills for a person's life, and that those who remain willfull and unrepeantant in their sin, will be rejected by Jesus.

I will continue to preach this until the day I die, because it is the truth that is revealed by a plain and simple reading of the inspired scriptures.
I am absolute in my belief that the message you preach is contributing to the death of God's children.

I am resolute in this because I have seen it with my own eyes.

I am also absolute in my belief that you avoid evidence that contradicts your sweeping generalizations about gay Christians. I have never seen you engage with any of our testimonies with charity or humility. I have many conservative and traditional friends who can do this. You are wholly incapable.

Your God and your gospel are too small.
&gt;I am absolute in my belief that the message you preach is contributing to the death of God's children.

Sin has consequences.
Pity yours has to have such dire consequences for others.
Dude, I am not sinning when I preach what the bible clearly says
You think I'm an enemy of the cross and I think you have made yourself a willing enemy of God's children.

Don't call me dude.
&gt;You think I'm an enemy of the cross and I think you have made yourself a willing enemy of God's children.

I guess only time will tell.
It already has. Faithful believers are dying for the sake of your "good" news.
&gt;Faithful believers are dying for the sake of your "good" news.

Again, preaching a lie doesn't help anyone. My prayer is that one day you will see this.
You believe women can serve in ministry. You are well acquainted with holding to a belief that you don't think is in conflict with Scripture and which many, many, many would say is obviously in conflict with a "plain reading" of Scripture.

One would think this would make you empathetic to others who do the same but with other doctrines.

But no, everything that isn't your reading of Scripture is a lie. And anyone who disagrees with you deserves not your ears of humility but your prayers of pity.
&gt;You believe women can serve in ministry. You are well acquainted with holding to a belief that you don't think is in conflict with Scripture and which many, many, many would say is obviously in conflict with a "plain reading" of Scripture.

But it isn't in conflict with plain reading..there were.women in ministry in new testament church.


&gt;But no, everything that isn't your reading of Scripture is a lie. And anyone who disagrees with you deserves not your ears of humility but your prayers of pity.

Nevertheless, it is my prayer that you turn from your sin and repent.
&gt; Nevertheless, it is my prayer that you turn from your sin and repent.

And others pray that you turn for your sin of misreading Scripture and telling women they can overstep the bounds God has set for them.

How do you feel about their prayers of pity and their calls for you to repent from your erroneous and liberal reading of Scripture?
&gt;How do you feel about their prayers of pity and their calls for you to repent from your erroneous and liberal reading of Scripture?

If you believe that I am wrong, your prayer should be that my heart softens and I hear the "truth" as you know it. 

I engage in conversation with God every night, and study the scriptures several times a week, so I firmly believe that if my interpretation is incorrect, God will reveal this to me, via the holy spirit.

I have corrected my views on "once saved always saved", maybe I am wrong about homosexuality, I am open to that possibility.

However as yet, my studying an meditation on the word of God has not revealed that to me.
&gt; I have corrected my views on "once saved always saved", maybe I am wrong about homosexuality, I am open to that possibility.

You say that, but you aren't. In this very conversation, you have called any alternative to your particular reading a "lie." You can't even use the word truth with regards to my view without putting it in scare quotes.

If you believed that you are possibly wrong, you wouldn't be so quick to spout your opposition to alternative readings of Scripture on this question. Either admit your certainty, or act more humbly. To do what you habitually do and claim that you are open to being wrong is plainly hypocritical lip-service.

&gt; If you believe that I am wrong, your prayer should be that my heart softens and I hear the "truth" as you know it.

I actually think God is more successful by breaking hearts rather than softening them. I've found that to be the case in my life and in others. Especially those of us who are so sure of ourselves. To some, God whispers. To others he knocks them off their horse and blinds them for a spell.

"God breaks the heart again, and again, and again, until it stays open."

I pray God breaks your heart as he has broken mine.
&gt;I pray God breaks your heart as he has broken mine.

Awesome, take care
&gt; Awesome, take care

No need to be passive aggressive.
I wasn't being
This is a pattern you have. So long as you feel you have the clear upperhand, you press the point and ask why they won't relent to a "plain reading" of Scripture.

When people make good points, or challenge your Scripture references with other Scripture references, or point out big holes in your argument, you "Awesome, take care" and peace out.

I've seen you do it dozens of times, sometimes with me and sometimes with others.
&gt;When people make good points, or challenge your Scripture references with other Scripture references, or point out big holes in your argument, you "Awesome, take care" and peace out.

Go back and read the comment I replied to.
Yeah, I said you were being plainly hypocritical and explained why. You ignored that argument -- as you nearly always do with arguments you don't want to engage with -- quoted my last line and said, "Awesome, take care."
Offer a better argument and I may reply.

However, in this case you offered your prayers for me, to which I replied..

"Awesome, thanks"

Any other response is you reading something that simply isnt there.
&gt; Offer a better argument and I may reply.

What's weak about my current argument about your alleged hypocrisy?

&gt; Any other response is you reading something that simply isnt there.

That's exactly how passive aggression works -- it avoids the substance of the conflict, pretends to be nice, and shuts down.

Again, this isn't about one instance -- it's a conclusion based on your proven pattern of behavior.
There are countless Conservative think tanks around the world with endless money who would love to sponsor studies that prove homosexuality can be changed or is not natural or biological and so on.

The truth is they don’t do that because they know it will fail.

Summary:
And if there was no sin, why were they suicidal?
Tell me: what was their sin?
&gt; Again, sin has consequences.
Ex gay people saying God has changed them IS evidence.
I pray God breaks your heart as he has broken mine.
