Original Response:
Hey there everyone! /u/AnxietyAttack2013 here again! How‚Äôs it going for you all today? I‚Äôm alright personally. Today, we‚Äôve got /u/Anthony_Vapes back! You asked for it and listened. Today‚Äôs interview is a little more casual. Our last sit down you got to see the reviewer behind the reviews. Today we get to know the person behind the reviewer. So kick back as Anthony_Vapes and I talk about Video games, Hot Sauce, and our shared dislike of sushi! 

Disclaimer: this has been copy/pasted directly from my conversation with Anthony. It has been edited for clarity and formatting as well as to make things flow better. Aside from that, nothing has been changed. 

_______________________________________________________

**AnxietyAttack2013**: So what kinda hobbies and interests do you have aside from vaping?

**Anthony_Vapes**: well i'm pretty old and boring lol bu i do like to play video games and golf when i get the chance. I also enjoyed coaching little league which i've done for my kids team for the past few years but taking a break from it for now as he's kinda over playing baseball lol. also watching football (go jets) which is basically my religion as sunday is the holy day of football in my house during the season and playing fantasy football as well

**AA2013**: Golf is wicked fun my dude :) I‚Äôm not good myself but I play haha

**A_V**: i'm not very good either but you basically go to have fun with friends, drive a gold cart, vape and have a few beers, and play for those couple of good shots that make you feel better about all the bad ones lol

**AA2013**: Haha yeah, that‚Äôs pretty much how I look at playing golf myself lol What kinda video games are you into usually?

**A_V**: for games pretty much online co-op is my favorite. i like some PvP. sadly back to destiny 2 these days with the new DLC but waiting for fallout76 and anthem and crackdown for sure. and halo. i'm a big halo fan and gears of war fan

**AA2013**: Anthem looks beautiful!! I‚Äôm not much of a gamer but it‚Äôs really trying to pull me in haha

**A_V**: yes it does! i love BW and the ME series but ME:A was sadly a failure in both the co-op and story. typical rush job by EA i've been a BW fan since the jade empire and Kotor Days

**AA2013**: Knights of the old republic?

**A_V**: yup I tried it again recently and it did not age well though lol

**AA2013**: Classic game! But I‚Äôm biased as a Star Wars fan lol

**A_V**: lol funny enough never got into star wars, hell i've never even seen 1 of them i know i'm a loser lol

**AA2013**: Wow man bold statement haha

**A_V: i'm sure people will be like how have you never seen a star wars movie

**AA2013**: Just never had much interest I guess?

**A_V**: nope. not sure why, just never did and at this point feels like i missed the boat. not much time to watch movies or TV these days anyway lol

**AA2013**: To be honest I haven‚Äôt seen the newest two yet myself haha

**A_V**: i heard they were awful anyway lol

**AA2013**: Possibly lol but I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt see them eventually lol

**A_V**: yeah when your that invested you kinda have to. 

**AA2013**: Is there much out there that you follow for movies, TV, or webseries?

**A_V**: mostly just football. i still watch the walking dead and big bang theory. that's probably it. and judge judy lol yeah i'm old and boring but i love her. she's awesome. good to watch when building attys. everything for me is a multitask. and the marvel netflix stuff is mostly good

**AA2013**: BBT gets a lot of flack but I actually enjoy it myself! 

**A_V**: yeah it's not as good as it was but still not bad, but again final season i'm invested already so kinda have to watch it

**AA2013**: You check out young Sheldon at all?

**A_V**: i seen a couple episodes. didn't care for it. not as bad as other spin offs like joey though LMAO

**AA2013**: Man I tried forgetting about that lmao

**A_V**: lol never forget

**AA2013**: I liked what they did with the characters on young Sheldon though. They‚Äôre well cast I think

**A_V**: yeah i get that. haven't seen enough to say one way or the other but i think it just doens't work quite as well as BBT becuase the supporting cast on that show makes it not sheldon alone. i mean the main charcater when it started was actually leonard but it kinda shifted becuase sheldon was the popular one

**AA2013** So as I‚Äôm making dinner, I gotta ask, what‚Äôs your favorite food lol

**A_V**: lol everything. I lvoe spicy food, not big on seafood but not super picky either. I love steak and mexican food, thai food, itilain food yeah pretty much anything

**AA2013**: Spicy is the best lol I recently got back into chasing hot peppers myself haha

**A_V**: yeah i love spicy food. and trying different hot sauces

**AA2013**: Same in my end! Any good hot sauces you found?

.....ON MY END lol

**A_V**: ok role reveral, whats the best hot sauce you ever had LMAO

dammit you beat my reversal LMAO

**AA2013**: lmao 

**A_V**: i really like the ghost scream garlic chili jam. it's not super hot, it's a bit sweet and garlicly with a little kick but works well with anything. I also had some acai berry one from firehouse subs options rated as a 10 that was dam good. I also have some XXX ghost pepper one i got form hawaii that's pretty legit. IDK i've been through so many it's hard to remember

**AA2013**: I don‚Äôt remember the name of it off the top of my head but mine was a habanero sort of mango one. It was real good and I haven‚Äôt had it since but it had enough heat to be fun but was easy going enough to use as a go to sauce. I wish I could find it again lol A√ßa√≠ berry hot sauce sounds real different though. I could def imagine it being tasty lol

**A_V**: Lol I've had a habanero mango one before. Cant remember the brand but it was good. 

**AA2013**: It‚Äôs a combo I never imagined working well together but man it just works lol Is there particular ingredient or thing in a food that you just can‚Äôt stand?

**A_V**: Not really. Just nothing weird I guess. Not a seafood fan really. Just a few things. Dont care for sushi. I hate avacado lol

**AA2013**: Lol I‚Äôm there with you on sushi! Funny enough I literally just made guacamole lol. 

**[Interviewers note: the guacamole was delicious.]**

**A_V**: Lol gross Its like cold snot in a burrito There is only one sushi I'll eat and only from 1 place that makes it good

**AA2013**: Is it the sushi with avocado in it? Because I recall that being a thing lol

**A_V**: Alot of them have avacado. I'll eat a crunchy roll which is basically just fried tempura shrimp and rice with some sauce on it

**AA2013**: Gotcha lol yeah sushi just isn‚Äôt my thing either though. Even without the fish or seafood. I just can‚Äôt get into it. I think it‚Äôs the type of rice that‚Äôs used

**A_V**: I love rice just not the other stuff in sushi lol Its like weird combinations of stuff that dont belong together

**AA2013**: Lol yeah I gotcha there

**A_V**: Like imagine an ejuice that was dog farts and fish with rice and seaweed flavor

**AA2013**: I‚Äôd honestly rather not lol I‚Äôd never get that taste out of the atty! 

**A_V**: LMAO yeah that flavor would linger more then a menthol anise blend

**AA2013**: Mentholated pluid!!! lol my tank says no but my heart says yes! So you get into any good bands recently?

**A_V**: this ties in with me being old and boring but i basically mostly listen to 90s hip hop and R&amp;B and i'm not big on music these days. just listen while i'm driving lol

**AA2013**: 90s hip hop is great! I‚Äôm partial to The Coup myself :) 

**A_V**: i listen to the throwback stations lol

**AA2013**: Any singers or artists you‚Äôre really diggin recently?

**A_V**: sadly nope. i kinda feel music went to shit and the kids can get off my lawn. lol i hate modern day rap it isn't rap. it's mubling the same thing over for 5 mins

**AA2013**: Yeah I kinda feel you on that. I like some newer rappers like lil peep, ghost mane, and Wicca phase springs eternal, but I‚Äôm not into it as a whole either.

**A_V**: those all sound like noises not people to me LMAO

**AA2013**: Lol you‚Äôre kinda right! I just realized I didn‚Äôt have a natural way to end this so I guess my last question is what‚Äôs for dinner tonight?

**A_V**: whatever my wife is cooking LMAO no idea, your guess is as good as mine

**AA2013**: That‚Äôs fair lol Well my dude, that‚Äôs what I got :)

**A_V**: sounds good bud! pleasure talking to you as always also one more thing to say before you go and it's important

**AA2013**: What‚Äôs up?

I love this my dude, keep it up!  On a side note... what's the worst hotsauce you or u/uAnthony_Vapes have tried?  

I am so down for a review of old gear!  That sounds like a blast!

&amp;#x200B;

And @ Anthony....no avocado?!  wtf dude.....that makes my taste buds cry, I could literally eat avocado every single day and never get sick of it!  I had such high hopes for our budding relationship but alas you have broken my heart, idk if I can recover...LMFAO  

&amp;#x200B;

On the real though #teampositivity
Can‚Äôt remember the name of it (seeing a pattern in my life lol) but it tasted like straight piss. and it wasn‚Äôt even really hot. I saw what it was trying to do but it had way too much vinegar and very little flavor. Just slightly spicy piss. And I‚Äôm bummed that I can‚Äôt remember the name as I want to avoid having it again lol 

The first ep is in the planning stages at the moment :) 

Avocados are the bomb, I agree. I think this is the one thing Anthony and I actually really disagree on lol well that and star wars but not a disagreement when you haven‚Äôt seen it yet lol. 

\#teampositivity my dude &lt;3
IDK it's hard to make a bad hot sauce LMAO. i guess i don't like the ones with all kick and no flavor but can't really remember any off the top of my head

and yeah no avacado for me lol. it ruins a burrito IMO. a burrito is a delicious blend of marinated meat, cheese, potato, sour cream, sauces all wrapped up in a warm tortilla , no reason to add a cold snot like concoction into it LMAO
I need to start putting potatoes in my burritos I think lol
Oh dude, that sounds vile :-X
I've had a few like that too, I got one of those lame hotsauce gift boxes from walmart one year from a family member and that about summed it up, just vinegar and nastiness with varying degrees of hotness.

I can give a pass on the star wars thing too, but no avocados, and no sushi? ugh, such a disappointment LMAO
Ok wait....no avocado, but you'll add potato?  I mean, in a breakfast burrito sure, but not a regular one, and sour cream is more or less cold snot too, so i mean...   ;-D
I actually found a few decent sauces from those gift boxes lol. The mango habanero I was talking about as my go to actually came from it. Nothing I‚Äôd hunt down but a very solid sauce that I can actually always enjoy. 

I too am saddened by his lack of avocado love lmao
hell yeah! california burrito. pico, carne asada, cheese, and french fries. then i add sour cream. they are love, they are life! although if you want a really good one hard to find get an adobada burrito. those are amazing if they make the adobada good or a tocino burrito. yeah i'm kinda really into burritos LMAO
california burrito comes with potato :) you should know this lol they sell those everywhere in cali
Just made some burritos last night actually! I‚Äôm there with you on them, they‚Äôre so good!!
# #teamburrito #teampositivity!
I am SoCal born and raised and I hoenstly have never hear of it called a California Burrito, weird... But I'm more of a Garbage Burrito Guy myself, especially from the OG ghetto walk-ups.  There's one in my town that's been around since the 50's and is still family owned. Everything cooked in lard as it should be, they make their own chips, amazing chili colorado, carne asada and chili verde. Even home made tamales. Everything comes on paper plates wrapped in foil.  The place is legit!
Lmao my man I can‚Äôt agree more!!!
:)
your from California and never had a California burrito? every taco shop has one LMAO all make it slightly different though but the main stuff is potatoes or fries, carne asada, guac and cheese. some add pico as well. of course i get mine with no guac though :)
I mean, I know potatoes in a burrito is a thing, I've just never heard them called a California burrito. Now I feel like I'm in some twilight zone shit... O_o .... so I asked my wife too and she had no idea what I was talking about.  I googled it and it's a San Diego thing so that makes so much more sense.  I rarely head that far south.
ah lol that makes sense then. I never get mexican food in LA because it's so abundant down here anyway i'd rather eat something I can't get down here lol didn't realize it was a SD thing only. well the more you know i guess :) i learned something new today
You and me both!
life is a constant learning process :)
I would argue for avocado in some tortas tbh--mostly with chorizo. I do think they're really overrated and usually don't contribute much though.

And I agree that putting guac in burritos a great way to fuck up the texture. Everything that's giving guac flavor is already in a burrito anyway. I'm not sure what the logic is.
ah man i love a good torta but still no avacado LMAO. torta cubana is the best!

and LMAO yeah i don't get the guac in burrito thing at all like i get it as a dip even though i don't like it but in a burrito? no idea
Maybe it's me, but committing to an extended face full of chorizo really brings out how tangy it can be. So for me some avocado helps the acid a little and lets me taste the rest of it. Personal thing I guess haha. 

I would *not* use it with the acid in like an al pastor though. I'd recommend regular therapy sessions for anyone pairing that with avocado lol.
lol that makes sense. i usually only get chorizo in a breakfast burrito.
I actually went out and got a torta just now lolol
cubana? u gotta get the cubana
Al pastor :-\ Cubana next time tho that shit's amazing haha. And by next time I probably mean dinner at this rate...
al pastor is good but cubana is bae LMAO
Come on now I'm still full man...
nobody eats because they are hungry, they eat because it's there and good LMAO
Man talking to you about food is a lot like reading your reviews.  "Man, this deck's just like an atty I love, but it has an 'air conditioner style airflow' and I'm pretty sure I see hex screws in the blurry accessory shot.  *Better buy that shit quick!*"

But have I ever regretted it?

sigh...

*grabs keys*
LMAO off to the taco shop u go!
&gt;IDK it's hard to make a bad hot sauce LMAO

I disproved this at my first attempt making hot sauce, lol.

Also, freshly made guac with a thicker consistency is good, I'm with you on that goopy stuff, though.

Local taco place here also makes an avocado, cilantro, lime, and jalapeno salsa that is fucking phenomenal
i just don't like avacado flavor at all but cilantro, lime, and jalapeno is all excellent
I enjoyed this much more than the 1st =]

You and u/Anthony_Vapes , need to check out Marie Sharp's Belizean Heat! I've converted non-hotsauce fans into believers with this stuff!
Dam I'll need to try that. Lots of hot sauce lovers here I guess
Def. got to give it a try on some eggs and whatnot for breakfast
I love hot sauce on eggs and hash browns but sadly most restaurants only have tobasco lmao
Thank you!! I had a blast doing it with him too lol 

And I‚Äôll def be looking for that! Thank you lol
Hey nothing wrong with good ol' tabasco sauce to spice things up =]
Cheers!
I mean its decent but not very hot or very good. It's better then nothing pretty much lol
Agreed. Though since moving to NC all I see is texas pete in most restaurants. I miss the tabasco standard up north =/
never even heard of that brand lol
It's a carolina thing. Very watery, ok flavor, and not spicy or hot at all
sounds not good at all LMAO
It isn't and it EVERYWHERE! Even in fast food too =/
LMAO that sucks

Summary:
I just can‚Äôt get into it.
yeah i'm kinda really into burritos LMAO.
sounds not good at all LMAO.
Personal thing I guess haha.
your from California and never had a California burrito?
Lmao my man I can‚Äôt agree more!!
I mean its decent but not very hot or very good.
They‚Äôre well cast I think

**A_V**: yeah i get that.
And I hope you enjoy your day!
IDK it's hard to make a bad hot sauce LMAO.
It's better then nothing pretty much lol.
I‚Äôm there with you on them, they‚Äôre so good!
:) you too my dude

**A_V**: :) now go enjoy your dinner lol

**AA2013**: Lol I am :) thank you!
I hate avacado lol

**AA2013**: Lol I‚Äôm there with you on sushi!
Just nothing weird I guess.
Lots of hot sauce lovers here I guess.
**A_V**: those all sound like noises not people to me LMAO

**AA2013**: Lol you‚Äôre kinda right!
ah lol that makes sense then.
ah man i love a good torta but still no avacado LMAO.
I am so down for a review of old gear!
I love this my dude, keep it up!
I had a blast doing it with him too lol 

And I‚Äôll def be looking for that!
**A_V**: yup I tried it again recently and it did not age well though lol

**AA2013**: Classic game!
