Original Response:
Demonising Russia is dangerous says article from Russian propoganda ministry.

Remember when Russia invaded Georgia? They embarrassed themselves because their army was so out dated. The USA just torched about 200 Russians in the desert in Syria. Russia is not a military threat beyond MAD.

With all due respect to the Nobel Farce Prize, this lady can suck my dick.
&gt; Russia is not a military threat beyond MAD.

In other words you agree - demonising Russia is dangerous.
No I don't agree.

Russia cannot be allowed to continue to flaunt international norms, invading countries and fomenting dissent in Eastern Europe. They cannot be allowed to normalise chemical weapons use. They cannot be allowed to continue along the path Putin has chosen.

Calling out Russian aggression is not demonising them, it's calling them to account. If they don't want to play nicely they don't get to play with the toys ( trade, movement of people etc). 

I have no problem with Russian people, they are held under Putin's boot like many other people in totalitarian dictatorships and it is but a matter of time before the Russian people say enough is enough.
Your two-dimensional world view is absurd. The US flouts international norms to a far greater extent than Russia, and the US has been directly responsible for heightened tension in Eastern Europe, in direct contravention to the [Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances). The annexation of Crimea was in direct response to western-backed coup in Kiev, backed by the US.

There was a popular uprising in Ukraine. The Russians tried to kill Yushchenko and got a bit of a scared when they saw Ukraine slipping west.

That's when the plan to annex Crimea was taken off the shelf, in violation of the Budapest agreement funnily enough!
&gt;Remember when Russia invaded Georgia?

No, because that is  misinformation peddled by the Atlantic Council.  An independent European commission was clear in its findings:

&gt;Open  hostilities  began  with  a  large-scale  Georgian  military  operation  against  the  town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008. 
Operations  started  with  a  massive  Georgian  artillery  attack.  At  the  very  outset  of  the    operation  the  Commander  of  the  Georgian  contingent  to  the  Joint  Peacekeeping  Forces  (JPKF),  Brigadier  General  Mamuka  Kurashvili,  stated  that  the  operation  was  aimed  at    restoring  the  constitutional  order  in  the  territory  of  South  Ossetia.  Somewhat  later  the  Georgian  side  refuted  Mamuka  Kurashvili’s  statement  as  unauthorised  and  invoked  the  countering  of  an  alleged  Russian  invasion  as  justification  of  the  operation (pg 19).

&gt; Russia is not a military threat beyond MAD

One of the most insane sentences ever written down.  Folks, not a threat, just a potential end of the world.
&gt;Russia cannot be allowed to continue to flaunt international norms,

Like what?  Overthrow democratically elected governments in Latin America and the Middle East?   Openly ignore the rulings of the International Criminal Court and pretend like it never happened?  Utilize Nato to overthrow countries?   

The international norms you refer to is just a matrix of alliances and directives crated to maintain an empire and protect the US hegemony.   Contra your neocon view, a multipolar view is a preferable option to a unipolar view.
&gt;There was a popular uprising in Ukraine.

There was a coup in Ukraine.  Nuland was busted on a phone call planning a post coup government before the protests even started.

&gt; *"They embarrassed themselves because their army was so out dated."*

'Member when the US invaded Afghanistan hunting for the Dialysis Cave Man and his band of Terrorists in Turbans and their Goat-Herding Guerilla Gangster friends?

That was 17 years ago, and we're still there... 'Member?

I 'member.
If you believe the Afghan war was about Bin Laden I don't think we're going to have a productive conversation.
Wait, are you saying that Russia would actually start a nuclear war if we say nasty things about them?

Does that sound peaceful?
&gt; *"They cannot be allowed to normalise chemical weapons use."*

What are you referring to? 

Has Russia even been *accused* of using chemical weapons in the battlefield in Syria or elsewhere? If so, when?

Maybe you're referring to the *alleged assassination attempt* (via poisoning) in Britain? Even if those far-fetched accusation were true, an *assassination attempt* hardly constitutes "chemical weapons" use as conventionally defined.

As to invading and meddling in the affairs of other countries, did Russia invade Iraq or Libya under false pretenses? Did Russia foment the "Arab Spring" that instigated the slaughter in Yemen and Syria? Or support the Military Coup to oust Morsi in Egypt, replacing him with the Western puppet al Sisi?

Do you have John Bolton on speed-dial, perchance?
That was the official "justification".

I'd love to hear your version, though.
Thank you. This sub becomes more and more like /r/the_vlad.

There ain’t no conspiracy here; only an argument whether Russia is a force for good or a force for evil, and surprisingly you get a different answer on who you ask!
The official justification was Al Qaeda blatantly running terrorist training camps out in the open and the Taliban, acting as the official Afghan government, refusing an ultimatum to shut them down and expel Al Qaeda. This shit is not exactly hard to figure out. It is the [third sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan) in the wiki article on the invasion.

&gt;U.S. President George W. Bush demanded that the Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and expel al-Qaeda; bin Laden had already been wanted by the FBI since 1998. The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks[5] and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden. The request was dismissed by the U.S. as a meaningless delaying tactic and it launched Operation Enduring Freedom on 7 October 2001 with the United Kingdom.

Thanks for that. I'd also suggest bin laden was in hiding in Pakistan before the Towers hit the ground.
There's a lot to unpack here and I don't have the time to go into detail, particularly on your whataboutism paragraph but please explain how invading Iraq diminishes invading Ukraine or poisoning British citizens with chemical weapons.
Removed. Rule 10.
Yeah, he may not have even heard about 9/11 until days, maybe even weeks later.

Imagine his shock to learn that *he* was the "mastermind".

&gt; &gt; "*The Taliban declined to extradite him unless given what they deemed convincing evidence of his involvement in the 9/11 attacks[5"*] 

They're still waiting for that "convincing evidence". And so are we...

&gt; &gt; *"and ignored demands to shut down terrorist bases and hand over other terrorist suspects apart from bin Laden."*

Maybe for the same reason that Saddam "ignored demands" to hand over his WMD's? Because they didn't exist outside the realms of Western propagandist fantasy?
Russia has very little access to warm water ports for military use and for shipping and access to shipping lanes year round. Out of the very few  year round shipping ports, one is on the Crimean Peninsula, and another is in Syria. There are other factors regarding Russian foreign policy including oil and gas sales as Russia runs number two to the US in production, and also in arms sales as Russia once again runs second to the US and without those industries their economy would suffer mightily (even moreso I should say). There is also a great deal of history to unpack in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as it relates to Russian moves and motivations that can't be summed up quickly. Yet in direct regards to the Ukraine conflict and Syrian proxy war there is a reason, albeit simple, that Russia is involved and that is they would prefer to have access to warm water ports than not. It's not very flashy or exciting, but it is a reason why Russia, and its leadership, acts the way it does.
Yes absolutely this issue is complex and multi faceted but Russia has had ample opportunities for rapprochement with the West, Putin was one of the first to offer help after 9/11 and it seemed like there was a way forward, although Bush snubbed him. Then Obama attempted the ill fated "Russian reset" (misspelled in the photo shoot with Hillary - a bad omen?). Background events in Georgia and Ukraine scared Putin. At the same time there is a certain Russian and indeed American duplicity which makes any true rapprochement extremely fraught.
The US has wanted to overthrow Assad for years, for multiple reasons, and it was the US that massively aided the Ukrainian uprising against the Pro Russian leadership. You are correct that Putin could capitulate but at what cost? Let's say Russia lost both warm water ports - one in Syria and one in Ukraine/Crimea because of these uprisings - whether organic or otherwise. It would be catastrophic for Russia. The US has access to something like 100 (I could be mistaken but I believe it's high) warm water ports. Russia has a few and can't afford to lose any. If Putin let them go, he would be finished immediately and Russia would be weakened substantially. That would not sit well with their population or their military. So yes, Putin could reach out but also the US, and her allies, could stop pretending that it is a one way street and Putin is the only aggressor involved in these disputes. This issue is complex indeed.
&gt; There is also a great deal of history to unpack in Ukraine and Eastern Europe as it relates to Russian moves and motivations that can't be summed up quickly.

Actually, it can. Russia has spent most of it's history trying to conquer that area and a majority of Russians consider it Russian territory.
Removed. Rule 10
Dude, you're completely nuts. They weren't even hiding it or denying it. They were out in the open. You can find plenty of pictures them because they bragged about it and advertised them openly as a recruiting tactic. One of them was even [repurposed for training the Afghan national army](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnak_Farms) after the invasion. How can anyone be so incredibly dense. I can't believe anyone would actually try to argue this. Absolutely insane...

&gt; *"please explain how invading Iraq diminishes invading Ukraine*"

The US invaded Iraq. Russia did not "invade" Crimea. Russia/ Soviet Union/ Russia has had a persistent presence on the peninsula since the 1780's. It is the home port of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, and in 2010, made an agreement with Ukraine to extend their "lease" on the port in Sevastopol [through 2043.](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-extends-russian-naval-bases-lease-in-exchange-for-gas-discounts/a-5495790)

It should not be surprising that Russia would not be keen on surrendering their only warm-water because Ukraine's government was overthrown by a Western-backed coup. Nor shoud it be surprising that Crimeans, who are overwhelmingly Russian by ethnicity, would vote to join with Russia, rather than take their chances with the rogue Ukrainian government installed by the coup.

&gt; *"or poisoning British citizens with chemical weapons."* 

FIrst, whodunnit? I am utterly unconvinced that the Russian government was in ANY WAY involved. 

Moreover, *what is a "chemical weapon"?*

[**Brief Description of Chemical Weapons**](https://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/what-is-a-chemical-weapon/)

The general and traditional definition of a chemical weapon is a toxic chemical contained in a delivery system, such as a bomb or shell.

The Convention defines chemical weapons much more generally. The term chemical weapon is applied to ***any toxic chemical or its precursor that can cause death, injury, temporary incapacitation or sensory irritation through its chemical action***. Munitions or other delivery devices designed to deliver chemical weapons, whether filled or unfilled, are also considered weapons themselves.

The toxic chemicals that have been used as chemical weapons, or have been developed for use as chemical weapons, can be categorised as choking, blister, blood, or nerve agents. The most well known agents are as follows: choking agents—***chlorine*** and phosgene, blister agents (or vesicants)—mustard and lewisite, blood agents—hydrogen cyanide, nerve agents—sarin, soman, VX.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Under the broad definition, ANY poisonous, toxic, caustic, (etc) substance *could* be classified as a "chemical weapon" -- from bleach to insecticides -- but the aim of the  [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/articles/) and treaties was not to address the use of such materials in cases of simple MURDER (or assassination), rather it's aim was to prevent the use of such substances in warfare or similar acts against military or civilian targets on a large scale.

Calling the Novichuk allegations in Britain a *"chemical weapons attack"* is lowbrow hyperbole designed to elicit emotional responses from people to ignorant to know better.
Considering Kiev was the original heart of Russia it makes sense somewhat.  Nevertheless, Russian policies towards Ukraine have been terrible in many ways - most importantly the famine in the early 1930s which is a disturbing and disgusting action. Russia is not innocent at all in their treatment of Ukrainian people's and I do not want to defend Russian aggression towards Ukraine nor excuse it. But I think these issues should be examined from all sides so as to understand what is currently happening. The 20th century and early 21st have been tumultuous times in which the Russian people suffered terrible at the hands of enemies from outside and within. As a result Ukraine has been an important satellite for Russia throughout the later 20th century as the German invasion and threat of mass extinction by the West would have surely played a role on decision making over the last 75 years. If the West had its way, NATO would be on Russias doorstep which was agreed would not happen as it is clearly a sign of  aggression. Which is another important aspect of this situation that is barely discussed. If NATO keeps expanding Russia is left not only isolated but backed into a corner like a trapped animal once again worried about foreign invaders seeking the destruction of the Russian people. It almost happened 75 years ago but for the determination of those that kept fighting against the Nazis and helped defeat their war machine. Of course Russia should not act with aggression against Ukraine, but as I've said many times now their access to a warm water ports is of more strategic importance than upsetting people who desire stronger ties with Western powers who continue to show tremendous aggression towards Russia. Russia has been trapped between a rock and a hard place which is not helpful to any of us who desire peace.
Okay... So how many of the al Qaeda terrorists trained there do you suppose wound up in Syria under the name al Nusra, fighting against Assad's forces while being supported by Israel?

Yeah, don't feign ignorance.

Poor Russians. Never responsible themselves for anything that happens. 

&gt;If NATO keeps expanding

Sure. Blame those countries who were occupied by Russia for decades for wanting to be safe against new Russian aggression.
