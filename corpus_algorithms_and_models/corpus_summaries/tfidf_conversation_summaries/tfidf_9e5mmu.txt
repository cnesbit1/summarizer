Original Response:
From the article:

"Think of it this way: If you were to put an NHL team back in Quebec, how many new fans are you creating? Essentially none. The province of Quebec is now saturated with hockey fans, comprised of several generations of fans who grew up with the Montreal Canadiens and more who have reluctantly switched allegiance after the Nordiques’ departure left them no choice. Adding a team in Quebec City would not grow the fanbase, but simply reassign it. Despite an initially financially strong franchise, a dip in the Canadian dollar would lead to another financially precarious team, similar to the Ottawa Senators.

This is the same reason why you won’t see a new team in Markham or Hamilton, either. Nothing new created. A team in Hamilton would in fact be destructive to the Buffalo Sabres, who count on Canadian fans crossing the border to see games.

Nobody is arguing that there would be revenue generated by ticket sales, merchandising, and broadcast rights that would rival the most lucrative teams, but the problem in the long run would be saturation of the market, which would actually cause an inverse reaction in the devaluation of the franchises in the vicinity. So even though these Canadian sites would be strong revenue generators initially, it would be a myopic solution to the league’s larger plans."
though they talk about the possibility of putting a team in China and I find *that* pretty ridiculous, because even just the travel time between LA/China would be harsh, so I feel like the only sane way for them to schedule an overseas team would be to have them play a longer string of home games and then have the team do a longer string of road games in one geographic area. But it seems like that travel would be hell both for the China team and for teams here who had to travel across the ocean and back just to play one game over there.
Any thoughts on the possibility of us getting a team here in Seattle?
By that logic Minnesota never should've got the Wild.
I personally believe the next 2 teams awarded will be Seattle followed By Houston
By that logic why not move all Canadian teams to nontraditional markets since Canadians will still watch hockey? /s.  I don't support the argument. Honestly bringing back the Habs Nordiques rivalry would be some of the most must watch hockey around for anyone.

Throwing larger words into your shitty point doesn't make it stronger. The entire point of teams are to make money, and canadian NHL franchises **make money**. This point has been beaten to death over and over, but money is the #1 concern for every owner in the league and I guarantee most of them would vote to add a Canadian team. The issue is some prick named Jeremy Jacobs pretty much vetos everything to do with canadian markets.
You're personally wrong. Seattle will be the last expansion for a long while, and Houston will only get a team if there's a western conference relocation, most likely the Coyotes.
This writer also acts like french canadiens have shit loyalty and all moved over to the Canadiens after the Nordiques were gone. That's absolute bullshit, and bringing back the team would see a huge reemergence of fans.
32 teams seems to be the max any league is willing to go - there aren't any major US leagues that have gone beyond that, right?
The world could also use more of those white Nordique jerseys too, absolutely beautiful.
Before Vegas, only the NFL even had more than 30.
I think the only way having a non-NA team could work is if they dialled the number of games in a season down to 50/60, and that just wouldn't happen.
These are the voyages of Commissioner Bettman.  His continuing mission: to explore strange new hockey venues, to seek out new fans and new players, to boldly go where no Commissioner has gone before.

That's so false. The writer has no idea what he's talking about.

All the Nordiques fan are now Bruins fans, or watch every Habs game cheering for the opponent team. 

The only fans they are loosing and people born after 1995. Most of the kids do not carry the hate towards the Habs like they parents are doing, and they cheer for the Habs.
Lets not forget the beer wars. 

 Labatt(Nordiques) and Molson(Habs) had fierce marketing battles.

And crowds were rowdy. The next day banter was ridiculous.

I would much rather have those playoff atmosphere games and day after banter about both teams then the current Habs circle jerk in the Montreal media" yeah they won by 3 but let me tell you how we need to shuffle the lines one more time. 


I also heard back then, Hurricanes fans were given cheat sheet as to what the penalties were... 

This is all I can think of when they keep trying to expand in the south.. delayed cheers an boos.
honestly. look at patrice fucking bergeron for christs sake
let's move the habs to mexico city
Yeah, usually new fans don't immediately grasp every single rule and penalty
I think you’re missing the point. Say you have Franchise A that is making $1b per year. Then you add a second Franchise B 50 miles away. 

Franchise B makes $400m per year, but Franchise A’s profits drop to $600m per year. 

Total profits stayed the same at $1b. It’s just now being split between two franchises instead of one. 

That’s the argument he is making. There are flaws in the argument, but you should address the argument he’s actually making. Not the straw man you constructed.
Nope, most North American leagues only have a couple of Canadian teams at the most though so there's definitely more potential markets in the US.
No major US league had more than 20 teams until one did. No major US league had more than 30 teams until one did. 

The general trend has been up. I could see at some point the NHL hitting 40 teams. At that point they’d have to reduce down only playing out of conference teams to once per season probably instead of the twice we do now.
Wait what? That logically makes no sense. The closest team at the time to Minnesota was either Winnipeg (in another country) or Chicago (over 5-7 hours away). There was no team in Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota or Iowa. Chicago was the closet team and it's not even in the same state, much less shared any borders with Minnesota. Montreal is what? 2 hours away? 3 hours away? And probably in the same market as Quebec City. 

I'm trying to follow your logic here.
I don't see what's wrong with people in nonstandard markets not knowing the rules on day one? Teaching interested people what hockey is all about is how you build a fanbase. I don't think fans in Nashville knew every single thing in October 1998 but they seem to be doing well now.
Flair checks out.
Not all Canadian teams do. With the arena quarrel in Calgary, the public learned the team went from a maker to a taker.
I honestly believe the Seattle team is as sure as anything, it's just when.  That creates a new market in a city that has shown that it is one of the most passionate sport fan bases in North America.  I think it's clear Seattle wants one, and it's clear the NHL wants one, it's just making it work for everyone involved.
IIRC it was the hurricanes secured their second playoff berth
But had a couple of years in the league.
Well the owners stated that. 

If it's true or not is still up for discussion.
TBH I could genuinely see the NHL going to 36 in the near future because they have a much stronger presence in Canada compared to the other big four and thus have more room to expand to the US. I don't see them going more that that though - at some point you need empty cities to serve as relocation threats for tax muns.
You're entirely missing the point, which is that they're all still watching hockey. Only thing the NHL cares about is creating new TV markets.
Or invoke pro/rel
What he is saying is Minnesota already had hockey fans.  We did, they were just sending money on the NCAA and high schools and not the NHL.  I assume QC citizens feel the same way, supporting QMJHL or other minor leagues and not the NHL.
Does Houston have any willing ownership.  Vegas and Seattle have both had ownership that had been passionate for years about getting the NHL to these cities.
so it's a matter of time before he's right?
And I’m sure Quebec City can destroy whatever tv numbers that Arizona, Carolina, and Florida do.
Exactly, when Minny wasn't with a team, we didn't cheer for another NHL franchise, we cheered for the college teams and the high schools.  I can't imagine QC is any different.  Sure they are hockey fans, just hockey fans spending money on leagues that aren't the NHL.
If by matter of time you mean 25-30 years, then yes.
Quebec City has the Ramparts of the QMKHL which draws 13,000 fans on average which ranks it among the Arizonas and Carolinas of the NHL.  Junior hockey drawing those kind of numbers is pretty damn good and indicative that fans there love hockey.  Even here with the Oil Kings we don't see those attendance numbers unless there is a deep playoff run.
The NFL hasn't even gone that far (it went up to 32 with Houston in 2002) though they could very well put another team in Texas and one in Toronto and have no problems.
I think the point is more about NHL fans than hockey fans. Canadians on Quebec and Hamilton were still following NHL teams (Montreal/Buffalo) whereas folks in Minnesota followed college or high school hockey. By bringing the Wild in, the created new fans of the NHL out of college hockey fans.
Honest question how much does the NHL make off of TV? I thought it was minuscule.
It's already in the works! It's expected you'll get a team for the 2020-21 or 2021-22 season. Depending on whether the NHL goes to a lockout and when the city finally caves and allows them to renovate key arena which I think was the latest news.
That’s the point. Quebec, Hamilton, Thunder Bay, and Wood Buffalo already crush Florida, Carolina, and Arizona in tv numbers. So there isn’t much if anything to gain there. Because of revenue sharing on broadcast rights, the incentive for the league is to increase the total number of televisions tuned to the nhl. If TVs in Quebec and Hamilton are already tuned to the NHL there is very little financial incentive, beyond the short term gains that would be near equivalent in a market like Seattle or Houston, to expand into a market where hockey is already watched in most households. Whether it be the Bruins or the Canadians. TV is where the league makes its money. And since the league decides which teams can expand or relocate to which markets. They’ll keep propping up unsuccessful southern franchises because the emergence of a market like Nashville or Tampa Bay is a dramatic increase in revenue and a huge selling point on the next league wide broadcast rights contract.

I’d love to see the nordiques or the whalers come back. But I don’t think it’s realistic with the current CBA structure.
Relative to the MLB, NFL or NBA the NHL’s broadcast rights don’t go for much. But it’s still a primary source of income for the league as a whole.
You’re getting downvotes but you’re right.
Hamilton gets about 4000 on a good night and it's technically a sell-out at 8500 because the upper deck of the arena is curtained off.

The Remparts getting 13k day in, day out is pretty telling about how Quebec feels about hockey.
It's a primary revenue driver man. The Rogers deal was for over a billion dollars just in canada, and each team gets regional right to sell as well. The Sens snagged one with TSN recently for a reported price of up to 400 million over 10 years or whatever.
No one who paid 500 MM on a franchise is going to be okay with the possibility of going to a second tier if the team has a bad season. I agree it's something that would be nice to happen, but it won't here. It works in other countries because it's been working for decades. If the Premier league didn't have pro/rel they wouldn't implement it now.
I get the regional rights it was the national ones I was questioning. I fully believeLeafs tv rights are lucrative...Arizona not so much.
Agreed, but a man can dream.
The NHL is willing to go to 34 (and eventually 36) if ownership groups are willing to pony up money.
I believe you're wrong as the NHL is willing to go to 34 teams. Houston and Portland both want teams, but the NHL doesn't want to introduce too many teams in a short period like they did in the 90's. You have to space it out. Houston or Portland will be granted the next expansion team after Seattle. With the other city getting team #34. Quebec is strictly a relocation option in case there are ownership/arena issues (much like how the NFL used the Los Angeles market to leverage local municipalities into paying for stadiums)

Summary:
I think the point is more about NHL fans than hockey fans.
Not all Canadian teams do.
TV is where the league makes its money.
The entire point of teams are to make money, and canadian NHL franchises **make money**.
With the other city getting team #34.
I could see at some point the NHL hitting 40 teams.
