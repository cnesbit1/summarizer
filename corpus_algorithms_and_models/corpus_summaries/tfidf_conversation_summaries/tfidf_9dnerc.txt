The first red pills are the hardest.
Thank you u/ApocalypseFox for seeing the truth.
Same here. I voted for Obama and thought Biden was cool, NOW? 
Notsomuch.
I just can't believe how he acts like the cameras aren't there, and it's like he's in his own little psycho Pedo bubble and is oblivious to everyone else in the room. Gross and scary...
I never liked Biden.  He may be a decent orator, but he sets off the slim ball creep alarm every time I see him.  Honestly though his linguistic mannerisms and speech patterns just come off as sleazy.  He's the dangerous kind too because he's not an overt asshole like Trump, however there's a very thin line that separates the two.  What's even more interesting is that they don't see themselves as equals but as opponents.  They're essentially in the same camp.
Guess who Biden was meeting with on the morning of September 13, 2001.
I am glad hard evidence is able to sway your opinion. Too many people just don't give a shit about anything but their own biases
Clear as day. The girl has the same reaction as Ariana to the pastor. And you can see his fingers squeeze doesnt look like an accident
I mean, there is like an hour plus of footage of this guy molesting children. Like what the fuck.

It honestly is super baffling to me, but actually gives a massive amount of credibility to these conspiracies that have taken over the right wing. Which is actually a scary thing.

Also this guy is so brazen in public, cant help but think he does way way worse privately.
You are of the few and the sane in this world.
Coming from the LatexGimpLord? What a fucking joke
