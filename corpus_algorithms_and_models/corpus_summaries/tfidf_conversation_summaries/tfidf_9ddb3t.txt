Original Response:
When we cut down trees we make piles of chips. When you have a pile of something it can smolder and turn into a fire.  The center of mass gets so hot it catches fire. 

Also everything here on Earth has a spontaneous combustion point. 
You get it hot enough and it will catch on fire. 
Put anything close to lava and im sure fire will happen.
How is it the chips start smoldering in the first place?

Fermentation of the wet organic matter creates heat. The heat makes the reaction accelerate, which generates more heat, and _voila_, spontaneous combustion. It can happen to big rolls of paper, too, if the damp paper wasn’t sufficiently dry when rolled.
Decomposition is an exothermic process. A common problem where large piles of wood chips are stacked (mulch piles, etc). With enough air into the pile and enough decomposing material, fire can and does happen.

 decomposing material also releases methane, which in the right environment can be ignited by sparks from a convenient rockfall.

It’s even been discovered that spontaneous fission reactions have take place in pockets of fissile ore that reach critical mass.

It happens with hay too if the moisture content is too high. When I was a kid there was a giant hah storage barn that burned to the ground because one of the bales spontaneously combusted and set all the rest on fire.

This can be a problem with backyard composting. It's one of the reasons you're supposed to turn over your compost from time to time.

The main reason you turn a compost pile is to aerate it. You're supposed to have adequate drainage and not compost large amounts of certain types of grass if wet to keep it from catching fire.

wow really? just with nothing but the decomposition? was it particularly hot in the area?

Don’t know about op but I can answer for my country. It’s not usually hot here. We usually get a couple of weeks in the summer of good dry weather where we can cut and dry the hay before storing it. A neighbouring farmer had his hay shed catch on fire because of this during rain shortly after bringing all his hay in.

It was funnily enough the rain that essentially caused the whole thing. He had made the hay and usually if it’s sunny you leave the bales out where they can dry in the sun. Unfortunately it was set to rain a few days after he baled the hay so he brought it in early when it was still wet and stacked them tightly in his shed. One or more of them started to essentially rot in the middle where or was wettest and warmest and the bacteria responsible for the rotting gave off enough heat to cause the bake to catch fire
It doesn't really matter what temperature it is especially if it's in a barn. I'm sure there's a lower boundary but straw is great insulation.

The various microbes respiring generate both heat and volatile by-products like methane and ethanol and that's a risky mix.

Compost heaps get very hot in the middle, particularly if you put too much grass on them.
So how hot do I need to get to spontaneously combust? Asking for a friend.

I don't get that. Isn't fermentation something that's microorganisms do? If it gets too hot they die and the fermentation stops, right?

When I was a kid I used to look for snakes in my neighbours garden as his compost heap of cut grass was always warm which reptiles love. One day I stuck my arm into it and nearly burnt my hand. I got inquisitive, took pitchfork, stuck it in to the big pile and lifted it up exposing the middle: it immediately burst into flames. I dropped the fork and it all went out. Walked away whistling, never told anyone.
I was more curious if this could happen in winter, since its cold enough to keep the temps low? or can it even overpower pretty cold weather?

In parts it would be too hot, but in places it isn’t. It’s an exothermic reaction and the whole thing accelerated as the process goes along.
Well this was autumn in the UK so certainly not a warm climate. It's microbial/fungal activity which creates the heat and then the hay insulates it so the heat builds up. The centre is so hot that it kills off the microbes but they live in the safe zone around the edge where the heat enables them to multiply even faster so it's an exponential reaction.

I have personally witnessed bark mulch catch fire while sitting and eating my lunch in a park.  To this day it is the strangest thing I've ever witnessed.
Pistacchios can catch fire if in great quantities and uñstacked under pressure. Like on a shipping container.

This is why a lot of suburban yard waste facilities have multiple big effing signs that say "no grass clippings" and a lot of morons ignore the signs.
Hay will catch fire if baled up wet because of that. It smells like caramel when it's gonna happen.

It can happen in winter also, the outside temp doesn't matter much. I had a compost pile next to my garden that let off lots of steam in the winter when the conditions were right. It never caught fire. In hay barns when damp hay or straw starts to rot, sometimes the hay doesn't burst into flames but smolders until finally going out on its own leaving a black charred hole in the stack of bales or loose mound. Most of the time you just get moldy hay though.

Heat released from the material degrading/fermenting.

There's not much heat, but if it's well insulated the heat can't escape and the center gets hot enough to smolder.

The exact same thing happens with piles of oily rags. The oil will heat up as bacteria and yeasts in the environment start to break it down, or even just as it oxidizes with the air.

I worked once with a farmer who had a big compost heap.  Even on a mild day you could dig your arm into the pile and if you went elbow deep, it was usually too hot to hold your hand there for more than a few seconds.

I’ve had this happen to a pile of wood chips in my yard from a tree I chopped down and shredded

My municipality is heavily forested and many of the neighborhoods are old and built in amongst the trees, rather than modern developments where everything is clear-cut first. As a result we have leaf collection provided by the counties around here in the fall. If you drive past any of the waste transfer sites you can see massive piles of wet leaves smoldering as a result of the same process. Always wigged me out as a kid.

Something similar also happens naturally in the forest. Trees fall, years of dried pine needles, other decomposing bits of plant matter/dead animals/feces/etc. These all can lead up to a natural forest fire. It is actually how a forest feeds/regenerates itself.
If it rains on a hay bale you're safe. But if it rains on the cut hay you're screwed. It ruins the quality of the hay and if you bale it while damp it will rot and eventually combust. Baled hay is too dense to allow the moisture to penetrate it.
It happens with hay too. That is why you can not cut and bale hay when it is wet outside or if the plant itself has too much water content. That was one of the main causes of barn fires back in the day.

Happens here all the damn time with bailed cotton. Super strange, but moisture will eventually set them on fire from the inside.
