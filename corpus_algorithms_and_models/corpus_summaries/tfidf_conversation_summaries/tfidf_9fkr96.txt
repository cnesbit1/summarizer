Sharks are now the Apex predator of the Pacific

Ummm Ducks? Lol and not to mention Vegas, there’s plenty of competition
And Oilers if they get their shit together this year.

It’s a tight race for the second Pacific spot

Edit: holy shit I’m dumb, Vegas is in the Pacific.

And the Flames are looking really good too
0-4
One series.. theyve been top two in the division for like 8 years in a row
Ugh not if these California teams keep landing star players.
Yes..? Why is that such a shock to everyone here?
Ducks have no Kessler, a Corey Perry that aged like milk since Carlyle got hired, then you have to factor in Gibson's annual groin injury Ducks are below the SHarks, Kings, Knights in terms of power I wouldnt even be shocked if Arizona finally gets their shit together and out does them this year. Anaheim has never looked this mortal before

Shhh just let them have their moment
people don't like us
&gt; Anaheim has never looked this mortal before

except for last season when half the team was AHLers and yet still made it to 2nd in the Pacific ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Summary:
Anaheim has never looked this mortal before.
And Oilers if they get their shit together this year.
