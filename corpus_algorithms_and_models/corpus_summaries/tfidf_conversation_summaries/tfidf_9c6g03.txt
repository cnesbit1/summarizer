Your family is being rude in this situation. They’re excluding your wife and not making an effort to respond to her brave attempts to engage. My suggestion? Don’t visit once a week. That’s a ton of time for your wife to spend isolated and awkward. Ask your family to speak in English when she is present - but ask for yourself, not for her. Stop tolerating their very rude behavior. You’re her husband. Stand up for her like you are.
I was going to say the same thing. Your family is being **intentionally rude**. I could understand if this was a once a year thing and they weren't really fluent in English. But you are visiting weekly and they are, they should be making a bigger effort to include your wife. 

&gt; I tried introducing topics that they have in common and I translate for Emma all the time but nothing seems to be working out well. 

The issue here is that instead of translating and trying to force conversation when YOUR family had no desire to make an attempt to socialize with the woman you CHOSE to marry, you should have called them out on their rude behavior and refused to visit until they changed their attitude. Your wife is in a foreign country for you, surrounded by a language she doesn't understand and you have allowed your family to treat her as unwelcomed guest in their home . 

If I was your wife your family wouldn't be the only ones I started recenting and if things keep going down this path, they won't be.

I understand them not wanting to speak English at their family gathering when they are likely all bad at it. (My dad's family is french, and a lot of them "speak English" but wouldn't be able to hold family dinner in it. However, several of those OP's age actually do.) I also can understand that if they had to speak English the whole time they might not feel comfortable or enjoy themselves.

But they are being rude. They are doing *nothing* to include OP's wife. You should go one week without her and have a conversation with everyone about how you don't feel supported and feel like they care about you enough to care about your wife. That while you don't expect them to switch the meals to English, we as a group need to brainstorm ways in which we can include her and make sure she has a good time. 

There are lots of good ideas for that on this thread already. Here are some borrowed and some of mine:

* Do some activities like cooking something together or a board game where you can participate with limited language skills

* Someone takes turns making an effort to engage her in more simple conversation. Or everyone makes the effort to engage her in one simple conversation each week, so between all of them she's getting a lot of attention.

* They are more cooperative in your efforts to translate a bit and talk about things with common interests.

* I assume some of the kids are learning English? Maybe the kids could talk to her in English to practice? Or their could be a part of the meal, like dessert or something, where everyone speaks English just for that little while? 

Whatever ideas your family has? It would also be a chance for family to bring up whatever frustrations and feelings they have without wife around so you can work them out.

I don't think they're intentionally rude. First, French people are not often really good in English. Especially in speaking English. Although they speak English, they may feel embarrassed when they do. 

Second, it's really difficult to maintain a conversation in a second language especially when there's only one person who cannot speak the 1st language.
No, they are just being rude. 

&gt; . At the begginig she tried approaching them them but they often replied to her questions quite short (she asked my sister how was her trip to spain and my sister replied only: Great, interesting.) 

This is someone being rude. 

Excluding someone from a conversation is being rude.

This is not a French thing. This is not a language barrier thing. This is a being rude hosts thing.

I have met people who did not speak English or Spanish and still made an attempt to talk to me even if they were butchering those two languages so I could at least feel included because that is what decent people do. 

They don't need to speak English 100% of the time, but asking questions here and there, answering her own questions with more than two words, etc. That is just common decency.
Well they can also reply short answers because they don't like speaking English. 

Listen, I don't know if they're just plain rude or if it's a language barrier. As a French person, I know that the teaching of foreign languages in my country is quite poor and that most people I know are not only bad at languages, but also easily embarrassed when trying to speak in another language.

Also I really get annoyed that the most common answer on this sub seems to be : cut people off! Do not try to understand or compromise. Put boundaries and enforced them. 

And I'm not saying that people shouldn't have boundaries and enforced them. But I'm saying that cutting someone off should be a last resort when dealing with toxic people. Now that's not what I'm reading here.
&gt; I don't know if they're just plain rude 

They're plain rude.

Summary:
But they are being rude.
This is someone being rude.
&gt; I don't know if they're just plain rude 

They're plain rude.
Your family is being **intentionally rude**.
I was going to say the same thing.
This is not a French thing.
