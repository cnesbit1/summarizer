48 grand is way above minimum
This guy makes $12 an hour and thinks me makes $100,000 a year.
If someone makes 34k USD per year theyâ€™re in the top 1% of the world.
It's about 5k above the minimum wage to qualify for a visa.
2000hrs per year x $10.75 = $21500

TIL $40000 = $21500
That sounds like total bullshit.

So of course I turned to Google and holy shit you're right.
If you read the article, it includes housing. Singapore tax rate is very low. At US $48,000, you'll probably be taxed 7.5% only.
Still a good deal though. You'll get free housing(which is expensive here in Singapore) and Singapore income tax is very low. I think that salary falls at the 7.5% annual tax range.

It's illegal to pay 14 year Olds that here
it is bullshit. a lot of poorer economies don't use wages and instead use objects. i remember reading about places in africa that do almost no meaningful exchanges with money, but with goats/livestock. people's wealth was determined by how much livestock they had, and calculations like the one above don't account for that.
What if you're 15?

Where's here ?
No it isn't. 48k USD is 65k SGD. Free housing means total comp is at least 85k SGD, nearly double the 43k SGD required for a visa.
Yes you're right about the error in USD and SGD.
The internet

Summary:
Singapore tax rate is very low.
Yes you're right about the error in USD and SGD.
