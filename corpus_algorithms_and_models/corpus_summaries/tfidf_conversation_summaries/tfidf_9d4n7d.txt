Well good job whales im so turned off from crypto that I'm going to make point to tell anyone I know to avoid it the like the plauge and for them to tell others, most of my friends take my word as I take there's very seriously and respect it, old school word of mouth still goes a long way, again congrats whales there some adoption for you...... lik
e how fu*in greedy are you ??
I hope I don't get the plauge, it is unknown to medical science so has no cure.
that was some nice word diarrhea
oh boy! if you and your 3 friends don't buy crypto how can it survive?
If you had read some other posts, it would appear that Goldman Sachs had a lot to do with what is probably a temporary fall. I made an initial purchase May 6th, I am still in the black despite the price being maybe 30% lower now. Doesn't matter to me one whit if you quit or not, but on balance I give your post a 10 out of 10 for whining, 0 out of 10 for informing other people.
oh, as an aside, your English is really really bad. "I'm going to make point to tell". Do you mean "I'm going to make a point of telling", also "there's" I assume is "theirs", hmmm, usually "old school" = good school and you obviously did not go there...
Bs this is about the 10 or 11 time I've watched it go up then back down with in the last few months pure fuckin maniuplation
you see how much $$$ coinbase has made? as long as you are willing to hand them money, they will take it. P2P only
no, this is leveon bell's fault. as soon as he was ruled out of week 1, BTC took a dump.  people cashed out to bet against the steelers.  It's pretty clear what happened. I shorted with 10x leverage as soon as I saw the post. Caaaaa f'in ching!
Theory would hold more water if they weren't playing the Browns.
I don't know the whales and how poor or rich they are does not change my life. I heard about crypto it was a nerd domain worth pennies. Now it's worth over 6 k in less than a decade. This kind of thing comes along once in a lifetime, so when you're telling your friends about it try to remember the fact that it's gone up more than any stock they could hope to invest in and will likely continue to for years and years to come.
Are you telling me you wouldn't do the same thing if you could make money from it?
