2) Explicitly spelling out the word voids the entire point of referring to it as "r-word" in the first place
Besides the point that I think they are referring to me, or maybe I am imagining things.

its offensive to people who are really mentally handicapped.
its quite a hot topic in America. people used it in America all the time as a derogatory slur. There were articles written on the r-word.Now its a Singapore thing too.

You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded
