Probably they were busy?

You're not going on vacation tomorrow, right? You have some time. Give them a day. And then you have all the right to be butthurt. At least, I would be, after a day.

I mean, do that all the time.

yes. some people are not glued to their phones these days. I get home from the gym at 7:45, probably dont look at my phone again until bed time. im 28.

if you are this crazy and upset over him not answering in a few hours, to the point of posting on reddit....dont be concerned if anyone ever says you have crazy eyes.

I think you need to just relax a little bit. Heaven forbid they are just busy or thinking about their answer before replying...

You see, the thing is that going on a vacation is not something you decide casually. It takes time. I usually reserve such conversations for the end of the day when I'm free and can devote my time to the topic. Meanwhile during the day, I fuck around doing whatever I like. Casually.

You are being kinda crazy here. Analyzing all these factors and counting the hours is a little oppressive. Maybe he is in mixed company and can't really devote time or thought to a full response, but can casually check facebook for a moment. Or literally anything else at all.

Hey. Relax. What are your hobbies? Get on it. It'll get your mind off of it. Update us as soon as he replies.

Here we go. Your 'him not replying' problem solved. Cheers. Don't try to overthink such situations from now on. 
And about the nature of his reply, that's an entirely different thing.

PM, if you can.
Yeah, crazy how people can go on with their lives while still contemplating their answer to something. Just because my gf asks where I want to go to dinner and I dont answer but still post stuff and reply to other people doesnt mean I hate her? lmao. it just means i dont know the answer to her question yet.

You should post his FB, I think we need to warn him about you lol. I am not trying to be mean but the amount of times you posted this in different subs is genuinely crazy. why is it such a big deal in a matter of hours? what were you expecting to hear posting to all these places? If I were him and saw all this paranoia you posted, I would be long gone.

he is...what I can assume..a young teenage or early 20 year old dude. he is not reading any more in between the lines of it than you think. He is either going to say yes or no, not judge you for asking in the slightest. that is 100% you over thinking it. Just relax and let him get back to you. Honestly, like I said, imagine he saw all this stuff you posted. He is going to think you are nuts. Thats the only judgement he will do, not for you asking a nice polite question that shouldn't take any offense. I would definitely look into getting some help for your anxiety though if you do not already. Your reaction was not how the normal person would react.

something doesnt add up though. why would one of your very limited posts be on a roast me sub. if you have such anxiety and insecurity issues, why would you post somewhere where people are gonna trash talk you. its like you enjoy walking into the flame. thats odd...

yeah but your replies dont suggest what you just said. you said you come here to gain perspective and make better decisions. yet when we all tried to rationalize it and say he might be busy or just still decide, you continuously made negative comments saying "he is all over facebook". its like you were wanting him to ignore you or wanting it to be a problem. you did not come here unbiased and read/react to peoples opinions.

I think it would be worth noting, by two months in, if you have this severe of an anxiety problem. that is something he needs to be ready to handle. again, imagine if he read all this. you are basically keeping a secret judgemental side of yourself away from him, and coming to reddit for relief. I would check and see if he is ready to deal with all of this before going on vacation. Some guys might not want to date someone with anxiety problems. I would get that out in the open first and see how he takes it.

crazy to me though that you would offer to take him on vacation, where you are stuck together, when even you just admitted there are a lot of things he does not know about you.

Summary:
I mean, do that all the time.
