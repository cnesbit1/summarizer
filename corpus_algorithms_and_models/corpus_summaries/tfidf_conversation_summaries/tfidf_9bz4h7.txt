Original Response:
To be fair, I think the track should’ve moved the sandbags and smoothed out the surrounding dirt around the track to get rid of the funnels. 

Also to be fair, the guy is riding a Panigale 1199 and can’t make that turn? Bro get some skill. 

Now he’s spouting off that he thinks everyone should ride his stupid c-1 concept bike... “I wouldn’t have gotten hurt as bad as I did if I had been driving the C-1.” No, you wouldn’t have gotten hurt if you pushed harder on the handlebar you idiot.

Plus, he just looks like a D-Bag.

Nobody wants to drive that skinny car.
That's like a bad take on the [Carver one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye8MI39VTrA)
He even stole the name “C-1.”
Wouldn't of got hurt as bad if he was driving the C-1? Also would never experience physical contact with another human again because that thing is *atrocious*.
So his project was to make a Monotracer look as ugly as possible?
“Your rolling smart phone.” Wow, I dislike it more than I thought I would.

Half the Point of a motorcycle is being out in the elements in the saddle. 

That thing isn't a motorcylce in my eyes. It's a 2wheeled car.
To be fair, he would suffer no injuries because it couldn't go 80mph.
It’s as if he didn’t even try to bounce that “rolling smartphone” idea off a single person before going to market with it, because surely everyone but him thinks that’s a stupid way to try and sell whatever that thing is.

C-1, C1 what does that remind me of... ^^^cough ^^^BMW
It looks like the car Peter Gregory (RIP) drove in Silicon Valley.
