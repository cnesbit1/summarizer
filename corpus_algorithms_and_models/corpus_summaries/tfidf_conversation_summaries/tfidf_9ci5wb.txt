Everything is essentially the same with higher stats. Higher rarity is better, higher level is better, that's it. No gear has any unique combat effects.
Thank you, well at least ascended gear looks amazing. Fashion is the real endgame after all
Legendary armor and weapons to have unique abilities (stat changing) and effects. Just saying...
Legendary has unique combat effects...
Thanks, look forward to finding some, in fractals if im not wrong?
As i said im new to the game, still a little lost. Thanks though
No, you will only get ascended in Fractals... You must build legendary weapons and armor.

Gen 1 legendary weapons are easy (and you can buy them with enough gold). Gen 2 Legendary weapons are a pain in the ass to craft.

Legendary armor will take you 4-6 months of either Raid, PvP, or WvW farming to do. 

There is a legendary back item you can build in fractals and it is pretty easy to do while you are learning fractals.
Those are visual effects. By "combat effects" I think he meant that there's no combat advantage to having any particular piece of gear vs. any other piece of the same level and rarity.
Ya, I guess I can see that... But the ability to change stats is huge and a unique thing.
OP was looking for unique effects that modify your skills or create additional damaging/support effects, like WoW legendaries. Stat changing and visual effects are not unique combat effects.
That guy is being misleading. Legendary items are entirely for their appearance only. They offer no extra combat effects.

Summary:
Legendary has unique combat effects...
Legendary armor and weapons to have unique abilities (stat changing) and effects.
