Since metagross is one of my favourite pkmn, I really would like to have one of these. Here is my spreadsheet:  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dM-yq\_l8jrLZ0ZfMDc7w74lGH4Qf9o1DbIM0XUPkplY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dM-yq_l8jrLZ0ZfMDc7w74lGH4Qf9o1DbIM0XUPkplY/edit#gid=0)

Hello Skilled_Hunter27!

Origin: I've had it since I redeemed the code.

Where did this take place?
It was a code distribution. I got mine from a GAME stop.
So you redeemed this Marshadow yourself?
Yup
OK. So when the rules say "origin" they don't mean where the code came from, were asking who redeemed the code. Because you're not trading a code, you're trading the Marshadow. Just as a future reference.

So if you could edit your original comment with all the information I can go ahead a re-approve it.
Curious why you deleted your comment?
