Original Response:
They're still recommending bong over other methods.
Easier on the lungs at least. Pipes can be harsh
As long as you change your damn bong water...
And put ice in it when you change it.
Surprised they haven't switched to vaporizers.
I know absolutely nothing about bongs so I'm curious why you'd put ice? What does it do?
When I used to smoke (I don't any more because of personal reasons), it felt like a cleaner, cooler hit so to speak. 

An ex of mine used to put ice in their bong, and that was their reasoning.

I’ve actually heard that putting ice in the bong can give you bronchitis some how.
Ain't nobody got time for that
I started doing hot hits with hot bong water and it actually feels smoother, weird I know.
There's a lot of bad science in there...
Gotta say it...switch to vaping and never look back
i prefer edibles.
Definitely don't mind am edible when I want to feel groovy for half the day. I referred to vaping in contrast to smoking of any kind.
This is isn't necessarily true. That user clearly isn't educated in biology/pharmacology. 

&gt;  works well at lowering your core body temperature, which decreases your ability to fight off infections

The study he posts says this "**Although not all studies agree**, most of the available evidence from laboratory and clinical studies **suggests** that inhaled cold air, cooling of the body surface and cold stress induced by lowering the core body temperature cause pathophysiological responses such as vasoconstriction in the respiratory tract mucosa and suppression of immune responses, which are responsible for increased susceptibility to infections."**

This study is taking into consideration cold winter air, not air/smoke passing over ice in a bong. I live in Canada. The air is cold for like half the year here. We're doing fine. Additionally, air passing over ice won't be as cold as air sitting at an ambient temperature of 20 below, which is par for the course for a Canadian winter. 

He also says this. 

&gt; These factors make you more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia, which recently happened to an acquaintance of mine who caught pneumonia a few days after investing in an ice bong (which was then copiously used ).

Pure coincidence, and its honestly super silly they suggest that the pneumonia was from an ice loaded bong. There are a myriad of other factors (environmental and genetic) that need to be considered. Pneumonia is a virus, which needs to be inhaled. They could have just gotten it from a friend who also used the bong, but that friend didn't have the virus in their lungs. If the temperature of air/smoke passing through ice is enough to make you susceptible to pneumonia, then people in cold climates would be generally fucked.
I don't get high off edibles :(
How is that possible.

Edibles are great

It certainly is. I have a degree in biotech and have taken pharmacology courses if you would like to discuss why it is.

I smoke like a quarter a week, for like 8 years now. I frequent medical dispensaries, even 90 mg + don't do shit.  

Friends have eaten and border-line fainted off slivers of brownies they made. I ate massive chunks, nothing.

When smoked thc avoids first pass metabolism (straight through your alveoli into your bloodstream, no liver). 

When combusted the thc found on the plant is converted to the active form, which binds with receptors. 

When you ingest it, it passes through your liver and is metabolized by your body. There are genetic factors at play here, as people with any sort of genetic variable (such a SNP/single nucleotide polymorphism) will cause people to not produce the protein/enzyme(s) responsible for metabolizing thc, leaving it in a form that does not bind to receptors.
Tolerance isn't the issue, my friends who smoke as much as I do get high off of 90 mg (thats widely regarded as somewhat potent, even among stoners). I have never felt a high from any edible. 

My brother doesn't even smoke and doesn't get high off edibles.

When combusted/inhaled theres no genetic factors other than abundance of cannibidiol receptors that will affect your high. 

When ingested, it must pass through the liver/first pass metabolism. This is when genetic factors come into play. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (single changes in a base of a gene) can alter proteins/enzymes enough that drugs can/will have less affect, different effect or no effect on users. Thats why there are a myriad of symptoms for drugs on commercials, even though the average person is likely not going to experience them. Everyone reacts to drugs differently. 

edit: also just google 'don't get high off edibles' and you'll come across many people claiming the same thing. People with IBS commonly claim this as well. May be digestive tract issues more than first pass metabolism, or both

You know what's better for your lungs? Not smoking.
you know what's better for your body than inhaling particulates? not doing that.
Do you feel smart?
[deleted]
Have not yet gotten high off an edible, and I smoke every single day. don't go spouting off on things you don't even begin to understand.
I've eaten 1000mg and still had nothing.
[deleted]
me too.
Of course this would get downvoted.
Why would it not get downvoted? Yeah its true but everyone knows this, and they weren't asking for that opinion, he's just chiming in with something people already know.
Everyone knows this already? Pretty sure every smoker accepts the risk to the lungs, everyone who drinks accepts a potential risk to the liver, etc. Life is short man, as long as you aren't bothering anyone else, I don't see the issue,
Because it's condescending and doesn't add anything to the conversation.
Yea and not drinking is better for you than not smoking weed, and smoking tobacco is worse than both. Also, not eating processed sugars is better for you too. Oh, and living in a big city has pollution that rivals smoking in terms of health effects. 

There are plenty of things that are unhealthy that we still consume. Every person deserves thee ability to decide how much they fuck up their own health
Smoking weed out of a bong does no permanent damage to your lungs. Byeeeee
I sometimes get high for a bit but then just burn out for 3 hours and it is very expensive comparatively. Switched to vaping.
But also I don't always have 6 hours to be baked. A vape sesh is a nice clean feel for a couple hours
Yep, [reddit bugmen love their weed.](https://imgflip.com/i/2hfcqr)
Yup, smoking ice vapors are actually pretty not good for you from what I’ve been told.
Makes it hit way smoother (less coughing and pain)
certain people lack the enzymes to break down edibles into a psychoactive form.
I'm in the same boat... I hardly feel them either. Except the next day I get super lethargic. Who knows, maybe I've just tried shitty edibles?

Summary:
I don't get high off edibles :(
