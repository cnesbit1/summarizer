Original Response:
So it's my first time getting SS coils. They are 24 GA simple coils. Whatever juice or cotton I use I get this weird chemicals taste and smell :/ 

It happens like 80% of the coils I tried while in some rare cases they vape just fine.

Is the issue on my end? What's going on?
Did you wash your hands?  Did you follow proper procedure for prepping SS coils?
I did wash my hands. I actually even wash my hands in between stuff while changing coils and cotton simply cause I can't stand the oily feeling of having eliquid on your hands.


... What do you mean prepping?
SS cannot be dry fired the same as ni80 or kanthal.  Have to use low power else you'll roast the coil and it'll taste like shit.

That should help
Also, are you making these coils from a roll of 24g?  Are they prewrapped?  Where did you get them?
I was firing it at 30-40 . Might've been why. Thanks!! I'll try tomorrow again and I'll report back!
You're not supposed to let it glow really either iirc. I don't use it as Ni80 works fine for me in DW mode.
They're prewrapped and I got them from AliExpress
yeah uh don't buy your coils/wire from AliExpress.  This may infact be the root if your problem.  A 25ft roll of 24g is about 4 bucks.  Wrapping it around a screwdriver 5-6 times is super simple.
Alright dude! Thanks for the advice!!
I've bought several boxes of premade coils from Ali no complaints so far and I payed like 1 euro for 10 fused claptons.
