Original Response:
I can't decide if this is hubris leading to the fall or some four dimension chess that will put him further in the lead.  Either way, time to get the popcorn out.
Further in the lead of whom?
Further ahead than he would have been by taking the settlement offered.
That remains to be seen. What he did harmed his shareholders. He artificially pumped up his stock on social media for the world to see.
You generally don't get very far ahead by pissing off the SEC.
The guess I heard online that made the most sense to me was that the settlement was a token fine and also a requirement that Musk step down. Tesla agreed and then Musk personally was able to kill the deal.
He is playing 4D chess if he raises prices for the DoD and/or NASA when launching all their stuff into space. SpaceX is 2 to 3 times less expensive than ULA and has a good chance at being real cheap compared to the SLS. SpaceX can raise prices and still maintain a competitive price advantage. Heck if he is crazy as people are insinuating, he maybe even sells all his shares of SpaceX, moves to Europe/China/Russia, starts up a shop there and directly competes with USA for a Space Race 2.0. All to get back at the SEC.
The terms are more or less out there. The SEC wanted a nominal fine, Musk to be barred from being the chairman for two years, and Tesla to appoint two new independent board members. 

Elon would have still been allowed to run the company, just only as CEO instead of being both Chairman of the Board and CEO.
That's a fantastic deal. Why the fuck would anyone walk away from that?

It reminds me of two of the dumbest business calls in the last decade. First, when Google offered $6 billion to buy Groupon. Second, when Groupon said no.
despite being brilliant in some ways Musk seems completely incompetent in other ways

I think he severly underestimates the ramifications of SEC sanctions
Well, for as much as we publicly know about Musk, he isn't a self taught lawyer or legal expert.

To add to that, dude's only got a degree in physics which never qualified him as an engineer in my eyes to begin with.
He promised never to give up control of the board after he lost power with paypal.  Two new board seats and a new chairman would make it more likely they would kick him out.  Heck, apple kicked out steve jobs, boards are not the smartest groups.
He lost power with PayPal because he wouldn't let go of the idea of renaming the company X.com.

The entire purpose of a board is to preserve shareholder value, not coddle the CEO. If Elon was honest with himself, he would be thankful that the PayPal board removed him. The seed money for SpaceX and his Tesla investment (his PayPal shares) was protected from his own reckless impulses by the board.
The board kicked Jobs out when Jobs insisted on a product that at the time was a blunder and expensive.

Even Jobs admitted that leaving Apple was one of the best things that ever happened to him.

Like Elon, Jobs hubris catched up to him at certain point.
Yeah, the mistake Apple made wasn't that they let go of Jobs, it was that they didn't find the right person to replace him.

Long term it all worked out for Apple but one can't count on an outcome like that.
&gt;Why the fuck would anyone walk away from that?

Hubris
SEC is now seeking to have him forever barred from running a public company. Private investors do not lend SpaceX kind of money if the idea of ever going public in a big payout is removed from the equation. Not taking the SEC deal is actually putting SpaceX’s future at risk as well as Tesla’s.
I did wonder if he got the share price down far enough, he could just take the company private, as he wanted to do originally, and tell the SEC to go hang.
&gt; That's a fantastic deal. 

It's a terrible deal. Elon wants away from the bullshit of the stock market. If there is a chairman that can sack him then sooner or later the shareholders/SEC/etc. will come gunning for him, and he loses what practically speaking he built up.
The joke's on everyone - Musk was actually wearing the spacesuit on that Tesla that he sent out into the solar system, and the Musk we've been seeing since then is just a highly-advanced animatronic.
Musks strengths are his long term thinking. Boards think about short term gains. He wants to prevent the board from diluting the long term goal.
“Just because you’re smart doesn’t mean you have common sense” -someone probably, if not me.
Arrogance.
So hes dead?
How many orbital rockets have you designed? How many electric cars? Oh, is it none? I'll bet it's none. 

Tell us again how the guy designing rockets and electric cars and tunnel boring machines isn't an engineer? because of a piece of paper that has the wrong word on it?
How would I know? I didn't get to ride in the Tesla with him :-p
Do you write Hollywood scripts?
&gt; Musks strengths are his long term thinking.

Committing fraud via tweet is a real clever long-term plan
because he hires people and pays them money to do it? or do think Tesla is just Elon Musk in a garage with a 3D printer?
Mishaps happen. It wasn’t fraud. He didn’t intend to defraud people.
&gt;Musk reportedly said that by settling he would be failing to be true to himself.

"be true to yourself": advice that has probably never been uttered by a competent defense attorney.
That advice is only given by hairdressers with “Believe” tattoos.
*Beleive
So like, ‘When keepin it real goes wrong’
Did you bother to read any further?

&gt;However, the settlement would have barred Musk as chairman for two years and would require Tesla to appoint two new independent directors, CNBC's David Faber, citing sources.

If you were Musk would you agree to that?
Yes because he's clearly going to lose the case and the judgment against him will be worse.
Elon on that kanye level thinking right now
If I were Musk then I guess I would do what Musk did, but if I were myself in Musk's position, and my attorneys agreed with the general opinion that the SEC had a solid case against me, then I'd probably take the deal, get a little sleep, and focus on SpaceX for a while. It's not like there's insufficient challenge in getting the BFR to market.

Edit: I just read the deal would have let him stay as CEO, just step down as chairman. That really doesn't sound so bad.
indeed, only going to get worse
We will see.

Well, what are the alternatives? Look at the facts: Musk went *way* out on a limb with that tweet, and it clearly had an effect on the stock price. It's pretty obvious he did not have "funding secured" because he had only come up with a price in his own fucking mind, without any actual guidance from the people who *might* have funding whether $420 would make sense to *them.*

The SEC is obviously going to be offering a penalty that is less than the worst outcome for Musk in a trial, to entice him to take it. The only way to get a better outcome is going to be to blow up their case in pre-trial motions or at trial.

That's a judgement you have to make by thinking about the facts as they are likely to come out. "I think the government has a weak case/misconstrued the evidence/clearly overstepped/whatever and we will prevail at trial." I.e., we have another take on the facts that will result in a not guilty verdict.

Not some mystical "I must be true to myself" or "I have to fight or I will look like a chicken". The government doesn't give a fuck. They will crush you either way.
I mean he did the crime. He totally fabricated a fictitious buyout with a fake valuation that caused a price spike of a stock that he owns a ton of and has insider insights about. It's more textbook than a textbook example would ever dare to be. This is the epitome of an open and shut case.
Chairman != CEO. Chairman is head of the board of directors (who are supposed to be accountable to the shareholders), and a CEO is accountable to the board. Musk is both chairman and CEO.

As far as I can tell he would have been allowed to remain as CEO.
“This isn’t the Vernon I know.”
He’s literally pulling the wolf of Wall Street where he backs out of his deal last second Andover ruin his life.
A D&amp;O order could force him out from being the CEO of any public company. I don't see how this is worse than that. I would only turn down a settlement offer if I could win at trial.
Yes because that’s a great deal. He could potentially be barred from being the CEO of any public company from this.
It's a bit strong to say he fabricated a fictitious buyout. Maybe he had talked to some Middle Eastern entity about taking Tesla private (though it also apparently involved a facility in the Middle East.) These people might even have had the money to do it. What they almost certainly did *not* have was an agreement that a price of $420 (pulled out of Elon's ass) was a reasonable deal. I think that is an important condition Musk failed to mention.

Chairman has the real power though....
More like keeping it real stupid
Granny NO!

Feds have above 95% conviction or plea deal. If you are innocent then are not assured of winning. Elon is guilty. He admits he sent the message. Case is a lock for conviction. The only way he wins is to die during appeal as did the Enron felon. If die during appeal, charges evaporate along with punitive financial judgements. So, Elon is stupid or suicidal. Only choices.
He still owns what, 30% of the shares? So he would sit on the board and could use his voting power?
Elon Musk decided to "keep it real."
Both bipolar, but Kanye’s getting treatment to make it his superpower.
A price of 420 was not pulled from his ass, but the trees.  Only thing more juvenile, $420.69
I would hope that the CEO of a publicly traded company would understand that announcing agreements that don't exist yet is the literal definition of fraud

Summary:
Musk is both chairman and CEO.
If you were Musk would you agree to that?
I don't see how this is worse than that.
Musks strengths are his long term thinking.
The terms are more or less out there.
