It actually tastes way better than the meat one. I've been eating there way more often since it came out.
Todayâ€™s the day
Any day now!
Username checks out.
I was skeptical when I tried it but it was actually quite good. Tasted and felt like meat. I would definitely order again.

This is different but their frozen vegetarian sliders aren't good, unfortunately.  Nasty imo.  I haven't tried this new one they're talking about though.
Itâ€™s called Incredible Burger. They have it at Wallburgers too.  Delish!!!
Impossible Burger. Weâ€™ve had it in Chicago for a while now and itâ€™s really good!!!
I really don't get why people say comments like this about a vegan burger. Comments like that make it seem you're eating a bug lol. It's just smashed beans with some spice in it.
Freezing and defrosting vegan burgers can get the taste out of it easier than in a meat one.
bareburger has it too
I've had it a few times at White Castle and elsewhere. As a lifelong vegetarian, i dont have regular burgers to compare it to, but it's definitely very different than any other veggie burger I've had before, and i don't mind it.
Because most vegetarian burgers taste like bean paste with some spices in it, not a real burger.
Yes Impossible!!!!
Red alert, folks. Intruder alert.

"Delish" is a vegetarian term meaning, "I didn't want to immediately vomit."
Only thing that bums me out is that these sliders are like 300+ cals.
I love these sliders but I can eat 4 easily and theyâ€™re like 300+ cals each. ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
