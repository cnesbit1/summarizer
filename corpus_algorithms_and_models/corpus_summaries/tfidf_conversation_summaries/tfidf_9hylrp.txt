Original Response:
Hi, so recently the a few new people joined our guild and I found a bunch of old guides to help them progress through different aspects of the game, one of them being gearing.

&amp;#x200B;

I got reminded of properly the easiest way to get an ascended weapon, all it requires is:

* Completed HOT story
* Vision Crystal. (this is the tricky part, as some pointed out you need either 500 crafting to craft one of these or get lucky from drops or salving ascended gear)
* You get a Vision Crystal from the final login reward: [Chest of Ascended Crafting Materials](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Ascended_Crafting_Materials) from the [Chest of Loyalty](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Loyalty).
* Broken Caladbolg (Gotten from the last mission of HOT, if thrown out can be reclaimed from Miyani at the Mystic Forge)

How this is done is through the Side Story  [Knight of the Thorn](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn) where at the end you get a choice between the below ascended weapons

* [Caladbolg Orchida](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Orchida) (greatsword)
* [Caladbolg Astera](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Astera) (shield)
* [Caladbolg Iridi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Iridi) (scepter)
* [Caladbolg Rosa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Rosa) (sword)
* [Caladbolg Solana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Caladbolg_Solana) (dagger)

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the Dulfy's guide on how to acquired the almost free Ascended weapon.

# Specialization Collections

Another way as some have pointed out is doing the PoF specialization collections, which have a cost of around 20-40g depending on which one it is. they are limited in the same way as the above in that not all weapon types are available.

Requirements for these are:

* Unlock the elite specialization to start the collection (requires you to finish the elite specialization for the collection)
* Time waiting for events
* PoF expansion

You can get one of the Exotic for the below collections by doing this collection which costs 1-2g

&amp;#x200B;

And last but not least is the HoT collections, these can be a bit more grindy than the PoF as you have to do some meta's in the different maps to get map currency to buy parts for the weapons.

&amp;#x200B;

Requirements for these are:

* Unlock the elite specialization to start the collection (requires you to finish the elite specialization for the collection)
* Time waiting for events
* Farming Meta's
* HoT expansion

Edit 8: Added better description on how to acquire Specialization weapons
Yea PoF collections are by far the easiest/quickest I feel like. Doable in 2-4 hours each.
Yep they are a total cakewalk compared to the Grind of Thorns collections.  I'm tempted to buy a character slot just for the sake of getting all 9 of them.
Why would you do that when in 4 hrs you can pretty reliably farm up enough gold to craft an ascended even without the costs of those achievements
You have to get crafting to 500 as well, that's an added cost...
The recipes take longer than the gold
Personally, doing a collection is far more enjoyable than farming gold for a few hours.
cant you buy the recipes for a couple of laurels each?
Yeah but if you’re going for these collections because you have no ascended weapons you probably haven’t been playing for long enough to accrue enough laurels for all weapons and armor if you take into account spending laurels on an ascended accessory (amulet?) costing 20-30 laurels based on where you buy it from. I say this because I’m in the exact same boat waiting for drops or laurels to gear for higher end fractals lol
buying trinkets with laurels is the worst thing you can do with them. use your laurels strictly for ascended recipes or t6 mats

and i disagree with that comment about playtime. someone who plays for 50 hours every few months since launch could have acquired 500h+ of gameplay and totally not have ascended gear, outside of trinkets maybe
Yes because you are never going to get crafting to 500 ever because all you need is one ascended weapon for all your characters?
But the point of this is to get one for new players
What's the point of getting them one ascended weapon? The whole point is to set things up for a new player so that they can acquire a a set of ascended gear and armour. The chances are, they will likely take 500 crafting for at least armour, and probably for weapons as well anyway. Assuming that is the case, it makes virtually no difference in the long run.
If they never do fractals, sure
One of the collection parts that keeps getting stuck for me is throwing the mystic coin into the fountain in Vabbi. I just never have the option to do it on any of my toons, even tried having the mystic coins in my bags instead of the bank, dunno wtf is up with that but it's one of the last two I need for my deadeye rifle and herald shield.
Also some of the collections crossove; since engineer and elementalist both gained access to the sword With PoF elite specs, their collections both include the same exotic sword (Libeh's Truthteller or something like that) so if you're running a Sw/Sw class then that's two ascendeds in a similar time frame :D
Yes they are BUT you need to:

- have the right class at level 80
- get enough HPs to finish the elite spec
- have enough map completion to get where you need to go
- get the right events (waiting game)

Some things to take onboard when you’re talking about how quick the PoF collections are. Comparatively you need 500 crafting on any character and finish HoT to do the Caladbolg collection.

You probably still come out ahead with the PoF collections but the 2-4hr estimate ignores the above stuff.
If you want to be like that, it makes virtually no difference if they gear up to ascended in the first place
Some people just want to hand out free fish.
Ascended gear makes a significant difference. I am talking about the fact that players will need to get a SET of ascended gear, and to get such a set, that player will need to craft anyway, meaning that the relative costs in terms of time of crafting an ascended weapon by gold vs by this awfully tedious achievement is the same, if not worse.
That’s weird. I’ve always just taken one coin out of my mat storage, then gone up to the well and it works
Same problem here.

Also, the Herald Shield comes from a HoT collection, no need to throw a coin :)
i dont think you know what a grind is
Just me misremembering the weapon it's for, all the same the toons I've tried it on none have had an option to toss a mystic coin in.
Sure you're checking the right fountain?

Sure you're not hitting "deposit all" before getting to the fountain?
Grind of thorns. The true name of that ego pack
What coins does it let you throw into the fountain?

If you can't throw any coins into the fountain, then you're at the wrong fountain.  The fountain in question should normally prompt you to choose between copper, silver and gold, even if you're not carrying any Mystic Coins.
Is it really? HoT is only a grind for the first few, since there are some elite specs that share a weapon, those collections are done in an hour or less. 


Also the gold you have to spend ends up being less overall than PoF, since there are shared weapons and such. My Druid and Chrono collection were a cakewalk after I was done with Daredevil and Rev. 


The only thing "grindy" is the currencies you have to farm but you get enough of it doing other collections and achievements in general.
It let's me choose between copper silver and gold, tried each of those as well.
Yup at the right fountain, even compared to YouTube videos of people doing it, tried all the coin options as well, and I used the mobile bank to withdraw a stack of mystic coins and even just a single mystic coin in my bag before.
How do you feel about quest hub grind?
Is the Mystic Coin in an Invisible Bag in your inventory? I seem to recall that messing with NPC-based interactions.
as an old school mmo player, to me a grind is getting a group together, spending 30mins to an hour to find a camp spot. having a puller pull mobs, and killing the mobs for hours and hours for minute rewards. thats a grind. Quest hub grind? Depends on how you look at it. Are you talking about the WoW model?
Yet the entire point of OP is to get a new player directly to an ascended weapon ASAP.

Stop moving the goal post and you see the difference between your argument and the idea behind this thread.
[deleted]
Nope all I have are crafted 20 slot bags and wvw bags
Are you using special bags that dont show items to vendors, etc?

That could screw the coin throw interface.
The WoW model, yes.
Crafted Bags can be invisibles, but I think I get what you mean with them being normal bags. Next thing that comes to mind is asking if you've already thrown a Mystic Coin into the wishing well with that particular class. Or, if you have more than one in your stack of coins, try pulling a single coin from the stack. Or maybe even banking the rest and just keep one.  
There could be any number of things messing this up, but I'm less inclined to think the interaction itself just isn't available. Something else must be messing it up.
Uhh, 2-4 hrs? Not a chance.
[deleted]
Depends. If you get immersed in the world they can add great flavor and lore and enjoyment. It is an outdated model by today's standards but back in 2004 it was awesome.
So it's okay to call it grind?
Don't spend your laurels for an amulet if you are low. You can make [Vial of Salt](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Salt) for ~18g. That's if you don't have access to LW maps, since you can get one for free there.
Since the guide is for new players, I'd wager that it's a lot quicker to farm the gold for the named exotics than it is to grind the Mastery points and experience for the vendor unlocks needed for HOT weapons.  POF mastery points come way faster, and the hero points are all much easier.
Not by my definition, no. A grind is doing literally the exact same thing for hours for little reward. WoW's model is not necessarily a grind. It adds story, lore, variation to the original camp and kill design of original MMO games. GW2 improves upon that with its dynamic event system, further displacing its model from anything grindy. I have not once grinded in gw2 and im approaching 25k achievement points. People don't use the word correctly in my opinion. If something is boring to you that's one thing, but to label anything that causes subjective boredom as a grind is not fair or accurate.
PoF was just exceptionally undertuned. ANet took their long term reward system with PoF, and made the experience to complete literally all masteries be obtainable in 3 hours. Great way to make your new content abandoned within 2 weeks, which is exactly what happened to almost all of PoF. There's a reason HoT is still this active after such a long time.
invisible bag doesn't make a difference. I always kept the coin in invis bag so that I wouldn't deposit it out of habit and I could still use it in the well.
Although PoF collections mainly became an option thanks to Istan crashing the prices on the exotics needed otherwise the collections used to cost more than crafting the weapons.
How does that compare to gaining 1% of your level in a month and a single death will wipe that all away?
Hm the HoT HPs are so overrated. 


No joke, I was playing on my Ranger, crappy build (the one you get with the lvl 80 booster) and I put a tag up, posted on lfg smth like (Mini HP run come help me) and I gathered 5-6 people and completed all HPs on AB :3 


It's a thing I love about HoT .. the forced interaction you must have with other players .. PoF you solo everything auto attacking :3 

But yes for new players I suppose PoF will always be better. 


I was just making a note for anyone reading this and is into gathering as much weapons and achievs as possible.
That's not bad, not all players wanted another HoT, though I assume the next expansion (whenever it happens) will be more repeatable in nature because PoF is now established as pretty good entry level endgame content
[removed]
So your beef is with the entire genre if your definition is that broad. Maybe single player games like Divinity original sin or semi online games like monster hunter is more your style
This is the real crux, not accidentally hitting deposit all while on your way to the fountain.
It doesn't compare at all. It's completely different from what is being talked about.
My beef with the genre is unknown to you as is my defintion of the term "grind". Same goes to what games may or may not be my style.  I've been asking you if you can work with changing language.
Only if terms are defined appropriately
And the appropriate definition is that from twenty years ago? Correct?
True, but I for example wanted an Ascended Dagger for my Thief. The quickest way for me was to level a Warrior to 80, max out his Spellbreaker specialization and meanwhile finish the collection achievement. I think all this took me about 8 hours in total. Same for the sword on my Holosmith.

If you know only slightly what you're doing and it's not the very first collection achievement you're finishing up on, it's all very easily doable in half a day of playtime.

Like, I haven't done any of the HoT collections, I have never owned an Ascended equipment piece (armor/weapon) except for the PoF collection (weapon/backpack) ones. I haven't done any real end-game stuff really.

Still, even for me, it was so easy to get my Ascended weapons through this method.

Not saying it's too easy, I thought it was great to finally have some Ascended pieces, but comparatively easy yes.
A million different people complained about masteries taking too long in HoT. So whose fault is it really in this case :thinking:
Gatekeeping?

Summary:
What's the point of getting them one ascended weapon?
But the point of this is to get one for new players.
You have to get crafting to 500 as well, that's an added cost...
Also, the Herald Shield comes from a HoT collection, no need to throw a coin :)
Comparatively you need 500 crafting on any character and finish HoT to do the Caladbolg collection.
Yes because you are never going to get crafting to 500 ever because all you need is one ascended weapon for all your characters?
HoT is only a grind for the first few, since there are some elite specs that share a weapon, those collections are done in an hour or less.
