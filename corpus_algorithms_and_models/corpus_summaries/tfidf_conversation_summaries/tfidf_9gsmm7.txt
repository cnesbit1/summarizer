Subreddits dedicated to trump/Q have been getting banned, and it seems like they're all funneling here. Is this organic or is this something to be concerned about? Could /r/Conspiracy get banned due to this recent influx of politically biased posts? I've also been seeing a lot of things being upvoted like crazy that normally wouldn't be here (at least in my opinion)
I agree. Q is so obviously bullshit. If he wasn't, something would've happened by now. And I noticed an increase in Q posts. I do wonder if you're correct that they want us banned.
FISA just got declassified. We’ve heard about that forever from Q. Also, anons recently asked Q to post to 8chan at the same time as a Trump tweet. And it happened an hour later!  The exact same minute. Just more evidence that has been piling up. https://imgur.com/gallery/UW2mxLH
So Pamphlet’s team were ready to fire off a tweet as soon as they see one from POTUS???  Does this “proof” make you suspicious because “proof” is supposed be substantial. Even his Xmas pics from the WH are suspicious.
😂
And it’s just a coincidence that Q said the MOAB would come linked to a red carpet event. Emmys were last night, same as FISA DECLAS. There are hundreds of these ‘coincidences’ but you are welcome to not believe.
The one time he tries to post “proof” that he’s tied to the WH was when he faked a pic from AF1. Was that a coincidence too?
It wasn’t faked, and there was a much deeper riddle to that pic.
Riddles are all I hear about this Q group, which is the most telling part. If you haven’t figured out how fake this is, there’s nothing I can say to convince you. Step back and take an objective view is the monetized movement called Q.
Can’t convince me at this point. History being made. Once Kavanaugh is confirmed i think the show really gets going. Exciting times.
Yeah, I’ve been hearing that shit since the military helicopters took over DC last year. You’re just banging your head against a wall. Hillary and co were supposed to be on a Cuban vacation about 20,000 times by now huh?

Yes, history is being made...while Pam makes $$$$ off the Q movement. They’re right—follow the money!!

Summary:
And I noticed an increase in Q posts.
