Please check the [previous discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9jlcr8/daily_discussion_september_28_2018/) for unanswered questions.
It's positive to see so many large organizations biting at each others heals to go down in history to be the first to secure an approved bitcoin investment product, because it means that it's almost inevitable that one will eventually get the green light. But it also seems orchestrated that starting at the end of each year everything starts looking positive in news articles, almost as though MSM purposely shifts public sentiment. Coincidence? Oh well, either way, it's looking like a run up is incoming, and I'll take it lol.
"so many large organizations biting at each others"?  Sure :)

Couple of months ago, some level of interest.  Now, nobody even talks about it anymore.
Yet here you are, talking about it.  On a platform designed to talk about it! So you basically just destroyed all credibility in your own argument with your hypocrisy. You should run for politics lol.
It's now just a cottage industry and this is the hangout.  But that's all it is now.

Most of the people here are just hoping for a price bump to cut their losses and get out.
So thought folks in 2015 and so may you think. And so may I accumulate by buying from those who think so...
Sure.  But maybe you should just wait a while more.

There's no stimulus to break out of this price band so sooner or later, the price is going to go down further (unless something interesting happens).

I don't claim to predict short term movements either way. But I prefer to accumulate by buying a fixed fiat amount worth everyday. So I don't need to think about stimulus or dips.

Bullshit.

How often were you dropped on your head as a baby?  

Are you sure someone wasn't dropping you deliberately :)
That explains why you're here. Doesn't explain why you're so clueless.

But that is just nonsense - and you know it.
Have you ever attempted a coherent sentence?  Give it a try.

I don't think he does. It seems he has little awareness of the developments coming down the pipe and also no grasp of just how many people are active in this space. It's not like we're going to school him, he needs to want to learn and he seems far more content in his ignorance than most.

It isn't nonsense because that is precisely what is happening.

But go ahead and believe whatever you want.
Seems like either I'm clueless or you are in denial of the obvious.

BTC and cryptos have gone past the hype cycle and now declining to being irrelevant.
Hope so, at least then we would have an explanation.
