Original Response:
Max Holloway is expected to defend his 145 title against Brian Ortega at UFC 231 on December 8. It will come 1 year and 6 days after his last fight and first title defense against Jose Aldo at UFC 218 on December 2, 2017. 

Since then he was expected to defend against Frankie Edgar at UFC 222 on March 3, pulled out a month earlier due to a foot injury. He got called to fight Khabib for the 155 belt on a 1 week notice at UFC 223 on April 7, but he couldn’t make weight. And lastly he was scheduled to defend against Brian Ortega at UFC 226 on July 4, but pulled out due to ‘concussion like symptoms’.

If MMA Gods forbid Max cannot make it to the fight on UFC 231, which is honestly not a 0% possibility especially that it’s still not clear what was wrong the last time, do you think the UFC should strip his title? With all the love to Max i think it would be the right call, and let Brian fight for the vacant belt against an Aldo/Moicano/Mendes...
Yes, I do.   


That would be 3 title fights booked where he was required to defend his title.

He pulled out of 222 and 226, 231 would be 3 pullouts.
How so? UFC 222, UFC 226 and then UFC 231? It's not including his late replacement bout with Khabib at UFC 223.
Oh sorry I for whatever reason wasn’t counting 231 with my dumb brain. I’ll delete my comment now sorry.
Nah you're good!

Nonono, you're doing reddit all wrong!

You're supposed to double down on your innocent mistake and claim that you were right all along, check back a few hours later, do an edit to complain about downvotes and then start flinging random insults at the people who pointed out you were wrong
I’ve never seen this sub summarized as well as this comment right here.
And an additional fight at 155 he couldnt make - not relevant to his 145 title, but it does display his issues are even more significant, which warrants a closer look at stripping
Are you fucking sorry?!
Ah the virtuous life.

Summary:
UFC 222, UFC 226 and then UFC 231?
He pulled out of 222 and 226, 231 would be 3 pullouts.
