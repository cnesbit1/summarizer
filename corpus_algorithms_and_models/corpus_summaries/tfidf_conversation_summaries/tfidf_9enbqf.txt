I know most people here probably hate The Donald, but I want to give some kudos to them regardless. Say what you want, but Trump made a lot of people **question the narrative** which in my view is an incredible achievement. Just how much he moved in this regard struck me when a popular MSM host, Tucker Carlson, was allowed to bring a whole piece about the last [staged attack in Douma](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cSGf2ZpDENU)

Imagine if someone did that on CNN, MSNBC, CNSBC and how they're all called.

I see the accustions already flying and no, Im no Donald Trump shill. Im neither left nor right. Im just observing, making my own conclusions and I see potential in some of Trumps actions.
You contribute to T_D an awful lot for someone who isn’t a Trump supporter
*"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."* - Aristotle
Give me a fucking break. It is literally the Donald Trump propaganda dissemination subreddit. 

Trump cultists have been trying so hard to play this “both sides” bullshit for the past 2 years, trying to make their own viewpoints actually seem legitimate or equal to rational thinking.

“Yeah guys, I’m totally actually a centrist! I just happen to hate the libruls and post Trump memes in The_Donald...”
So you can't entertain a thought you don't agree with? Nice seeing how your mind works u/NeoBey
I’m not sure why you’re trying to conflate “entertaining a thought” with actively participating and contributing to spreading and upholding those thoughts and ideas. 


Furthermore, you’d be an idiot to “entertain a thought” in every single scenario, especially when someone is being misleading or deceptive. You posit that all thoughts and ideas are on equal footing.

There's a big difference between hypothesis, thoughts, theories and *political opinions*. But you don't know that, it's either BLUE or RED. Killary is innocent, but Trump must die in prison because CNN told me so! Never have a debate, always try to shut them up before arguments happen.
Now you’re just babbling.
&gt;Now you’re just babbling.

Amazing argument. Great read. Important topics being discussed. Nice debating skills. Yeah.
What debate? LMAO 

You’re in here rambling about Hillary Clinton and CNN, apropos to nothing, like some kind of lunatic.
Ah, projection.
How about you just look at the CONTENT I pointed out instead of giving me shit over fucking memes?
You can disagree with a side but still appreciate certain viewpoints of them.
But oh no, I get it, it's either or, black or white, there are no grey areas.
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Yup, but it's the mark of a follower to be able to comment in T_D and not be immediately banned.
I like how you mentioned his user name so if he winds up deleting his comment we'll all know who it was.  Excellent work there, u/supranational_stoner.  
  
FYI, I almost exclusively listen to conservative talk radio when I'm in the car.  I find it helpful to know in advance what every single one of my conservative co-workers will be parroting later.  I have no problem with entertaining thoughts I don't agree with.  However, what happens over in T_D isn't "thinking".
Everyone needs to have a look at this comment chain and accept the fact that, contrary to popular belief, people like this are completely self-aware.  They have to be aware of exactly what they're doing to be able to project this accurately.
&gt;what happens over in T_D isn't "thinking".

I agree, but doesn't mean that OP is like that - as he stated.

Summary:
You posit that all thoughts and ideas are on equal footing.
