Enjoy the fights! Get HYPE!
Most dominant WMMA performance of all time? 

Edit: it was 80-0 in terms of significant strikes. Other than maybe Shev Cachoeira that has to be
Nunez v Ronda.
JJ vs Carla?
Andrade vs Claudia comes to mind
Are you new here? Forget about JJ and Ronda?
JJ piecing up jessica penne comes to mind. but yeah pretty damn close
Joanna vs Carla? I feel bad for Carla now :(
Maybe not as dominant as Ronda Rousey tapping out Cat Zingano in thirteen seconds.
Holly over Ronda was pretty fucking conclusive and Nunes was over in 48 seconds. That being said Mrs Smesh is a fucking force. Struggling to see Rose or JJ stopping those takedowns.
At least Ronda hit Nunes once
At least Carla hit Joanna once
They both hit their opponent
That is a good point.
Just saw the sig. strike stat. That's crazy.

Wut
What? Do you mean Nate?
Lol at the people downvoting you. You're right
Can't even name the correct brother. If you're gonna try and talk shit, at least get the names right.
How is he right lol
Conor had two years to defend a belt and instead went to play with Mayweather
And now he is fighting against who ?
It took him two damn years and he isn't walking in as champion. He never defended a belt despite being healthy

Summary:
At least Ronda hit Nunes once.
At least Carla hit Joanna once.
Forget about JJ and Ronda?
