Original Response:
Also, what was the coverage like in comparison? How did this effect erosion in different areas? For that matter, what about before land plants entirely? Did erosive forces act faster?
I'm not the best suited to give an in-depth explanation, but I would note that angiosperms as a whole are relatively recent in the evolutionary timeline of plants, which have been around for about 480 million years.

The first flowering plants diverged from gymnosperms about 200-250 mya, and angiosperms became widespread about 120 mya (so about the last quarter of the entire existence of the plant kingdom).

Poaceae (the family that contains grasses) was originally thought to be around 55 million years old, but older fossil evidence keeps turning up. Plant structures associated with grasses have been found in fossilized dinosuar feces dating back to 66 mya, and revised dating of the rice tribe and fossil evidence of mammals with apparent grass-feeding adaptations have pushed the origins of Poaceae back to around 100-120 mya, about the same time that flowering plants became widespread.

As far as the make-up and distribution of plant communities prior to the emergence of grasses/grasslands/angiosperms in general I really don't know. Nor do I know much about erosion and soil formation at the time plants first began to colonize land.
Thinking like a 5 year old, I was hoping for more of an answer like:

"Dirt."

This is correct, but I feel needs to be added to: there is an important difference between the evolution of grass and the emergence of the grassland. It took grass a while before it was truly defining it's own biome. Last I heard was around 25 mya, but that may have been since updated.
Even before plants dominated the landscape, fungi (lichens) was quite capable of overtaking land. It is unlikely that dirt was all that existed.
Definitely an important point, thanks.

"Here's a rundown of plant evolution. Oh sorry, I don't know the answer to your question."
My main point (which admittedly I didn't make that clear) was simply that one premise of his question (grasses are recently evolved) is questionable/vague.

That’s all correct (with the caveat that others have mentioned of *grasslands* being a more recent phenomenon and a different thing than the emergence of grasses themselves).

Ground-covers in the Cretaceous and earlier appear to have largely been ferns, mosses (true mosses and club-mosses), and biocrusts (mixtures of lichens, algae, liverworts, and mosses).  Given the relatively early dates of flowering plants there were undoubtedly some forbs mixed in as well, but not in significantly highe enough densities to leave a strong fossil record.  It would not be surprising if there were some small, ground-cover adapts confiers or conifer relatives, but I’ve never read of those being found.  In more damp areas horsetails would be common as well.

Ferns, once established, can be extremely tenacious (as are horsetails) due to their rhizomatous growth (a network of tough underground stems from which new plants can grow even if they are broken).

Picture [a landscape like this one](https://www.flickr.com/photos/7leagueboots/4918049904/in/album-72157624784344336/), but with the trees replaced with conifers instead, or the sword fern and redwood/Douglas fir forests of the Pacific Northwest (at least for wet areas).
Not to sidetrack the discussion, but how do ferns manage to exclude other plants in an environment like that? I often am in very open woodlands, with only mature trees and fern groundcover, but not real understory. It seems like it wouldn't take long for something to grow through the ferns following a disturbance, unless they use some sort of allelopathy.

I suspect it depends a lot on the type of fern, but where I took that photo (Appalachian Trail in Shenandoah NP, Virginia) and elsewhere along the East Coast the lack of apex predators and the resulting [overpopulation of white-tailed deer seems to a major driving force](https://extension.psu.edu/controlling-understory-fern-competition-for-regeneration-success).

Many types of fern (and things like hobble-bush) are not preferred forage for the deer.  They selectively eat what they like, leaving the plants they don't, which gives those plants, ferns especially, enjoy a competitive advantage as a result.  Hay-scented fern is one of the ones that's often considered a "problem" fern in that part of the US.

On the West Coast it's a bit different, the old-growth tall forests are dark which limits what can grow in the understory.  Certain ferns tolerate the dark well and grow so densely that they effectively drown out other plants.  Not all others, obviously, but enough so that they dominate.

Situations like this are why the occasional blow-down is so important in old, primary growth forests.  Blow-downs open up the forest to light and promote the growth of important species that have been sort of "waiting in the wings" for the opportunity to grow.

[Allelopathy, of a more chemical nature, also plays a part, particularly in the case of bracken ferns](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226278266_The_allelopathic_mechanisms_of_dominance_in_bracken_Pteridium_aquilinum_in_Southern_California) and studies have been done on a wide variety of other ferns, indicating that this is a trait that is widespread.  Of course, it's a mix of factors that leads to suppression of other plants, in the linked paper one of the findings was that small animals sheltering in bracken fern stands foraged on seedlings and suppressed the growth of certain plants as a result.

Like a lot of things, the full answer is complex.
I’ve actually been working on a review of the literature on allelopathy. It’s generally a mess involving really poor controls and a general lack of critical thinking, but I don’t think we’ve swept up this paper yet, looks promising.
In the [quick search I did for allelopathy in ferns](https://www.google.com.vn/search?q=fern+allelopathy&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enVN793VN793&amp;oq=fern+allelopathy&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0.4847j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) I ran across a lot of papers.  Many of them are older ones though, so the state of knowledge has undoubtedly changed and expanded since then.  There are also a decent amount of more recent papers too though.

Thanks! That's great. I'm on the east, so it's mainly the hay scented fern dominated forests I'm seeing. Your answer helped steer my search, so I found a decent, rather [generally accessible writeup on how/why these forests develop in PA](https://extension.psu.edu/controlling-understory-fern-competition-for-regeneration-success).
Haha, that’s the same article I included in the first link.
Was just looking at Wikipedia, it seems grasses were mostly growing in water-adjacent areas like riverbanks until the Oligocene. /u/bigfatcarp93
How much dirt was there millions of years ago? How much was just bare rock?

edit: Found an [interesting read on the history of soil](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20151205-one-amazing-substance-allowed-life-to-thrive-on-land)

&gt; By about 360 million years ago, soils were much like they are today, with the same range of varieties we can find beneath our feet – including swamp soils and forest soils.

Summary:
How much dirt was there millions of years ago?
Poaceae (the family that contains grasses) was originally thought to be around 55 million years old, but older fossil evidence keeps turning up.
