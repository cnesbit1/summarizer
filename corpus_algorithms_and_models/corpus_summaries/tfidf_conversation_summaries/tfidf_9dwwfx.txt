Original Response:
Stat swapping on legendary weapons is almost useless because you cant change the sigils.

Make it like the legendary armor...

And since people will complain about market crash:

the current rune/sigil system is trash anyway and the sigil lose their value even without swapping
Give ascended gear the same stat swap and sigil/rune swapping QoL as well.

LOL at being downvoted for having a valid request. People don't understand how reddit works, apparently.
nope
It should happen. Legendaries shouldn't have such a huge QoL advantage. Legendaries were supposed to be for the skin anyway.
For ascended gear?  You wanna share what youâ€™re smoking? I think I need some
Nope. Then why would you spend 2-3k gold? For a skin? I'll convert that to gems and get better skins.
That's how it was at launch. Remember when best in slot gear was supposed to be easy to acquire and the cool skins were expensive?
Logicjuana, want some?
Ascended gear has never been easier to acquire than now. Also legendary and ascended are both BiS since they're the same stat values. Stat changing is QoL it does not concern BiS.
Yes, they are the same statwise, but being able to stat swap on the fly out of combat is huge. That is something that should be available to all players, not just ones who have legendary gear.
Then why make legendaries?

The skins in the shop are better.

Everyone could statswap.

For the footfalls? Come on now.
Why make legendaries? Maybe because some people like the skins?  After all, they were supposed to be fancy and unique skins in the first place.

You may think the gem store skins are better, but that's just your opinion. Other players might not agree. And if stat swapping was available to everyone, not just those that had legendary gear, you could stat swap as you please with your gem store skinned gear.
Then it's not very "legendary" is it, to only have a shiny skin for 2-3k gold...

Reduce the price then. But then we get no real "legendary" weapons.
I think you're the one that doesn't understand how reddit works actually
You don't downvote people because you disagree with them. That's exactly what happened. So tell me more about how I don't understand how reddit works.
The downvote button is literally used as a disagree button. It is not supposed to be that way, but of course it is. That is how reddit works. It is like that everywhere.
That's what I said, hence "people not understanding how reddit works."
I think you're confusing 'how I want reddit to work' with 'how reddit actually works'
Hopefully not ever gonna happen. People build legendary armor for exactly that ability to Stat swap and rune swap freely and I'm pretty sure that more than half the people with legendary armor, me included, have some reskin on it. 

Any other MMORPG would've made legendary stats better than any other rarity, Anet took the approach to remove that gear grinding and make legendaries QoL instead. They should in no way remove any of the advantages legendaries have right now for their price...

Go have a look at GW1.

Mechanically top tier weapon with a basic skin: 5 platinum from a merchant (you can get this much money in under an hour). Less from an NPC collector if you trade them some trash drops.

Exclusive skin from a dungeon chest: Many thousands of times that price from another player.

Both these items are mechanically identical, because rarity has nothing to do with stats. This is universally considered a good thing in GW1.

Anet pissed all over the manifesto by releasing ascended and legendary gear as they are right now.
I agree with you. Legendary and Ascended, as they are, is directly opposed to the manifesto and a complete change from GW1 where nobody ever had a problem with rarity being cosmetic only.
Exactly. The players who wanted the additional tier of gear left soon after, but Anet still catered to them anyway.
I hate how bloated the game's systems have become.

Did/do you play GW1?
Yes, and it is one of my favorite games.

That is how reddit works.
Legendaries shouldn't have such a huge QoL advantage.

That is something that should be available to all players, not just ones who have legendary gear.
Maybe because some people like the skins?
