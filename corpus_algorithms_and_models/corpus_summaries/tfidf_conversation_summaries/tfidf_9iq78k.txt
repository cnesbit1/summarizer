Hello im owner of a new bike of benelli
BN 125. 

I Didnt know until I tried , on the highway , the max speed of it is 110 and diying already. 

The rkv 125 from keeway shows 135. My shop local shop told me is amazing machine a new line from benelli factory.. The problem is this bike starts to die around 4/5 gear on 90Â° any ideas? 


Its a new bike with 800km only.
I am not sure whats the brake in period or km for your bike but if without proper break in you are taking it to its paces then u r doing murder of engine
Brake in period? Like speed for each gear?
No, you have to drive it a specific way the first ~2000 km or something. To get the cylinder and piston-rings ready for high rpm's. There are many different opinions on this though. 

To answer your question: 110 km/h seems pretty reasonable. My old 250 XT with double the horse power only did 115 km/t. The CBR 125 with full farings does 110 too. 

On my ol' XT I always just found a nice truck and stayed behind that on the highway - less wind and nice 80 km/h without hammering the engine and gas-consumption. Do that. 

And enjoy you new bike! :)
Im on a almost 1000km of it.

I do everyday Around 90km/h to pass the small highway. Im going also to change the rear escape for a racing one.
Well, okay then. 

The rear what? Escape?
Exhaut pipe
no.its like every engine have a specific speed limit when its new.i have a honda 125 and it had to be no more then 60km/h for first 1500 km as it effects the engine efficiency and integrity in the long run.basically u have to prepare the engine by going step by step.first 40km/h then 60.mine goes to about 115km/h after proper break in period but at that speed it sounds like someones cutting its throat.
Yea okay. Just know that it won't be any faster, only sound a little better :)
Didnt know about that. 

Im almost on 1000km of the engine. Never did go above 100km just in these days but for just some time.

The other times I go at 60km/h
Yep. What I could change to make it faster and dont die at 110?
Nothing really. You can spend 1000 euro and make it go 120-125. Keep the bike as it is and spend some money on good tires, good brakes and gear - that and your skills will make it way fast than any part you can buy.  

An old saying is: "No replacement for displacement" which simply means that nothing really beats a big engine (600-1000 cc). 

125 and 12 HP like yours is good fun though, and really nice to ride around on on the small roads. You don't need to go fast to have fun. I miss my old 1980 XT250 now that I have a Ducati 600 to be honest. 

Here is a perfect example of how big bikes with bad riders are slower than a slow bike with a good rider: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz03sQeX02c

"It's more fun to ride a slow bike fast than a fast bike slow" Definitely true!

Summary:
The other times I go at 60km/h.
Like speed for each gear?
Im almost on 1000km of the engine.
