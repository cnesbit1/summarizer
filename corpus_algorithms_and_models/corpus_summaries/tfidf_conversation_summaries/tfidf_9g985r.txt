TA says that BTC is [due](https://flic.kr/p/2a2UMdd) for a big pump in the next few days to a week. 

((If TA's all bullshit, (and it very well may be), then it sure is a coincidence that basically every move it's made lately matches up with the chart projections.)) 

What's your take?
My take is up to 6800 then back to 6000 one last time, after that around 6k for a month before the next bull run starts. FWIW TA is bullshit if you look on trading view youll see charts predicting everything from revisiting 3-5k to going straight to the moon
These days you have to be really careful with popular TAs. They're traps.

Whales are using the most popular TAs to play their little manipulative games. If a TA chart becomes really popular and gets shared a lot all over social media, and many people start having the same expectation about that TA's prediction, you can be sure some whale out there will use that to their advantage. That's why when you see a really popular TA that everyone talks about, be really careful. Those are the ones that can burn you.
Huh. 
Never thought of it that way. 
Thanks for the warning; that makes a lot of sense.
?  
"FWIW", I didn't mention "prediction charts" one time. 
I was referring ONLY to charts of "things that've already happened," to put it in its simplest terms. 

I *was* asking what others' predictions for the future were, but that's it.  
(And thanks for yours.) 
But you kind of crossed up what I asked.
he's right. most of us know the chart patterns and when something becomes popular whales know where people will be and what they will be thinking. the majority do not expect a move to 10k by the end of the year which is why i think we may have exactly that
Hey how about owning up to your losing bet and paying up, you dishonorable scammer.
