Original Response:
When I was religious I scoffed at spiritual but not religious. But after leaving the Catholic Church Iâ€™m considering it. I still believe in God but no longer think I absolutely have to affix a bunch of rules to my life to be close to it. Now I see a lot of religion as nothing but control even if I see the value religion done has for society in its own ways. As a trans person why should I be religious and not just be spiritual?
