You can’t sway her. Real life is not like the movies. The things they do to win the girl over in those movies will get you arrested.

She’s probably not interested. A 17F will let you know she’s interested by communicating with you all the time.

I’d let it go and find someone who is interested. You’re super young and will definitely date lots of girls if that’s what you want. It’s just not always the girl you’re crushing on the hardest.

Hang in there. I’m old enough to be your dad, but I remember what it’s like to be really into someone at that age. Someone else will come along where you click more naturally, and it will be a beautiful thing.
Why not invite her to a casual video game? Have you tried this before?

I may be too old to give you advice in that arena (44). And it may be my age, but I think actual face time and getting to know someone outside of social media are your best bets. 

And you never want to come across as trying too hard. You want to be cool, confident, and seem interested but not desperate.

Unfortunately, it’s hard to say without knowing the situation and the people involved. I can only speculate if that would make a difference to her or not.

Summary:
