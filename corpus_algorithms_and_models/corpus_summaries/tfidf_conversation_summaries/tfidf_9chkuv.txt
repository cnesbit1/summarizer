Wassup everyone? Man been busy with all of the updates to my post and writing in general. but otherwise it‚Äôs been a solid day. No complaints really on my end. How about y‚Äôall? How‚Äôs it been? Of course I gotta ask if anyone got anything cool for the Labor Day sales lol. 

Vape status: cereal crunch from cloudbery vapor. Also a bit of slotter pop in my Inbox. Man this juice is nasty. The slotter pop I mean. Just way too sweet. Then again, it‚Äôs like the only bottle of 6mg I have I think. Might have something else and I really hope I do. At least there‚Äôs cereal crunch in my siren to save me!

Beer status: pacific punch from decadent ales. Too sweet but good all the same.

Writing status: 4.5 is fine. Working on episode 5 now. Also reviews and other things. 

Mama2013 status: way better than a week ago but still a little ways off from 100%.
Picked up a blue aluminum dreamer. 56 bucks was too good of a deal to pass up and I have an orion's belt csmnt and blue tm24 pro that is going to match very nice on it. 

Your MTL post motivated me to build the siren 2, have some beard peach rings salt in it, otherwise its more bananas foster in the phenom on the vtinbox. The beard salt has been funky in my tanks going black fast but tastes good fresh.
So 4.5 was a nice read! Ep5 betta be your Empire of the Jedi!!

üòÑ

My most exciting acquisition in the sales has to be the Ammit MTL RDA. Looks like airflow similar to the siren, so that'll be fun!
Lol I‚Äôm glad I gotcha to use the siren lol 

The dreamer for $56 sounds like a rad deal dude!
Haha dude it does look like a rad RDA! 

And thank you very much! I‚Äôm hoping Episode 5 lives up to your expectations!!
Just getting some flavors to tinker with and a few to re-up staple supplies. Nothing too exciting coming from the sales.

Congrats on getting 4.5 written! Looking forward to more of your thoughts with number 5!
As long as you dont give us the directors cut and have the mtl equivalent of Greedo shooting first, I'm sure it will!
Damn, I really am the George Lucas of MTL vaping...
Thank you! It‚Äôs really appreciated! 

Sounds like a fun time, whatcha get to mess around with?
Haha, at least that's the angle I'm pushing..
It‚Äôs not an inaccurate one either lol
Few things to tinker with like green apple, cinnamon Danish, honey, and cake batter.

Beyond that it's pretty much all stuff I just need more of 'cause I mix too much
Aaaay my dude!

Having a relaxing 3-day weekend with the wife.

Vaping on some Jam Monster Blackberry; found it on sale for $9 and wanted to see what the hype was about üòÅ. Its very flavorful. 

Drinking a Blue Moon Pumpkin Wheat.

Playing Dead Cells on PS4.

That's it!
Sound like you‚Äôre making an apple pie...and I approve lol
Dead cells is so good dude. Haven‚Äôt played much myself but from what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs great.
Have to get used to the throat hit of salts again. Trying to stay in temp control and not go over 15w to see how long the coil lasts this time.
For some reason I keep putting off adding CAP cinnamon Danish swirl to an order.

Which is kind of stupid, that shit is delicious.
That wasn't *not* the plan. Really a few of them are for various ideas and just happen to (theoretically) mix well.
Haven't had it, it's in far too many recommendations for me to keep ignoring it.
I‚Äôm interested in what you have planned lol, excited to see what you end up making haha
The cake batter was largely in hopes of making something of a peanut buttery dessert and/or a rum cake.
Peanut butter cake would be rad. But in my experience peanut butter is hard to make not taste dry lol but I believe in you!!!
It's so, so good. Perfect bakery cinnamon, not the throat rapey kind of cinnamon... Rich and buttery smooth.

That, with some LA banana cream and a touch of your preferred coconut is damn tasty. Probably the first thing I ever mixed up that was better than commercial stuff.
Banana equivalent dose (BED) is an informal measurement of ionizing radiation exposure, intended as a general educational example to compare a dose of radioactivity to the dose one is exposed to by eating one average-sized banana.

I have had some success with a peanut butter cookie recipe, hopefully I can make the cake idea work.
Good to know. I haven't had a lot of luck with banana, either candy banana or a bit understated. Could probably do something nice with a good banana, the cinnamon Danish, caramel or butterscotch and a vanilla cream to make a real fully formed bananas foster though.
If you can make the cookie work then I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôd have success with the cake.
Oh God, not this again. I still have ptsd from last time.
I sure hope so.
I feel like you left out bourbon.. Or brandy.

The only banana I've had much luck with is LA banana cream. It's definitely distinctive, and isn't the most versatile, but when it works it works.

Everyone seems to praise tfa banana bread, but I never had luck. Seemed dry to me? My one friend who vapes recently got into DIY and he's done some nice banana stuff, but I'm unsure what he is using.
Been playing non-stop for 2 weeks. So good.
Rum actually, but yeah I did skip a note.

I may have to dive into banana flavors sometimeb soon.
apple dragon breath pie?

&amp;#x200B;

don't mind me, just lurking around...
Green apple is probably better suited to candies than pie base, but maybe some Fuji apple would do well for a pie base.

Who knows though, maybe a fall focused addition to the dragon flavor line is just around the corner.
how the fuck can I lurk if you answer?

Then again, if I posted, I defeated the lurk. Gets complicated fast.

0.o
Haha. Can't help with the logistics of your mind melter there.
Gentleman Jack will do that to you.. deep thoughting occurring here...
Not much of a gentleman if he's making your brain hurt.

Hope the night is going well.
Not bad, The Great Sock Emergency was averted earlier today - now have clean socks through to October so not bad, not bad..

You?
Found out VRV has a bunch of old Nickelodeon shows now, so I've been goofing off watching KaBlam for a bit.

Had my parents over for a BBQ this afternoon, that was fun.

What was this sock related emergency?
&gt; What was this sock related emergency?

My magic drawer of clean socks was mysteriously replaced by a month's worth of dirty socks - I had no clean socks. Was terrible. Documented the trials and tribulations over in the other other place
Gotcha. I have been wrapped up with a ton of crap I've been trying to keep ahead of lately so I have been slacking on the Reddit front, particularly this weekend.
I wish - I' ve been doing everything except what I planned on doing -&gt; The Lawn.
You too? The last 48 hours have been a clinic in ways other people can stop me from mowing the lawn.
dude, don't freak me out.. been like a fucking conspiracy..
Wife may be upset that my day off tomorrow is now mowing the lawn, vape shit, and working on a bicycle but she sort of forced my hand.
No more wife - got clients just as bad though - same plan - hope you win, I'm trying not to jinx it...
Was gonna try to do the vape shit tonight, but that isn't looking likely, so... Tomorrow it is. It stops being negotiable around 8pm tomorrow.
&gt; Was gonna try to do the vape shit tonight

Did that today, while waiting on socks lmao... fucking socks.... lmfao...
30 minutes to go. Going to try to watch the Walking Dead again. Gave up in season 4.

Client is enjoying it.
I gave up on season 3 I think. I might give it another shot though. My girlfriend loves it and we usually line up with TV so I‚Äôll try again sometime.
I don't watch much TV at home, except when I can't sleep. Won't put this on the, as it would wake my girlfriend.

She's able to sleep through Mythbusters, so that's what I watch at night.
Man, I haven‚Äôt watched mythbusters in ages. Are they still going with the two new hosts or did they cancel it?
Wait, did they reboot it or something?
They brought on two new hosts which were discount Adam and Jamie. They weren‚Äôt actually too bad but you could tell they were brought on because they resembled Adam and Jamie. Haven‚Äôt seen much of it due to not having the time but it was alright. Not sure if it‚Äôs ongoing though. 

At least they kept the narrator.
Ugh. I remember the original ending, and I was pretty happy that they just killed it after a killer run. Makes me sad they tried to bring it back.
Don't have cable so I haven't seen the new one. I got the reality show where they were trying to find new hosts because it was free but haven't watched that yet. Only got it because of Chris Hackett.
I hear Adam is doing a Mythbusters jr. type show now.
Eh, from what I saw it‚Äôs not actually too bad but it‚Äôs not the same.
Yes, and it just wrapped shooting the first season.

White Rabbit Project on Netflix wasn't bad.
I actually really liked it because it‚Äôs not trying to be mythbusters. It‚Äôs its own thing, just with Kari grant and tori. I forgot, did it have a second season?

Interested in the new series though

Summary:
I actually really liked it because it‚Äôs not trying to be mythbusters.
Don't have cable so I haven't seen the new one.
Man, I haven‚Äôt watched mythbusters in ages.
Haha dude it does look like a rad RDA!
Hope the night is going well.
Going to try to watch the Walking Dead again.
Was gonna try to do the vape shit tonight, but that isn't looking likely, so...
Dead cells is so good dude.
I still have ptsd from last time.
