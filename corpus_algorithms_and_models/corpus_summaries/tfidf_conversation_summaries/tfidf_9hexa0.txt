Original Response:
How do we know Q is even a real person and not a psyop?
Why not both?

&gt;[Psychological operations (PSYOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_(United_States)) are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.
Q is LARP for religious baby boomers.
That's what it seems like. "Vote Trump or the pedos win"     

Meanwhile Trump obviously wants to or wanted to fuck his own daughter.
But is it just one/a small group of bored 4chan peeps or is it CIA/FBI/NSA
Thank Q when you can feed your family, pay your rent, save for retirement and still have a good amount of money in the bank!
That what that loon LaJune said. She is a thief. Look her up on google
Oh yes, praise Q and his discoveries in Antarctica, that will help me pay rent.
You just told me to look her up on Google but in a comment on another page you say "You can't fact check on Google because they are owned by the MSM!" 

You, my friend, might be an idiot.
Why are you assuming I couldn't do all those things before all of this nonsense started?
Definitely not a LARP. A psyop of some kind. Do you know the difference?
I don't thank Q, I thank my motivation for not going to school for Lesbian Dance Theatre and getting a job in sciences.

As a responsible adult, you shouldn't rely on someone else to change your life. Rely on yourself to be the positive change that's needed.
Yes...
Is this.. what?
A psyop by a LARPer to rile up the Trumpies

4chan really is the greatest
Sorry, but no. You need to think a little more deeply.

Sorry, but that's incorrect.

Summary:
Look her up on google.
Rely on yourself to be the positive change that's needed.
