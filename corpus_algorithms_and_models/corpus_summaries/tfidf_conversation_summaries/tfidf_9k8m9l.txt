I'm pretty sure this is the third time I've seen PK do this now.

Edit: Yep. Mackinnon and Stepan as well.
fuck he does it every game
Fuck that peice of shit. Anybody can be a little bitch and punch somebody. Be a real player a take someone down by skill if you need to.
Takes quite a bit of strength and technique to single-arm body punch a 200 pound guy into the ground.
Takes a lot more strength to play the game properly and not let your emotions get the best of you.
This was hardly a punch and happens multiple times every game. Speaking of emotion, you got your mad out of your system?
I’m bitching on reddit. Uncontrolled emotion is reddit’s fuel.
He hit Mack out of fucking no where. I went ballistic. I cannot stand shit like this
Yup
You think this is dirty?
It isn’t Todd Bertuzzi level scum but it’s sure up there
This pk guy seems like a real Aho.
and Crosby
He didn't even show up to Predsfest this past Friday!  How dare he
How? He fucking hits him in the chest. You gonna put flags on the guys next and say no contact? There's literally nothing wrong with this hit
Doesnt take a rocket scientist to recognize a cheap shot mi amigo. Might be in the chest but it’s unwarranted and unnecessary.  This is a consistent thing for PK, this isn’t an outlier
Considering we're still in preseason it's pretty unnecessary.

Summary:
He fucking hits him in the chest.
fuck he does it every game.
He hit Mack out of fucking no where.
