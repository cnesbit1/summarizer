Original Response:
What are some non politically correct opinions about singapore/singaporeans that you very strongly believe in, but would never tell anyone you know IRL because of social backlash?

Edit: sort by controversial for best viewing experience
the average incoherent straits times commenter is actually a pretty good representation of the *average* singaporean (and their language skills).
Makes me fucking sad tbh. Most Singaporeans I believe are nice people but Facebook gives some of them the avenue to spill whatever nonsense they believe in and it kills my faith in some of us
And most people are more similar to the average commenter that they mock than the enlightened individuals they believe themselves to be
yeah well i suppose that makes you a Level 2 Enlightened One for calling that out eh
Nah you don't need to be a genius to recognize that you aren't one
Otoh discussion in this sub seems to be quite alright.
I wouldn't be too bothered. I think online forums bring the worst out of anyone, regardless of their nationality.
idk sometimes it turns into borderline r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM where people struggle to defend and legitimize both sides of every argument like it’s a debate class. *yeah sure racism is bad but have you ever considered the poor hurt feelings of the racists they’re both wrong* etc.
Lol this reminded me of the post when a guy said they should evict the whole family whose son threw a bike from their floor level.
I disagree. The participants like to think it is quite alright.
Yes. That's rather nonsense. Too humbug for me.
It scares me.
Self-awareness intensifies
NS should be for women as well. They can even serve in the SAF. There are already women regulars there and despite there being a general difference in physical strength between men and women, modern weapons such as guns, which rely on accuracy and tactics to outmaneuver the enemy, put them on an equal playing field. Even if some women can't serve in the SAF, they can serve elsewhere e.g. emergency medics in the SCDF, nurses at hospitals, charities etc.
NS is long overdue an overhaul. NS is absolutely necessary but the way it was implemented can be improved. Women should serve in less physically intensive sectors. Higher pay and lower duration of NS. More exemptions should be made for sportsman etc. Culture should change as well, NS men are lacking the respect they deserve.
Women should be paid more as well.
I can prove in microeconomics under asymmetry of information and wage determination that women should be paid lesser if we assume their periods make them less productive. I just had a friend who took mc because of cramps.
what?
#I CAN PROVE IN MICROECONOMICS UNDER ASYMMETRY OF INFORMATION AND WAGE DETERMINATION THAT WOMEN SHOULD BE PAID LESSER IF WE ASSUME THEIR PERIODS MAKE THEM LESS PRODUCTIVE. I JUST HAD A FRIEND WHO TOOK MC BECAUSE OF CRAMPS.
Username and caps lock, I like it, and just a head up, some females have very bad cramps, like to the point that they can barely do anything, so pls don’t try to downplay their pain
You do realise that some people get really bad cramps where they're basically bedridden for the day? Not to mention the bloating and sometimes extra discomfort they might get during their periods.
I believe that's a bot, doubt the owner will reply to you. I agree with your comment. However, there are always some black sheep that keng/fake their way out of nice things for everything in life making the rest look bad when they have genuine issues/concerns.
Good Bot
Are you sure about that? Because I am 96.15675% sure that AreYouDeaf is not a bot.

I doubt it's not politically correct though. A political conundrum would be a better way to describe it. We are gearing up for war if we don't get our own water resources/solutions with water agreements and our own technology. So lets hope the day never comes for that to happen really.
I agree with your points based on an a genderless society where effort equals payoff. The majority of females don't do equal lifting of heavy stuff and take more leave/off for pregnancy or caregiving reasons. 

But applying this rule will end up with us being a very uncaring society. So feminists better don't keep harping for equality, you might just get what you wish for.
From the way i see it, there are actually many women who are fitter than men. Women today are very different from the ones in the 60s (when ns was first introduced). I could understand that in the past, women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family, but today you see so many women embracing active lifestyles (going gym, marathon etc.) that it is no longer an excuse for them not to serve ns. If our physically unfit/obese ns boys can do it, i dont see why majority of the women can’t. Perhaps they can take on the less physically demanding vocations like clerk, medic, signaller etc. for a start. Or at the very least, go for bmt to learn basic survival skills, weapon handling etc. Every citizen should play a part in defending this nation, not just the males.
I'm a guy and I oppose women serving NS, and I feel THAT's the non political correct thought lol, amongst men probably. I don't want the other half of the local population to waste 2 years of their lives just to make a point. Unless the govt deems it really necessary due to the declining population, then fair enough.
What if the total length of NS for guys could be shortened due to the increased manpower? Would you still be against it?
Both men and women should serve only 1 year just like South Korea.
Would probably never happen. Decreasing service time even further (as much as I would like it to) would cause higher turnover rates, and less staying time.

Right now, would-be officers would train for 11 months and serve for another 11 months, specialists would be 7 months training and 15 months service. Any meaningful decrement would mean that you will likely spend more time training people than using them.
Bad Bot.
Well the concept here is equal pay for equal work. Regardless of gender or disability. 

If you can only make 100 products a month don't expect to be paid the same as someone who makes 200 a month.

While very harsh i think its fair. The difference can be compensated a la disability benefits etc. But I'm not a politician so this is purely my idea of what'd happening.
But your friend is taking MC for cramps. Why penalize people further for using their sick leave?
[deleted]
That's why everyone has a designated amount of sick days/paid time off as a buffer I think. Use them however you like but you only get so many before pay could be affected. 

Of course exceptions might be granted but that's up to the employer/ workplace laws like maternity leave etc.

I'd imagine if paid time off was not rationed, the incentive to take one willy nilly is very high.
Yeah I agree with you but the previous guy stated that women should be paid less because their periods make them less productive, using a friend who took MC because of cramps as an example.

That, I believe, is going overboard.
Feminists want equal rights? They should fight for a place in NS too
Totally support for females to serve NS. Also, to make it fair, both males and females will be assigned to all units i.e if there is a new nursing vocation, it’s not limited to just females; males can get assigned there too. Doing this, we can reduce NS to 14 to 18 months and reservist cut down to four years. If only the government has the guts to do this.
Won't be surprised if it does become an eventuality with the ever-declining birth rate. However, it would also most likely be a logistical &amp; administrative nightmare for the first few months or even years.
I think its only right that those who want to go command school be made to serve longer. There should be stricter criteria for those that want to assume a leadership role because i see way too many that are just there for the allowance/glory. I think the whole point of NS is to actually equip our servicemen with sufficient military knowledge and not just ‘use’ them. In my experience, most nsf have a lull period towards the end of their service, due to clearing offs/leave and new batch of personal coming in to assume their role. Personally i spend nearly 6 months not doing anything (everyday mobile legend and sleep). This is just keeping us around for the sake of keeping us around. Its also really unfair for those that have been “used” to do meaningless things like packing funpack or doing silly dances for NDP because it exploits nsf and insults the whole meaning to NS. Just my 2 cents.
There are some ns in the world that does this like Cyprus. Apparently equality is applied when it is convenient.
lol do you know what you are talking about? Hope they can tahan the load required to be carried for medics and signallers, which is the usual fullpack+ilbv+rifle and the medic pack+ stretcher or the signal set + x00% batteries.
It's fine, think about how it was also a logistical and administrative nightmare when NS was first implemented all those years ago.
Lol of course i know what im talking about, im a signaller myself. You do know that there are many different types of signallers right. I myself have never even carried a full signal set lol. There are so many that are just stationed at hq, command post, etc. Likewise, i have friends that are service medic and they are stationed at medical centres.
Cat welfare groups in Singapore are irritating and overbearing. 

Insisting everyone who wants to foster/adopt cats follow CWS guidelines. Esp the windows meshing one

I have three cats, I don’t look to adopt/foster. But when ppl from these groups find out I don’t mesh my windows, they gasp and accuse me of being negligent etc. 

I educate my cats and provide ample platform for them to look out the window so they won’t jump onto the ledge to do just that. I exercise them so much they are usually content with just lying on their tree. And I don’t criticise ur choices, so don’t come into my house to teach me what I can or cannot do.
I'm actually interested to get a cat in Singapore. But I am super worried about it jumping onto a ledge and falling down. Is the meshing expensive / needed?
The CWS guidelines state that meshing is needed. 
It is also inexpensive. 
Remember, adopt, don’t buy. 

Personal experience, my cats use to walk on the ledge all the time until I made some changes and provided platforms for them to be able to look out the window and that behaviour stopped. I also splashed water on them whenever they walked along the ledge at the start
100％ on the adopt. If I do take the plunge, I guess I will do the meshing because my heart won't be able to take it otherwise.

What kind of advice would you give a first time pet owner?
If you think it isn’t, please go to any “lost pets in Singapore” facebook group and see the sheer number of posts of corpses of cats that fell from height. 

Or those from genius aunties going “please help my expensive purebreed baby I pay $1000 for is lost he never wander out before I don’t know how this could happen” &lt;attached cat pic; in background open windows and gate with grills wide enough to shove a watermelon through&gt;

Thinking you can somehow teach a cat to not be a cat is ridiculously irresponsible. Not spending like &lt;$50 at most to mesh up your windows (or at the very least keep them permanently closed) because you’re selfish or “aesthetics” is even more irresponsible.

*(edit: you know what?* [I’ll do it for you](https://imgur.com/a/nqadOzD). *Here you go. Just from a quick trawl of one fb group, 11 mostly dead cats thanks to shitty ownership.* **Entirely** *preventable.)*
Cats are “independent”. 

But they still need lots of attention and love. 

Neuter him/her because they get Super uncomfortable when in heat. 

Clear the litter at least once a day. Cats hate being caged up and appreciate height. So get a cat condo. 

Vary their food, as in, provide a constant supply of kibbles but treat them to wet food as well. 

Grow some wheatgrass for them as well. 

These are specific to cats.


PM me for info on where to get cheaper cat supplies.
Nah meshing should be compulsory if you leave the windows open. Know TOOOO many irresponsible owners mourning the death of their cats which fall from the windows. We have do many high rise buildings, it's the right thing to do.
Damn, is that all it costs? I'll definitely do it. I wouldn't be able to live with myself otherwise
I know of a family who wanted to adopt, was refused because their window isn’t meshed. Had the police called on them because their window wasn’t meshed, and they had cats, and they’re being cruel to the cats by not meshing the windows. 

I agree with your points, I just feel cat welfare groups are overbearing and unreasonable. 

Why? 

Because the family lives on the ground floor.
You can buy mesh grilles and zip ties from daiso, easy. If you want I can take a pic of my door later and show you.

Before we even got our cats at my new place, I shelled out a bit of cash to change all the grilles to ones with thin horizontal bars with a 1”-2” gap. Looks good while being impossible to squeeze through as the boys are pretty round. But you can use the daiso method on window grilles too.
It’s not just about falls from height, you know. What if your neighbors are shitty or just plain don’t like your cat coming in and in extreme cases stealing their food/pooping and peeing around? AVA trapping or poison bait exercises in the area? Dogs in the neighborhood (stray or owned) seeing an easy target to harass? Asshole sociopathic kids? Singapore is too heavily urbanised and hostile of a place to support free-roaming cats.
I'll definitely do some research. My lifestyle is not compatible with pets as I travel almost every week
I don’t disagree with any of your points.

My cats aren’t free roaming, my windows arent meshed. I’m just saying that don’t come in and accuse me of shit when my cats aren’t misbehaving or in danger. I do the necessary and they are well behaved enough not to even go near the ledges anymore. 

Yes, there are idiots whose cats fall out of windows. And yes, window meshing is the cheapest and most effective solution to that. But no, my cats are safe because they are well behaved and haven’t given me cause for concern in 5years (5yrs ago is the last time they walked on the window ledge). When I’m not home, windows are closed.
So cute! Your cats look out of the window at other people passing by? If I don't have children I will totally have a zoo at home.
more like cars zooming past
where can i get wheatgrass/growing medium?
Most pet lover centres sell them. However those tend to attract a lot of flies. 

I use hydroponics to grow them and get the seeds from a supplier in Ang Mo Kio. I’ll be happy to point you in the right direction via pm.

U can also grow them using soil if u can contend with flies.
Jesus. Some **humans** can't be educated to mesh their windows/doors how the fuck does one expect to educate a cat to go against its natural instincts
I imagine a cat being sternly talked to over the dinner table like this [https://imgur.com/nuduwdr](https://imgur.com/nuduwdr) and a human in a cat onesie with a laser pointer and a powerpoint slide. At the end, the cat goes, "So let me get this straight, you want me to look at a bird outside and NOT jump out to catch it?"
I can understand where you’re coming from, but in a country where it’s so easy for cats to jump off a ledge/railings or go straight into traffic, mesh and nets were the first thing I thought of too when we decided to adopt a cat. Educating cats is one thing, but accidents (and reacting to instinct) is another. You don’t put children next to a burning (open?) stove unattended just because you taught them fire is dangerous.
2nd one from me. 

I have gay friends. I have lesbian friends. 
I respect their choice. 
But don’t force it down on me to support their cause to repeal 377A cos I don’t want my future children to think it’s ok to go down that route. 
Respecting your choice doesn’t meant I need to support it.


Edit: my point has been poorly put across in the post above. 

I respect their sexuality, but do not support their cause. Yes, because I might have children, and I certainly hope that they do not turn out to be gay or lesbian. 

My main grouse, however, is how my friends from the community, or those in support of them, pesters me to support their cause, when I have declined. 

The post above has not been edited because that would make several replies seem out of sync.
I am too worried of the gay agenda. If you look towards gender fluidity, you can kind of sense a sub culture brewing. I’m schizophrenic and I think of myself as a machine sometimes. So can you imagine the psychological trauma these non binary teens are facing to identify as a machine or a banana?
You can use the inside of a banana peel to clean and polish leather shoes.

&gt;choice

Aaaaand that's where I started laughing.
&gt;I respect their choice

I’m sorry but this is a really big misunderstanding, sexuality isn’t a choice, it’s who you are. If your future children are gay then they are gay, there is nothing that will change that, 377a or not. I hope you understand
Sure. Just don’t tell me that I should support 377a because it isn’t a choice.
Ya it’s your choice to support 377a or not, I don’t have any right to stop you. But I just want to raise awareness that sexuality isn’t a choice, I mean even LKY said that sexuality isn’t a choice.
Ok. I stand corrected. Poor choice of words from me. I apologise.
Eh. But if you acknowledge that it isn't a choice, then your original argument falls apart, does it not? 

I can't force you to support repeal, but there shouldn't be any reason to *be against* it.
I wonder whether this bot is really just a version of the billboard posters in Fight Club. 

"DID YOU KNOW YOU CAN USE OLD MOTOR OIL TO FERTILISE YOUR LAWN?"
Then why are you forcing 377A on them?
Every time I see someone who refers to sexuality as a choice, I ask them: So at what point in your life did you choose to be straight? I mean it's a choice, like you come to some crossroad and have to decide to go left or right yeah? So when did you choose to be straight? 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Sexuality is not a choice.
Actually the law is not useful and could be repealed. It has nothing to do with support or respect for the rainbow community
Hahaha that's kind of funny. The best you can do is to tell your kids to avoid the media. That's the only why they can make up their own mind s
I’m not forcing 377A on anybody. 

I just don’t like my friends, gay or otherwise, coming to me and telling me to sign whatever petition and go to pink dot to support them. 

Like I said, I respect your sexuality (not choice, I know), but respect my right to not support your cause.
How does my argument fall apart? 

Just a poor choice of words from me.

The argument, when corrected, is 

“I respect your sexuality, but don’t force me to support a cause I don’t believe in”
agree with all of this

plus, there are religious people/people living in conservative countries who struggle with being gay. If sexuality was a choice, then why wouldn't they just '''''choose''''' to be straight and not have to worry about being persecuted or ostracised?

sigh
Repeal it. That’s not in my hands. Just stop forcing propaganda down my throat
I understand your stance. 

However it's a cause you don't believe in because you don't want your children to "think it's ok to go down that route." If you accept that people are gay because they are born that way, surely it won't matter if the law exists because your children will either be born that way, or not.

I mean, nobody ever said "Let's go against SINDA in case the children think it's ok to turn Indian."
Your points are valid as my future kids are one of my legitimate concerns. 

I concede this point.
The LGBT community isn't the biggest in Singapore. They need the support from friends and family to make their voices heard. 377A is an outdated law and should not be held over their heads. 

Imagine if there's a law that criminalizes sex between mutually consenting heterosexual couples, and the government's only compromise is to promise not to enact it for now.

I respect your right not to support their cause, but it's very difficult to see how you're respecting their sexuality.
I respect their sexuality by not voicing out my opposition to it. And I would defend them against such people, like the many who replied have done.  

Respecting and supporting are two very different actions.

Like I respect your points of view although I do not necessarily agree with it. 

And I do agree 377A is an outdated law that should not be kept if not enforced ( what’s the point right? ), but my comment might have been misconstrued. 

By all means, the LGBT community has a right to go out and garner support, but do not badger me (as some of my friends have done), for not putting my name down on a petition which the government is going to ignore anyway.

I hope you realise that this is something you have no control over, and any attempts to do so is 


1) hypocritical since you claim to respect their sexuality, and


2) is a form of abuse, depending on your view on it. 


Put very simply, your actions (or lack thereof) regarding 377A has no bearing on the sexuality of your hypothetical child. 


This goes 4 ways, in which the only way this can possibly harm your child is that you choose not to support the repeal of 377A:


1: Child is straight, bill repealed. No difference. 


2: Child is straight, bill not repealed. No difference. 


3: Child is gay/les, bill repealed. Child will not be breaking the law to fulfill his/her sexual destiny. 


4: Child is gay/les, bill not repealed. Child can possibly be arrested.


&gt;My main grouse, however, is how my friends from the community, or those in support of them, pesters me to support their cause, when I have declined. 


Try thinking from another point of view. Some asshole is obsessed over your penis/vagina, and is trying with the help of other equally obsessed weirdos to control it. 


&gt;The post above has not been edited because that would make several replies seem out of sync. 


I applaud you for your courage, and implore you to rethink your stance.
I agree mostly with your points. But this is exactly what I’m talking about. Despite declining to support the cause, people are still forcing their ideas on me. 


Yes. Sexuality isn’t a choice. Let me draw an extreme parallel. 

Homosexuality isn’t a choice. They are born this way, according to proponents of the LGBT community. By the same reasoning, proponents of paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia can easily proclaim the same. Bear in mind I am drawing an extreme parallel. 

Are we to say, let’s repeal statutory rape because paedophiles are born this way?
&gt;I agree mostly with your points. But this is exactly what I’m talking about. Despite declining to support the cause, people are still forcing their ideas on me.


'The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'


&gt;Yes. Sexuality isn’t a choice. Let me draw an extreme parallel. 


&gt;Homosexuality isn’t a choice. They are born this way, according to proponents of the LGBT community. By the same reasoning, proponents of paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia can easily proclaim the same. Bear in mind I am drawing an extreme parallel. 


&gt;Are we to say, let’s repeal statutory rape because paedophiles are born this way? 


A very candid point, but let's look at the definition of rape as specified by Singapore Law:


'Any man who penetrates the vagina or a woman with his penis (a) without her consent; or (b) with or without her consent, when she is under 14 years of age, shall be guilty of an offence.'


Let's just ignore (b) to debate this point.


The thing about


&gt;paedophilia, necrophilia and zoophilia


is simply that none of the victims (for lack of a better word) in the aforementioned categories are in any capacity to provide consent. That's why it's called statutory **rape**. 


That said, homosexual intercourse with a minor is still statutory rape. Homosexual intercourse with another consensual adult is none of anyone's business except the parties involved.
Yes, your argument is fully on point. 
Therein lies mine, it isn’t paedophilia if it’s not underage, maybe we should repeal all laws regarding sexual intercourse with minors because they are born this way? 


How is the law evil? The law seeks to protect the natural order. If legislators find that there is a new natural order and decide to repeal the law, then so be it. 

We have devolved from my frustration at being pestered to support a cause I don’t believe in, to making horrific tangents and suggestions. 

That said, it’s nice to have an intellectual debate for once.
&gt;Yes, your argument is fully on point. 
&gt;Therein lies mine, it isn’t paedophilia if it’s not underage, maybe we should repeal all laws regarding sexual intercourse with minors because they are born this way? 


I don't see the logic behind that. The issue at hand regarding homosexual intercourse is not one of consent. Paedophilia, necrophilia and Zoophilia is. 


Just because you are homosexual  doesn't mean you can have sex with any person you want. You still have to seek consent first.


When you argue for paedophilia to be legal (I'm not saying you do btw, just an expression), the main debate isn't about your sexual preferences. The problem is that the other party legally cannot provide consent.


People under a certain age (The actual age is a topic irrelevant to the discussion at hand) legally *cannot* give consent. Same goes for corpses and animals. 


Sex of any nature with a party that is legally incapable of providing consent is rape. This applies to everyone regardless of your sexual orientation.


Your argument is a red herring, not a slippery slope. 


&gt;How is the law evil? The law seeks to protect the natural order. If legislators find that there is a new natural order and decide to repeal the law, then so be it. 


The Law isn't inherently evil, but there are evil people who wish to impose their will upon others through it.
Yes I do agree with you. The wayang is off topic

Second this, the government wouldnt want to cause any unnecessary panic.
You'll be surprised how "nice" our neighbours are everyday :')
They’ve already reduced it to 1 year 10 months from 2.5 years. My question to is, how Long do we need to train men so they can remain operationally ready?
1 year 10 months? Where did you get that information?
Guess you’re not physically fit
I'm pretty sure it has always been 2 years
1 years 10 months if you’re pes fit
Ah ok

Summary:
I respect their sexuality, but do not support their cause.
Yes I do agree with you.

NS should be for women as well.

Actually the law is not useful and could be repealed.
Would you still be against it?
Women should be paid more as well.
I know of a family who wanted to adopt, was refused because their window isn’t meshed.
I just had a friend who took mc because of cramps.

Totally support for females to serve NS.
That's the only why they can make up their own mind s.
Your cats look out of the window at other people passing by?
Respecting your choice doesn’t meant I need to support it.
But your friend is taking MC for cramps.

2: Child is straight, bill not repealed.
I believe that's a bot, doubt the owner will reply to you.
It’s not just about falls from height, you know.
I respect your right not to support their cause, but it's very difficult to see how you're respecting their sexuality.
Yes, your argument is fully on point.
lol do you know what you are talking about?
I think its only right that those who want to go command school be made to serve longer.
Try thinking from another point of view.
