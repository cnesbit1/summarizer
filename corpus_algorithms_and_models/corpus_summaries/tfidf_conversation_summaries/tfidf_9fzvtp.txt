Original Response:
Sleeping naked when you're alone just feels so nice. Especially when you've just put fresh sheets on the bed.
I am addicted to this by now if I don't do it it takes me some time to sleep.
AND if you've just gotten out of the shower

You should feel it when the cat rubs against your freshly shaved legs- sooooo soft!
No one tells you this stuff, but this is one of the little things you have to stop doing when you have kids. I haven’t had a perfect sleep in 11 years.
I hold sheets for that moment where I need a little TLC. After a nice long shower, all clean and with clean sheets... Like a spa, but cheaper
Now, what would this feel like if you were on ecstasy?...
Now I have to try to sleep naked in clean sheets with shaved legs on ecstasy.
When I try to my legs get sticked to each other as well as my arms to my body. It's not comfortable. How do you deal with that?
No having kids doesn’t mean you have to stop-unless your kids sleep in your bed.
But do you? Teach your kids boundaries (meaning knock and wait), and have a robe nearby if you need to get up.
Cover your entire body with roll on antiperspirant and pray
Or a kid comes in at 3 a.m. and pukes all over your floor. Source: have 4 kids.
I've slept nude for years, literally never had the problem you're describing.
And if you have a heated blanket
AND just shaved your legs
I have kids too. Just keep your PJs next to the bed if they need you.
Quite painful actually. I couldn’t stop dancing in bed and accidentally kicked the cat. She kicked back but without the leg hair, there was nothing I could do. I’m still bleeding and now my new sheets are ruined. 10/10 would ecstasy again.
Ask the lady in the truck.
And you’ve sprayed your pillow with lavender oil.
It's not a well known fact, but kids wont die by seeing naked people. Teach them that nudity is natural and not only associated with sex instead.
There’s honestly no such thing as sleep on ecstasy.

that visual made me snort-laugh, so thanks for that. i might have actually had something like that happen with my cat years ago....
Report back with the results.
Me too! I'm fat though.
Body pillow *with an easily-washed cover*.
Don’t let the kids ruin it! I often fall asleep naked. My kids are at an age where they don’t care or are unimpressed by my nakedness. And I do keep a tank and shorts or a robe by the bed for when I have to tuck in the three yr old or whatever. Also lock your door. It’ll give you the 10 seconds to get dressed.
Really. I call my hubby a prude. He locks three doors to take a shower. Granted we have all girls but still! It’s just a body. Bodies aren’t all about sex.
I hear you, I experience the same thing sometimes. I generally sleep with just sports bra/underwear so I don't have to deal with it, but sometimes I just really want to be naked. My solution is basically just how I wrap the blanket around me. Tuck a side between my knees, and wrap the top around my torso. That or hold a pillow/sleep with my arms in a different position. I think it's something that tends to happen more in humid climates, at least for me.

call me paranoid but him locking three doors is a little worrying in case he has an accident in the shower. You'd have to bust down THREE doors before you can even help him.
I sprawl out like a starfish.
Then why do I get arrested when I walk around naked in my front yard?
I have 3 kids who are now all teenagers. I've slept naked since before they were born. They know to knock before entering my bedroom and it has never been an issue.
Get flannel sheets
Nothing better than popping E alone &amp; crawling into bed for a goodnight sleep ☺️
I have locks to all the doors taped to the top of the door way in the event of an emergency. But yes that’s the excuse I use on the kids when they take a bath. No locked doors.
Unless your house is cold
