I was gonna ask this too. Where do you drink? Could be more of a subconscious “I don’t want you to have a reason to go to places where you might cheat on me” kind of thing with her......

Gas lighting involves intent to manipulate. She may just have different standards and may genuinely feel uncomfortable with his drinking (in which case, they’re just incompatible). We need to make sure we aren’t jumping to gas lighting (a form of emotional abuse) when there isn’t any actual indication that is happening.
Actually, those people may be able to give you better advice because they could see your gf’s side.

I was raised by two alcoholics, I barely drink myself, and I’d have issues with dating anyone who couldn’t control their drinking. For what it’s worth, it doesn’t sound like you have a problem if you’re being honest with us (though it’s true that alcoholics won’t always be honest... but I’m choosing to believe you). However, if she (like me) has extra sensitivities surrounding alcohol, then she (like me) needs to find a partner who shares those values instead of demanding her partner changes their values. You two truly just sound incompatible. I don’t think you have a problem, but you do drink more than I would personally be comfortable with. But I recognize that’s my own problem, not my partners problem. So I shouldn’t be dating you. But I don’t think you have an objective problem, so I wouldn’t be trying to have an intervention or anything either. Y’all are just incompatible.
She got upset when he used sherry in his cooking so it seems she feels very strongly about no alcohol at all, ever. This isn't something they'll be able to compromise on I think, her views are too extreme.
&gt;99.9% he's trying to get sympathy for being a washed up 30-something whose conversations revolve around chocolate infused IPAs made with sour patch kids and goose down. That shit is so boring.

Dude.

Wow. There's a lot of projection to unpack here. No where did OP indicate his behavior was anywhere close to what you've described.
I'm on your side here. I think that comment is one of the best fanfics I've read in this comment section in a while, but if this is the tone you took with your gf (and I could see it happening based on the history you gave us) it's no wonder she wouldn't believe you.

edit: missing a word
Yea that's what I'm wondering, maybe she just doesn't like OP going to drinking events since she should drink. 

I can see why it would makem them incompatible but obviously 20 drinks in a month isn't a drinking problem
Typically people who only posted their story to get answers confirming their own opinions shouldn't post at all
Wow. You're making a lot of assumptions here and don't be absurd. Chocolate goes in stouts not ipas.

Look at all your responses.  You argue with anyone who isn't telling you what you want to hear.

I mean, I don't really drink myself, but assuming your count of 20 drinks spread across 30 days is accurate, sure.  But if you don't think your drinking is a problem, and your girlfriend does, what outcomes are you expecting? Obviously, you are either going to give up your girlfriend or give up your drinking cause you value the relationship more than the alcohol.  I'm not sure if there's some other route you're seeking here, but the whole thing reeks of seeking validation rather than advice.
A lot of us have seen exactly what alcohol does to a person and their life.

My ex boyfriend loved his alcohol more than me too. He’s dead now.

Yo dude, there are some fuckin weirdos in this thread. Just don't interact with them
