Original Response:
I'm looking to expand my breedables collection! Here is my [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1re4GvNeXdAHy0bPUU8V0hM7JCfdWY3bZRyDY6pKaCtU/edit?usp=sharing). If you see a Pokémon without a nature, it's just because I haven't bred for its optimal nature yet.

I'm mainly looking for apriball or special ball HA Pokémon with \~4 EM (preferably as competitive as possible), but feel free to make offers.

Some Pokémon I'm looking for specifically:

* ~~Ferroseed, 0 speed IV, with \~4 EM (Specifically spikes, stealth rock, and leech seed)~~
* ~~HA Squirtle with 4 EM~~
* ~~Any of the other HA starters I'm missing~~
* ~~Deino in a moon or beast ball--but any special ball will do. EM don't matter as much for this guy~~
* ~~Scyther with 4 EM~~
Is there something in [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QZAaRMK9gd3e_O3s8R53bkHqQrou40x6JP870e7DRK4/edit#gid=0) that interest you?
Timid Charmander, Moon Carvanha, Moon Litwick, and Lure Mareanie all catch my eye. What are you interested in?
Safari HA Gligar, Love HA Shroomish, Love HA Treecko and Friend HA Chespin. Need to breed all of them so might take some time
That's OK. I am working on the last one for you. Let me know when you're free to trade.
Your Pokémon are all ready.
When do you think you will be available?

That might be troublesome. Im in CEST which means you are 7 hours behind me. Also I wont be available till monday after 7pm (my time). Maybe I might have some time on Sunday but cant make that promise..
Sorry about that &gt;.&lt;
That’s ok. I understand if you want to call it off.
I never said anything about calling the trade off. Either way, sorry for the late reply. I will be available for the next 4 hours.
I’m sorry, I’m at work.
My apologies for my bad availability but I should be online all day long
I’m sorry this has been so troublesome. I should be available in ~5 hours.
That might be work for me possibly. Though it will be close to bedtime for me
I'm available if you are now.
What is your availability during the day or weekends?

Summary:
I'm available if you are now.
I will be available for the next 4 hours.
I should be available in ~5 hours.
