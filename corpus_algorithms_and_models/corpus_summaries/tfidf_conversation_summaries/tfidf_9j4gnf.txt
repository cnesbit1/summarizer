&gt;easy experiment to setup

Well, tubs hold a few gallons and humans have around 5 liters of blood... just give me a sec while I extract enough blood from several humans to fill it...
&gt; They are attracted by carbon dioxide from the exhalation of mammals

What if I left an amount of dry ice in a bottle - eventually it fills it with co2.  Does it go inside and suffocate?
Anecdotally, I've had drops of fresh blood on my skin, and seen mosquitoes land next to it and just suck it up through their straw, not bothering to bite me somewhere else.

Hey... are you ok?  It's been a minute or so and I'm getting worried....

From various experiments I've seen documented with mosquitos, I've noted that feeding often occurs one of two ways. First way is to [trick an intern into sticking his arm in the chamber](https://i.imgur.com/lP5PQpf.jpg). Second way is essentially an IV bag filled with blood, which unless there's some mechanism for delivering co2 or your bacterial byproducts, would seem to indicate some ability to detect blood by itself?
Still no response, I'm worried they must be bleeding out.  Does anybody know where /u/Snow75 lives?  He needs help.

Quick, someone release some mosquitos and see if they will head toward a tub of blood!
Why were people returning them? The smell?
&gt; They are attracted by carbon dioxide from the exhalation of mammals, bacteria byproducts that munch on sweat

So you're telling me all I have to do to keep mosquitoes at bay is to quit breathing and quit sweating?

/r/lifeprotips here  I come.

I assume because they were attracting mosquitoes right over by where their patio was.
I am hoping that someone who Knows will post.  I've only seen the "trick someone into sticking their arm in" method.  If we could lure mosquitoes into drinking from tubs of blood, it seems to me that that provides a method for annihilating mosquitoes.  Some Africans bleed their cattle rather than slaughtering them.  So that's half of the job done, right? The other half is putting something into the blood that will make the mosquitoes die or fail to breed.  Maybe HFCS. (j/k)
It attracts large amounts of mosquitoes but doesn’t suck them in immediately they were putting them near their pools and blaming it for increasing mosquitoes.
They are attracted to CO2 sublimating from dry ice.  Never set it up so that they could be trapped by it.  

CO2 suddenly erupting from a lake smothered livestock and humans so I don't know why it wouldn't kill mosquitoes, too. Maybe not as quickly as with larger animals.

Mosquito smells the CO2 from the trap, comes over to investigate and low and behold fresh humans to feast on!
If you quit breathing long enough, mosquitoes do lose interest in you and/or access to your remains.

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense and should be obvious looking back on it.
This is a classic mistake with a lot of traps. 

Like at the campsite where people would make wasp traps from a plastic bottle, some sweet syrup etc and hang them around their site to kill the few annoying wasps. Within the hour they were swarmed by wasps attracted to the cloud of sweet smell.

That doesn’t really work outdoors, it would disappear almost instantly . Indoors it might last 5 minutes if you’re lucks
I always thought I was just unlucky for being so attractive to mosquitoes apparently. Nope. Turns out it's one of those side effects of being a runner. It was a sad thing to learn. haha.
Do if I just stop breathing for 8 hours while sleeping, I won't suffer from mosquito bites
Not relevant, but CO2 doesn't melt, it sublimates from a solid straight to a gas.
Dry ice? That's your solution for everything?
So if I held my breath when there was a bunch of mosquitoes around would I be harder to detect and they would land on other people around me more until I started breathing again?

Also not relevant: co2 has a triple point, one at which solid, liquid and gas all exist.

The traps work perfectly.. for their neighbors. They're just taking one for the team.
We use a Mosquito Magnet but keep it in the corner of our fenced yard.  There is a large wooded utility easement that incubates mosquitoes frequently.  The Magnet clears out about an acre around us.  Our neighbors thank us!  Lol

There’s three parts to their attack. Smell sets them in the right direction, then they look for high contrast to locate you. Then they go for heat. 
Leave a lid on a BBQ. There’ll be thousands of dead bodies by the morning. If you watch a camp fire you’ll see them all racing each other into oblivion.
I heard back in the day that they find humans via CO2 since we give it off so readily, but then once they're close enough to detect body odors, they head for the feet smell since that's where they're least likely to get slapped (I guess that's a chicken/egg conjecture, but it makes sense to me).

You can buy human blood from a bunch of vendors for research purposes:

Why does it have to be human blood?  Wouldn't any mammalian blood work?

Whole human blood is $511.00 for ~450ml. A bathtub holds about 80 gallons, or ~300 liters. So to fill the tub you'd need to buy 667 units, for a total of $340,667.

Gotta use up they grant money somehow! If you don't you'll get less next year!
Sounds like it's a good time to get into the whole selling your own blood market to me!
