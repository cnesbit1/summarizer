Original Response:
SS:  The fact that there's even a chance Matt Lauer will ever be on television again should tell you there's some major fuckery afoot.  The details of what he did should not be ignored.  Why is he not under arrest?

[Details](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/29/business/media/nbc-matt-lauer.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=photo-spot-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news) of how Lauer raped this woman.
Where did you see he had a fancy door locking button under his desk?  I didn't see that in this article. Not doubting you,  just increased. 

I mean having a door locker under your desk sounds pretty bad,  like movie supervillian bad.
&gt; In 2001, the woman said, Mr. Lauer, who is married, asked her to his office to discuss a story during a workday. When she sat down, she said, he locked the door, which he could do by pressing a button while sitting at his desk. (People who worked at NBC said the button was a regular security measure installed for high-profile employees.)

I'm picturing it under his desk maybe.  Regardless, it was a button reachable from his desk.

There's always a chance someone will hire him because it's always possible someone else in the industry lacks morals. All this article shows is that he's creeping back around, which was inevitable as time passed from the accusations and his being fired. We have no idea what went on beyond the accusations so there's many possible reasons as to why he was never charged.
They will give him some sort of come back award and applaud his bravery
They gonna install a second button in his office this time
Finally gets his trap door and pit hes always dreamed of
An anonymous complaint to the New York Times long after the alleged incident.  The alleged victim didn't go to law enforcement of human resources at her company.   Do you automatically believe this sort of claim in any newspaper, especially one with such a bad track record regarding honesty and background checking?

It may well be true, but God help us all if our new standard is simply somebody said something to someone at the New York Times.
I don't know who this guy is why do you watch so much TV?

Is the NYT a good news paper?

And he's probably not in jail because she didn't report it to the police so it wasn't investigated and guilt could not be established.
The first line of that article says hes been fired *over an allegation* 

So this whole thing could be made up by some angry lady
Certainly not gonna take the chance to have to pay out his contract and let him go
Maybe it was made up.  Watced this and yup sure enough he was fired soon after.

Uh what about Laurer apologizing as linked in the article..?
That's what this country has come to. Guilty until proven innocent unfortunately. So many times recently things like this have come out (often years or decades later) that I feel like must of us are becoming numb to how serious this sort of thing actually is. Makes me feel sad for the people who have actually had these sort of things happen to them, who dont get the justice they deserve because to the public it just seems like another day. Also makes me angry for the peoples whose lives were ruined by accusations that turned out to not to be true. Those peoples lives will never be the same.
ii'm guessing statute of limitations is the reason he hasn't been charged. Also, he's on the wrong "side." Did you notice how fast metoo fizzled out? Weinstein was a sacrificial lamb and that was all they wanted. Spacey got caught in the crossfire.

CK, some people definitely wanted to take down even though what he did wasn't even that bad
I understand that by design, it locks people out, rather than inside the office. Kind of like your house... Door locked to keep Intruders out, not to trap you inside.
I'm really getting tired of the lack of objectivity and critical thinking on Reddit. It gets worse by the day. 

The article OP linked:

&gt;One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her. She provided her account to The New York Times but declined to let her name be used. She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse.

Unnamed. No criminal complaint. She claimed she passed out. She did not claim she was "raped until she passed out" as OP words it. 

Now, I don't know exactly what Laurer did to get fired. But, if it wasn't important enough to file a police report then it didn't rise the level of criminality, nor should it be considered anything but a private matter between the parties involved. And if they don't think it's important enough to air out the details in public then frankly, I don't care.
HRC getting Matt Lauer fired for asking a question about the email server that was not pre-approved by her campaign during the [Commander In Chief Forum](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/commander-in-chief-forum) makes a lot more sense than unsubstantiated sexual harassment claims. 

edit: OMG, I went looking for more information about this. [Found this CNN video](https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/media/matt-lauer/index.html) from November 2017 when Lauer was fired. They lead the video with a clip from the Commander-In-Chief forum which is what is being claimed as the real reason for Lauer being fired. Now why would they lead the video with that? Is it coincidence? Or are they letting people know the real reason without being obvious.
You realize that rape is a traumatic event and that many victims don't report it because of all the bullshit they'd have to go through at trial. And most rapists walk free anyway so even if a victim took their rapist to trial, odds are in the rapist's favor. So the alternate theory to your's is that the victim didn't want to bring a national celebrity to court only to have said celebrity lawyer up good and whoop their ass in court, and then everyone thinks they lied about being raped. Considering all the things we know he was fired for, is one more rape really all that hard to believe?
At this point I'd say he probably didn't want to be suicided so he played along and bowed out.

What are those reasons as you know it?
this sub is very quickly turning into /r/greatawakening

its just things people make up now. its a picture of a cat and they call it a lion. 

one thing happened in one place, so therefore it must have also happened a bunch of other times in a bunch of other places to. 

one person committed a crime, so therefore this other person must have also committed the same crime, if not worse, because they have the same general job. theres no evidence of any kind to even hint that they did, but they have the same general job, so thats good enough.
Yeah, it is against code to have doors that can't be mechanically unlocked from the inside in case of power loss...especially when it's the only exit from a room in an officebuilding...don't buy this story
I wonder if you will feel that way if someone falsely accuses you of rape.
Considering the CIA makes false rape allegations to fuck people's life up, like Assange and Dominique Strauss-Kahn; I wouldn't be surprised if it stemmed from the unapproved questions to candidates.
who said it couldn't be mechanically unlocked with a key genius.
smoke and fire.

not legal.
The National Fire Protection Association’s (NFPA) Life Safety Code 101 says that in general every person within the building must be able to exit all doors in their path to the outside without “the use of a key, a tool, or special knowledge or effort for operation from the egress side” (NFPA 101, 7.2.1.5.2).  I'd be very surprised if NBC's risk management/insurers/the building owner let anyone, let alone of their big anchors, have an office that did not allow free egress in case of an emergency...
Good find.
Ha, well, they didn't seem to have a problem with multiple stars or talents breaking the law by *raping woman*, but no I'm sure you're right--surely having a door that's not easily unlocked is just *too* far.
Rape is indeed a horrible crime and often very traumatic.   You know what else is horrible?  A false rape allegation.  Those happen often too.  Duke Lacrosse Players is a great example of a corrupt and ambitious District Attorney deciding to break the law to railroad innocent young men.   Those students had their own faculty and much of the school turn on them and their coach.   No innocence until proven guilt.    More recently a woman who'd been arrested accused a cop of raping her.   Before her lie could be exposed the cop was being demonized online and his family threatened with the likes of Shaun King jumping on the bandwagon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Was talking to family in law enforcement and he told me that the majority of rape reports he takes prove to be false.  It's not always a woman lying to harm someone, sometimes it's a woman who doesn't understand what constitutes rape.   He said the last report he took was a couple hours.   The woman describe the perpetrator, her new boyfriend.   She described in detail the events leading up to the incident (a date and returning to his home).   She then explained that she was okay with him undressing her and elevating the encounter.   Family asks her, "Okay, so when did the rape take place?"  "Well once he was having sex with me, he was on top, and I was kind of in my own head and quiet, and it was ok at first, but then I didn't really like it as much and I kept sending him thought patterns to ask me if he should stop or pause, but he never got those." "Wait, you didn't ask him aloud to stop?" "No, I was just in a quiet mode."   "Ok, but then how would he know that you were withdrawing consent?" "Well, shouldn't he be able to sense that I wasn't that into it any more?" ------   Whoah, so did she seem a bit slow or....?  No, not slow, but wildly naïve and regretting sex with this guy, but there was no evidence of rape.  She wasn't drugged, wasn't forced, wasn't threatened, incapacitated etc..
I won't play a radical skeptic and ask you what we know regarding his firing, since about the only sources involved were nameless or corporate lackeys.   He was fired for inappropriate behavior.   This can be everything from off color jokes and a sexually charged atmosphere all the way up to rape and mass murder.   Maybe Matt Lauer has raped people, but the statute of limitations is long for rape so it's surprising nobody actually pursued such a thing against a high profile perpetrator with money for settlements.     I mean Stormy Daniels shook Trump down for $130,000 for a few minutes of consensual sex and then went on to cash in more.   I guess the thing nowadays is a lot of guys are crazy naive about just how wicked some women can be, especially when hooked up with ambulance chasing little sharks like Avenatti.
Yes. I would still feel sorry for the victims of actual rape even though I would hate whoever hypothetically falsely accused me. Anything else you're wondering?
I would like to paint another possibility that shows why Lauer was fired. 

[Sept. 8th, 2016 the Commander-In-Chief forum hosted by Lauer](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/commander-in-chief-forum). The guests were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 

[Oct. 29th, 2016 The Still Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NfFAaPZqs8) reports that Hillary had a melt down because Lauer asked her an unapproved question concerning her email server and threatened to get him fired. 

[Nov. 29th, 2017 NBC fires Lauer](https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/29/media/matt-lauer/index.html) for sexual harassment allegations. The clip linked here from CNN even leads the intro of the video with the Command-In-Chief forum either completely coincidental or subtly indicating the reason. I mean, there must be thousands of videos CNN with which they could have lead the video.

Summary:
I didn't see that in this article.
