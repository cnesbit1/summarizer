Congrats to your "Worlds second" guys!
Sadly anet stopped us with the disabled cm from getting a 100% legit kill at the release. We had the boss at 30% at 2am on tuesday/wednesday already then one dced, a lot of other guilds like sc or qT had the same problem. For the competition it was bad that anet didnt interrupted teapots group to keep it fair. But in the end they didnt claimed it as world first. They killed it like 8 am so 6hours later after our 30% tries.
I slightly disagree.

\- ANet stopping you implies an active act while truely it was a passive bug which kept you from finishing, though you had the chance to do it.  

\- By you saying "a 100% legit" kill implies \[SALT\] using bugs to clear the wing, which is simply wrong.

\- Whether or not you had the boss at 30% x hours earlier is doesnt matter at all since a) the wyvern phase is the hardest and b) ultimately you didnt kill it.

\- Whether or not one dced doesnt matter, you had the chance.

\- As this isnt a real competition, missing leaderboards and all that stuff, why would a company "stop" someone enjoying content. I can see the point tho, shit happens.

\- "They killed it 8 hours after our 30% tries, so their try doesnt count as we \*would\* have killed it before" is a sad mans arguement.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, by definition, "Worlds first CM" means fully clearing the wing \*FIRST\*. You cannot go around and tell everyone you did x-y-z first just because you yourself arent happy with the circumstances, the world doesnt work that way my friend. It might not be fair but thats reality.

&amp;#x200B;

So again, congrats to your "Worlds second", I mean it. :&gt;

I dont like how you imply something that i never said.
Its a very weak argument to tell us that we had the chance and that we could continue with 9. We would have tried it with 9 ppl but we didnt know that anet disabled the cm until we reloggt cause anet didnt communicated it, only teapots group got an ingame message of an anet dev that they should start the cm and keep it on. 
So we relogt cause a new patch was available and then we noticed the cm was disabled. 
I never said that teapots kill wasnt legit.
I think you dont know the full context behind it otherwise you wouldnt answer this way.
And the wyvern phase isnt that hard we just needed 1h to kill the boss after it got reactivated, its way harder to get into the bouncing fireball mechanic then to survive the wyvern phase.
Oh, im not implying anything, im merely pointing out facts to your poorly phrased comment. First and foremost, I infact do know the context and I wasnt arguing about fairness, since we can all agree that the situation wasnt fair, though thats not to blame on any participants and neither on ben, as it wasnt clear what ben meant until this whole thing emerged.

I was merely pointing out that objectively, whether or not you like it, \[SALT\] infact did the "Worlds first CM" clear.
Yea thats why it is called world first after cm was reactivated ;).
Oh cool, so me and my group got world's first CM aswell since apparently you can chose the point at which kills and clears are legit! Scratch that, everybody got worlds first! You get a world's first, and you, and you!

Well, that's really sad indeed.
test post Pog
So, using that wrong logic of yours, they surely aren't world second either, as the boss was surely killed by some means in cm during testing. But I guess you continue on believing your illusion of what is correct and whatnot.
You are indeed correct, as long as the boss resembled the actual boss as it is now, employing the same player given capabilities to be killed, which is, lets face it, questionable at best. 

The unfortunate thing is, they havent claimed it in terms of making actual proof of it available publically. So as it stands, \[SALT\] is the first guild to upload actual killproof which happens to be the first CM clear aswell, chronologically.

&amp;#x200B;

I do definitely not believe in "illusions", neither is my logic wrong. I can surely understand your subjective and probably emotionally triggered response. Unfortunately, you are trying to argue hard facts, which makes you look more than delusional my dear friend.
The level of arrogance in this one rofl

Summary:
You get a world's first, and you, and you!
