Hey, I'm making a living dex and currently on Johto but I'm missing these 2 pokemon to complete it :( if anyone has either of them in a basic pokéball then I'd appreciate it and I just want to breed one for myself then I'll trade it back to you :)
Can you help with another trade back if I end up doing this? I need Tapu Lele for my dex and can get a Girafarig for you. I'll trade the Lele back, I just need the dex entry.
Sure :) just gimme a moment and I'll add you and head to the plaza
Ok I need time to transfer it up to USUM as well. :)
That's fine :) I'll trade for the Girafarig and end the trade, breed one for myself then trade it you back for my lele, is that ok? :) I'll only breed it for the one egg
Absolutely fine with me :)
Thanks :) I'll let you know when I have the egg which should only be a few minutes and I'll trade it back :) just let me know when you're ready to trade!
I’m gonna be heading on FP now :)
Alright, I'll head there now then :)
Thanks for the Girafarig, I'll quickly breed an egg and trade it back to you :)
I’m gonna stay on FP until you’re done. Just send me a trade when you want to trade back :)
I'm done, heading back now :)
Can you send the request? You're not appearing on the list :(

Thanks for the help, I appreciate it :D

Summary:
:) I'll only breed it for the one egg.
I'll trade the Lele back, I just need the dex entry.
