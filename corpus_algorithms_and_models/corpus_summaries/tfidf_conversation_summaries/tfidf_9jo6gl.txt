You don't need to punish her.  You need to walk away.

Partners don't seek to hurt their SOs.  This relationship is broken beyond repair.  There is no getting even, only getting away.

Well, this. If you ever reach a point where you want to "punish" your SO, then the relationship isn't healthy anymore.

Got to agree. If your relationship is at a point where you need to punish your SO, then it's time to walk away. 

You both need to grow up. Also OP you are nearing 30. You should know better not to post things you wouldn't say in front of your boss online. Not in an account that can be easily traced back to you.  Employeers take that stuff a lot more seriously considering the political climate. 

If you're going to be an asshole. Don't be a dumb asshole.

Yeah, that’s the weirdest thing I’ve ever heard. You’re not her dad. You don’t get to ground her or take her phone away because she did something wrong.
From what i understand it wasnt a post, it was a private message to his girlfriend, someone he should trust.
He sent it to his gf via texting/chat. He did not post it online. That’s why he had her delete the chat history. This is why I have a huge issue with what she did - it wasn’t easily accessible. And she laughed at it. But then sent it to his boss - a screen shot of their private chat - to embarrass him and get him in trouble. I’d be a lot less mad if he’d posted it online on twitter or something.
Yup. This is “Eye for an eye makes the whole world go blind” territory. 

OP do you really feel that by making her cancel the trip, it will fix all your concerns with her? Will you trust her implicitly going forward?  Will she trust you and forcing her to cancel (which fixes nothing with your situation.  It isn’t making you whole)?

Summary:
You don't need to punish her.
You need to walk away.
You both need to grow up.
&gt;You don't need to punish her.
