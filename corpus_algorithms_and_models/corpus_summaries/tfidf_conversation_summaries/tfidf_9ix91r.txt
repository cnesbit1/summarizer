I kinda want to see Willy try to fight Parayko now.
I honestly wouldn't mind Wilson fight another one of your guys who are gooning it up.
Yeah, try. Nice one.
I wouldnt mind watchin willy beat his ass, absolutely.   Bunch of softies on the blues.

You are so precious.
“Oh my god, how dare a team respond to physical play!”
I know right, I can't believe how mad they got about a clean hit. Just go kiss your parents goodnight, go to bed and make sure you stay focused on school tomorrow.
“Clean”
Go back to your sub and check it out. Damn near 95% of your sub called it a clean hit and reputation call. But I understand, Wilson touched a guy so it automatically means it was dirty. Yet here you are crying about 1 hit, in a game filled with an entire team playing to injure someone.
No one is crying, we just disagree. I just think if you set a physical pace with borderline hits, don’t be surprised when it escalates.
His first hit came in the 2nd period against Munn, you guys had 6 or 7 hits by the end of the first. You remember all the after the whistle hits to the goalie, and running guys into the boards. Why do you think O' Brien fought whose his fuck, and still by then, Wilson hadn't thrown his hit on Dunn. You guys came out angry, playing like assholes, and want to cry about 1 hit that Wilson threw. Why dont you address the Blues playing like a drunk beer league team and how 1 guy is probably getting a phone call tomorrow.
Lol, No one is letting your players get away with that bullshit cup or no cup. Bort should and will get a call from the office. No one is disputing that. 
HOWEVER, No one hit the goalie, it was clearly going for the puck but I guess other teams aren’t allowed to play hockey. 
All ANYONE is saying, is that when you set a physical tone of play- it will be returned.  
You’re arguing a point no one is arguing.
Nighty night champ. Go push your agenda at your own sub
Lol

Summary:
No one is crying, we just disagree.
No one is disputing that.
You guys came out angry, playing like assholes, and want to cry about 1 hit that Wilson threw.
