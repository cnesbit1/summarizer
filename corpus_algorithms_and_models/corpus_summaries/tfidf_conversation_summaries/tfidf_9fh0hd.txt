Of course I want a Metagross, just like everyone else.

Unlike everyone else I'm offering custom saves for US or UM (Custom as in OT and language tags) for NA or PAL regions (2 saves for a save-managed Metagross, 3 saves for a stock Metagross). Other than that, I can offer RNG services for your saves (in case you can't/don't want to do it yourself), or custom RNG redeems; again on NA or PAL regions.

I can also offer custom shinies with either your TSV or my own ([OT]:Illaena [TID]:000000)

(Note, I can't read Korean or Chinese and haven't made Korean or Chinese saves yet; I can play through the game fine but you'll have to explain how to input the OT you want if you want custom saves)

I also have 2018 Legends Zygardes for trade, Adamant &amp; Jolly (ENG tagged, self redeemed, at least 5 IV).
/u/PkmnRedTom can I interest you in anything I have on offer?
I'd like to know if you could do a Custom Shiny TSVs! :) 

If you can do, could you do these 2 for me? :) 

#1. Charmander 
Ball: Fast Ball 
Nature: Adamant 
Gender: Male 
Egg moves: Dragon Dance 
TSV: 4091

#2: Froakie
Ball: Moon Ball
Nature: Mild 
Gender: Male 
Egg moves: none 
TSV: 4091 

These are the ones I want you to do if you can!
Yeah, I can do that. I'd RNG them with PCalc, NTR and 3DSRNGTool. So 2 shinies for a Metagross? I could send you a save to receive it on so I can redeem it myself if that's okay with you!
I don't think I'll be receiving the save if you meant by Cartridge since I am doing this secretly from my mother and I don't have a foreign 3ds available... 

And my 3ds doesn't have a CFW on it...
Aah, alright! I'll let you know when I finish those two Eggs for you~
Sorry I forgot to include the Ability for Froakie! 

Protean Please! :)
And do you want Charmander to have Blaze or Solar Power?
Blaze, please!
Alright! If you want more shinies, I'd be up for getting more Metagross haha
I'm here again to add one More Metagross for trade! :)

And that's it for my request! :D
Alright 2 last questions; what IV spread do you want for Froakie (I'm assuming you want VVVXVV for Charmander cause of the Adamant nature) and what Flabebe color do you want?
Yup Charmander with VVVXVV

Red color would be a color for Flower! :D
And the Froakie spread?
VXVVVV is the best known! :)
Alright, will do!
And by the way, is it okay if I add more shinies for the existing Metagross? 

I had been a confusion somehow that I messed the whole rates and I'm trying to fix! 

(3 per Metagross, not that much different right? :D)
Yeah that's fine, I was thinking about saying that myself haha
#5. Froakie 
- ability: Protean 
- Nature: Modest

Here's the total of 6 for 2 Metagross! :D
Alright! So only the Flabebe on a different TSV, right?
Yes that is correct! 

The Flabebe is a gift for a friend of mine and he has the different one! :)
Alright!
Hi! 

Do you need any specific date and Language? :) 

I'm taking your proof video now but I don't know what dates and Language tags for your Metagross! 

My phone is about to die so I won't be able to see your comment after 30 minutes. 

Please answer me quickly! :D
Korean, and today's date for both, please!
The eggs are all finished!

Are you still here?! :)
Yep! I've got you added already so I'm going online to the Plaza!
Send me a trade request whenever!
I can't see you :( 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it because I took it so long to ACTUALLY going online? (My 3ds had a problem getting Online for 20 minutes)
An error occured, re-trade me whenever! I still have 4 eggs to give you!
Sorry My 3ds is running crazy somehow :( 

It just disconnected when I was out for some talk with my family, I'll try to be online as soon as I can!
I just became online again! :D ]

I hope it doesn't get error again...
That's all of them, trade complete! Thanks for the Metagross!

Summary:
Yeah, I can do that.
So 2 shinies for a Metagross?
I just became online again!
If you want more shinies, I'd be up for getting more Metagross haha.
I'd like to know if you could do a Custom Shiny TSVs!
I'm here again to add one More Metagross for trade!
:) 

If you can do, could you do these 2 for me?
