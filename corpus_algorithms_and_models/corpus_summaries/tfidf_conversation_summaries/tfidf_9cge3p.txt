Article doesn’t elaborate on the $75 payment. Starchy clickbait maggot food.

However the fact that sexual assaults is rising on airlines is daft. What the fuck people. Keep your hands in your pockets
That’s a tough way to masturbate.
Cut a hole in your pocket like a civilized human being.
If you have time could you sketch a “how to” for the process?
For science of course
A simple video demonstration would work too.
As airfare gets more affordable, different classes of people are able to travel.
Step 1:  Cut a hole in the ~~box~~ pocket.
Some cultures just masturbate in public; check your white privilege United Airlines
Kinda sad tho
Just git gud
Without actually researching or looking into it whatsoever, I'm going to assume that sexual assaults on planes isn't actually increasingly and that the increase is due to increased reporting and escalation of consequences for perpetrators. Meaning that in the past, people may have just received a warning for inappropriate behavior and it would go unreported, whereas now the same action would warrant an arrest/report, resulting in a percieved increase.

Do you have a source for your suggestion that sexual assault rates differ by class? I think without it, this comment sounds very elitist.
Haha

Or call him out. I’m sure if you made a scene there would be literally no one supporting the guy on the plane. Even film him and let everyone know it’s going viral.

I suppose yea. That would be great if all the good samaritans weren’t also being charged with battery or assault for punching creeps
