Original Response:
My period started. It was unexpected. I didn’t pack and tampons because it’s a quick trip and I haven’t had a period in a year- thanks Nexplanon. 

But then it happened. And I sat in the bathroom, panicking. Do I shove toilet paper in my panties? 

And then there were feet in the stall next to me. 

“Hey - I know this is weird, but do you have a tampon?” 

You didnt. 

But you did leave the bathroom, find a quarter, come back, buy me a tampon, and pass it under the stall. 

I never saw your face but you’re my hero today. 

This small act of kindness is part of why I love being a woman.
I’ve never been asked for one before or to go get some for them (I’m a guy). But because of general curiosity if a girl asks me to go get her some from the store is there a certain brand or kind I should get? Like which ones are the Cadillac of tampons?
