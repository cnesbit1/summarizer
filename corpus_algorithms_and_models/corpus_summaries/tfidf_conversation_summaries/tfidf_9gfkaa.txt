Original Response:
I live in PA meaning it is pretty much impossible to ride during the winter, so I was wondering if i should take the MSF course before it gets super cold, or wait until the spring.
I took mine in the summer (southwest PA) and it was so annoying because you aren't moving much and just sweat constantly. Would have loved to take it in the winter. Go for it! 

I normally store the bike after the first throw of salt but have been known to take a quick ride during the winter months. Hell a couple years ago when I still had my ninja 250 I remember riding on Christmas day as it was about 60Â°
I remember that day also. Really awesome.
I think it was back in 2016. I was so hyped to ride that day. The perfect Christmas present!
We went out and shot slingshots at ornaments. Some of the ornaments that we didn't hit are still out there to this day.
Vandalism is totes sweet...  /s
We put them up on trees, and shot them.
Lol the way you worded and how I read it made me think you shot others ornaments. 

Apologies.
No, that would be stupid :P
Agreed haha
Took mine mid-May in MD and it was brutal. It was only like 80-ish degrees, but sitting in the middle of a parking lot on top of a 200 degree oven makes it feel waaaay hotter. Then the heat leads to fatigue and fatigue makes the simple stuff way harder.

Summary:
I was so hyped to ride that day.
I remember that day also.
