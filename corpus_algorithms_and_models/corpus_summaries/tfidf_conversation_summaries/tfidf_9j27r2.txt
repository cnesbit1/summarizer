Original Response:
## Dear Binance u/Jager_Binance,

3 weeks ago you blocked my account and after a long conversation because of my “security issue”, still nothing. 

My account is 3rd level verified, allowing me to take out more than 100 Bitcoins per day, the account isn’t inactive or suspicious. As soon as I noticed my account was frozen, I applied to have it unfrozen, but then you cancelled that and responded me with documents request and I gave you at least five documents you asked for in order to verify it was really me and even had a more than hour-long video call with you. 

I’ve done everything you’ve asked by the strong deadlines you’ve given, and then you just ignore me and don’t answer me at all. I can’t get any information from you about the process of unblocking my account and you still have all of my money; I can’t get any of it back. Could you please answer me and give me a reason for all of this? 

Everything you’ve said to this point hasn’t been true or according to your rules. I’d really appreciate some clarity and some answers.

u/Jager_Binance 

**What I’d like to know is, what is the real reason for blocking my account? Please PM me!**

**Why are you ignoring me? Could you comment on this? Why do I have to make all these things public just to attract your attention?**  

**P.S.**

That was an official Binance answer before they blocked me in their official subreddit

u/Jager_Binance I have already provided EVERYTHING you have requested and more! Why are you still ignoring me after 2 weeks of conversations? You’ve given me no choice but to make it public. 3 messages without any reply!

Dear u/Jager_Binance, so you think that a user repeatedly posting on reddit because of you is not going to help? It HELPS my friend, it HELPS a lot. it HELPS to put in public shame your company. Locking the thread hoping to contain the damage is not going to help either.... So you'd better reply to the user with a meaningful answer... Welcome to the Internet.
Thanks for support! And be careful with your money on exchanges
no problem! your keys your bitcoins, not your keys not your bitcoins :-)
Rule 0
Wonder why so few start to count at zero. I guess you are a software developer?
Almost! IT Systems Administrator who uses basic scripting to automate my repetitive tasks.

I use Rule 0 as a term whenever there's a rule you should always remind yourself of.
Jager should really be more forthcoming in this situation.

I feel way less comfortable now, leaving my money on Binance, after seeing how a customer is being treated that stated he didn´t get proper help from the customer support.

I never had trouble with Binance, but situations like these will pop up often in the future. And if not handled properly, people can and will lose trust.

Like the japanese saying:

*For want of a nail the shoe was lost,*

*for want of a shoe the horse was lost,*

*for want of a horse the knight was lost,*

*for want of a knight the battle was lost,*

*for want of a battle the kingdom was lost.*

*So a kingdom was lost—all for want of a nail.*


Treat this god damn mans situation more polite u/Jager_Binance

Not only for his sake, but also for Binance sake.
Bingo.  This hits the nail on the head.

Jager unequivocally failed at customer service here.  CZ needs to have a serious chat with him to fix this, for Binance's sake.  This is where the rubber mets the road; will Binance step up and demonstrate the credibility, responsibility, and integrity they claim to have and so prolifically tweet about?
Not to mention that this issue strikes at the very heart of the concerns about centralized exchanges.  If Binance (and all other centralized exchanges) don't rectify this, and other issues like it, as quickly, cleanly, and responsibly as possible, with utmost integrity, it will mark the true beginning of the end for the centralized exchanges due to further erosion of trust.  People already know centralized exchanges aren't a great idea when it comes to crypto, but there just aren't many options out there right now, usually due to the lack of volume on those decentralized exchanges (at least for traders / speculators).  This type of issue is a crucial watermark for the industry and will be scrutinized more in the future by the crypto community.  In this case, with great *trust* (from all your users) comes great responsibility, Jager, and CZ.  I suspect CZ knows this, but it is time to put your money where your mouth is.  Literally.
OP has been scammed and is refusing to accept this fact. It has nothing to do with binance. He has posted multiple posts saying he has done skype video chats with "binance support" and refuses to post email headers confirming it was actually binance who told him to talk to them through skype.

Binance doesnt do skype support. He has been giving all his personal information, including his face on webcam, to scammers, and now he's blaming binance.

It is very unfortunate this happened to OP, but repeatedly trying to shame binance for something they are not at fault for will accomplish nothing.

Edit: **Ever since OP had that skype call two weeks ago there has most likely been multiple different people with every last bit of his personal information trying to get binance to unfreeze that account.** He should be doing whatever the fuck he can to keep that account frozen instead he has posted 6 posts on 3 different subreddits saying binance stole his money. If his account has been kept frozen for this time he should be thanking binance profously yet here is doing all he can to give binance bad publicity instead of listening to all the people telling him what he did wrong so that he might help binance move forward with this.

OP you needed to start doing damage control 2 weeks ago. You need to create a new email. The scammers not only have all your personal information you gave them, they know what email adress you use. You also should never again use or create an exchange account linked to any of those documents you sent them. **If youre using any other exchanges get your money out of there now.**
&gt; Jager should really be more forthcoming in this situation.

Should simply be sacked. Their way of dealing with people is not conducive to the job description.
&gt; CZ needs to have a serious chat with him to fix this

*"You're fired"* Simple.
