I can get you HA Treecko, Mudkip, Piplup and Tepig

Treecko and Mudkip are in Dream Balls, Tepig is in a Level Ball and Piplup is just in a Pokeball

You'll have to give me a little while to breed them, maybe 20 mins max

In return I'd be interested in Love Ball HA Grimer and Cutiefly, Fast Ball HA Mudbray, and Dream Ball HA Growlithe

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you're interested and I'll get to breeding :)
Yes! Just lmk when you got them and we’ll trade :)
Sweet, I'll get started   \^\_\^

&amp;#x200B;

Forgot to mention, All but piplup will come with 4 egg moves and their best nature
That is fine! All 4 of the pokemon you requested will also have best natures, and all but grimer will come with 4 egg moves.
Ok, I'm good to go. Sorry that took so long, I had to take a call midway through getting the Pokemon ready  :P

Edit: and it also took longer then I thought it would XD
It’s fine :) i can trade now if you want!
Ok cool, I'll add you and head to plaza :)
Added you! In plaza now
Thank you for the trade, enjoy the Pokemon :)
Thank you also!
I can breed one of these for you:

| Pokémon | Nature | Ability | IVs | Egg Moves | Poké Ball |
|---------|--------|---------|:---:|-----------|-----------|
| Totodile | Adamant | **Sheer Force** | 31/31/31/x/31/31 | Ancient Power, Dragon Dance, Hydro Pump, Ice Punch | [](/pokeball) Poké Ball |

I'm mainly interested in Grimer and Growlithe, could you give me more info on them?
Hey if that offer is still available, I’m interested. Here’s some info on Grimer and Growlithe

Alolan Grimer:
• Love Ball
• 5 perfect IVs (HP-Pretty good)
• HA Power of Alchemy
• 3 egg moves: Power-Up Punch, Shadow Sneak, and Curse
• Nature: Adamant
• Gender: Male
• OT: Maya

Growlithe:
• Dream Ball
• 4 perfect IVs (Attack-Very Good, Speed-Pretty Good)
• HA Justified
• 4 egg moves: Burn Up, Morning Sun, Double-Edge, and Close Combat
• Nature: Jolly
• Gender: Male
• OT: Maya

If you would like all perfect 6 IVs i can try breeding it for you. Lmk if you’re still interested.
If you could make 31/31/31/x/31/31 Grimer, 31/31/31/x/31/31 Growlithe or 31/x/31/31/31/31 Growlithe work, i would make that trade.
sure i can, i will let you know when i have them

edit: also are the natures they have alright with you?
I have Dittos, so whichever Nature is most convenient for you works ;)

Just to make sure, the wording of your comment confused me a little, any one of them works. So any Growlithe is porbably gonna be the easiest choice for you.
hey sorry, im not going to have much time on my hands and the best ive gotten today was a 31/x/31/31/31/29 growlithe. If you don’t want to trade i totally understand, but i just don’t want to waste your time.
You're right, i wouldn't trade for that one, sorry. But really i'm in no rush to trade, so if you want to trade in a few days or so, let me know.
hey i just got it! lmk when you can trade :)
I'll probably be around in about ten hours. Let me know if that works for you.
not too sure if i can do in 10 hours, can you do right now?
Maybe in half an hour, i'll let you know.
I could trade now if that works for you.
Yes, just added you
Cool. I'm in Plaza, you can request a trade when you're ready.
Thanks for trading!
Thank you!

Summary:
