Original Response:
Addressing a claim in the article - Inflation doesn't only help the rich and the governments - inflation helps everyone by decreasing the real value of that debt.

If the first year you make $2, have $2 debt, and need to spend $1 to live it will take two years to pay off the debt.

If next year there were 100% inflation you would make $4, have $1 debt, and need to spend $2 to live, resulting in you having $1 left over instead of $0.

That's the super-simplified concept, anyway.
Yeah, it is super-simplified concept and does not actually apply to the real physical world.

Lets say I make a contract with you that I give you one of my honey jars now and after two years you give me back two jars of equal size and quality as the one I gave you.

Even you sold the original honey jar then how is inflation going to help you?


What also happens is that any normal loans disapear out of the market and you get price or inflation indexed loans or loans with high rate only.
No, it benefits the rich for two reasons.

The first one is explained in the article.

The second reason is that when money is printed, it is made available to banks and corporations before it trickles down to the rest of the population.  Hence, banks and corporations can purchase assets cheaper than the rest, that is, before said printing inflates the price of these assets.
Why would I make a contract with you where you give me one honey jar and then I have to give you two honey jars next year?

What incentive do I have to make this deal?

Real goods in a bartering system are different than trade in a monetized system.
I didn't say it doesn't benefit the rich, I just said it benefits debtors as well.

That 30 year fixed mortgage is going to be easier to pay off towards the end of a 30 year run of 2% inflation if your real wages have not changed.

Another way of saying this is inflation punishes people who live within their means and accrue savings and rewards people abusing credit to live a lavish lifestyle they can’t afford. 


Cue: consumerism, corporatism, crony capitalism, and a wage-slave population where [63% of people can’t pay for a $500 emergency without going into debt](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/).

that's a big if.
I mean I can't really tell you what real wages will do going forward but they've been pretty stagnant since the mid 70's.
I agree with this wholeheartedly. The system is designed to encourage indebtedness.
But the rates on your loans go up with inflation too; they price it in.
I mean, yeah, but it depends on when you get it and what kind you get.
&gt;I just said it benefits debtors as well.

The rich have significantly more opportunity to actually use and abuse debt. Multi-million dollar lines of credit when you're very wealthy. A $5,000 credit card when you're not. Maybe some high interest loans. Not even close to the same benefit.

Summary:
