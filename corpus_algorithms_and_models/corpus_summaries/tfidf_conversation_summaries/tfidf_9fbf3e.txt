Can you contact the colleague and have her explain this to your wife?  Especially the violin.  She'll think you're still lying, but at least it's something.  

You **are** telling the truth, right?
Yeah I'm telling the truth. I don't think it would be professional to bring a coworker i dont know well into this.
She brought herself in by dropping her garbage in your car. She could drop it at the airport.

Also, how did your wife come to the small garbage bag that is in the car that only you drive? Was she fishing for something?
I keep the garbage bag in the car for that purpose, for trash. It's not like my coworker did something wrong.

She said she was cleaning my car and saw a receipt on top of the trash, for a women's clothing store
&gt;You  
&gt;  
&gt;are  
&gt;  
&gt;telling the truth, right?

I questioned if he was telling the truth too as I was reading the post. Thinking: maybe he's hoping his wife will "stumble" upon this thread and then believe him. Maybe I got some trust issues myself xD

But to be fair, everything you posted sounds extremely suspicious and incriminating. That is a TON of receipts that your colleague left in your car. Does she not have a trash bin at home?! Who just throws their trash in other people's car bins like that?

Anyways, I don't think you should feel bad about bringing your coworker into this situation. Although it might be a little embarrassing for you and inconveniencing to your colleague, that's a small price to pay to save your marriage and regain your wife's trust. Or give her your phone and show that there's no strange messages/calls between you and your colleague and explain to her that if you did go on so many dates and such, there would be some contacting involved which would show on your phone. That may ease her mind a little too.
So you are going to possibly choose divorce rather than ask a co-worker to clear up a mis-undertanding?  

From here it doens't look like you are are telling the truth, which is why you don't want your co-worker involved, just saying how it looks.
She sure thought she knew you well enough to dump all her receipts in your trash.
In OPs defense....I know people who dump their shit in my car all the fucking time.
If you don't know her well why does she feel comfortable cleaning out her purse in your car? Tbh I'm with your wife, this is very suspicious
How is this suspicious? She had nothing else to do but ride in the car, and they were on their way out of town, and he had a trash bag right there. I'd want a clean purse on a business trip, too, but it's the kind of thing I wouldn't think to do until I was sitting there with my purse and nothing to do.
Is this a private activity? Do people only do this behind closed doors? How close is it to masturbating?

everything about it is suspicious.   he was also on the trip, but drove to the airport instead of all of them expensing a cab/uber/lyft.

He also doenst want to bring in the 3rd or 4th person that was in the car during this trip.


He implies there were more than 2, but doesnt want any other party corroborate his story.


Also the amount of receipts indicates there were a lot, which makes me question how big the trash bag was and why he didnt empty it when it was full.


Also he is more concerned about his image to his coworkers than his relationship with his wife.  


Every single thing he has said and done are the actions of a guilty man.
I dont think he's telling the truth... what are the odds that both he AND his "coworker" only pay in cash all the time (Like literally? All the receipts? Not ONE was paid in card?)

And he can't bring in his coworker because he's more invested in his professional image to a 22-year-old than his marriage? Which, btw, he didn't realize she was emptying his purse in his car? That's very rude to dump your garbage in a colleague's car who you "dont know well" without asking first.

Methinks OP is looking to crowdsource and solidify his excuse.

What??? It's trash! Nothing means less than a trash bag. No one assumes someone will later go through a trash bag. It's trash!!

christ on crystal meth.    Yes, OP.   Use my exact language and phrasing when interacting with your coworker.

Infact when you are done, why not punch her in the face as well?   because that will trigger the shit out of idiots on the internet that cannot understand sarcasm.
See my other response to this comment.
Agree. Good analysis. You certainly do "sea" implications...
oh yeah I completely missed that part. Who pays for a violin in cash? That shit is like thousands of dollars. You can't even withdraw that much money from an ATM unless you do it over several days... which who would go through the trouble of doing that instead of using a credit card or check?? Someone who is trying to buy a violin for their secret mistress that's who...
It's rude to empty your purse into a stranger's trash in their car.
His co-worker put trash in his trash bin... Is that some huge social faux pas where you live? It's his wife that is the crazy one digging through bins. Some people here are apparently so sure OP is cheating that they will justify anything
Exactly. It's probably the thing that is going to be hardest for OP to spin. There is absolutely no reason to buy a violin (many hundreds to thousands of dollars) with cash unless (a) you've earned the money illegally; or (b) you're making a deliberately hidden purchase for your mistress.

Where OP "fcked up" is by not hiding the receipts - but cheaters can be surprisingly stupid.
yes.   where I live putting trash in other peoples bin is the ultimate sin.   People have lost heads for it.    the last case of bin dumping went to the supreme court because clearly thats the main issue in this thread.
Why not just throw the receipts away at the airport though, rather than leave them in someone’s car?
yeah, honestly this is weird.
I don’t see how it’s crazy? When I’m taking out the trash, sometimes I see what’s on top. Usually it’s my own thing, but if I saw something out of the ordinary, I would probably look at it, too.
AND, who throws out a receipt for a violin?  Don't they come with some kind of warranty?  Wouldn't you want the receipt just in case?
Would you throw away a receipt for a brand new violin?  Wouldn't you potentially need to keep that shit?
She didn't leave them in someone's car, she left them in a garbage bag!

Even OP says that his garbage bag is there for garbage. I seriously had no idea that there were such rigid rules about garbage besides, 'Don't put food garbage in a paper-only garbage can'?
I wouldn't, but it sounds like this person did.
Sounds like husband is lying and set up this post hoping his wife would find it.  Now he's getting called out.
you knew her well enough to drive her to the airport in your car.

You could have expensed the cab ride to the airport, but went out of the way to drive there and giver her a ride.

And many clothing stores have the store name in large bold letters, so if she was familiar with the store it would be immediately noticeable.
This pitchfork train is ridiculous. I pay many things in cash. A younger colleague is also less likely to have credit cards. And there are plenty of affordable violins within a typical cash budget.
My first thought was the coworker has the hots for OP and was trying to set up problems in his marriage.  

I think I spend too much time on this sub.


(My second thought was, who the hell puts paper receipts in the trash instead of recycling them?!)
the moment i started reading this post something about it rubbed me the wrong way. everything about it is WAY too convenient, and i'd absolutely be suspicious if i was his wife. the scenario is just bizarre.
Who keeps *that* many reciepts in their purse, with the goal of just throwing them all away anyway? Especially as you say, for things you'd want to keep a reciept for? It seems weird to me, too.
You're not going to get a usable violin for less than several hundred dollars.

You would pay for a multiple hundred dollar purchase in cash? If so, why?

She doesn't need a credit card. Everyone I know pays via debit card. If she has a bank account, which she does, she will have a debit card. I haven't seen anyone pay for anything over £20 - 30 in cash for around a decade.

If you can't see what's happening here I'm afraid you're very naïve.
I mean, to be fair I do that. People hand me a receipt, I shove it in my purse. Every couple of months I get annoyed enough by how many receipts there are in there and clean it all out at once. What's suspicious to me is that it sounds like almost all the receipts are "affair" ish. If this was just normal purse cleaning, where are the receipts for groceries or single meals from McDonald's or whatever?
Suck it up and do it. If it's innocent then there would be no problem. If you can't do it then you're lying.
The phone thing might be too late. She will just think hes had time to delete everything.

I agree that its pretty damning. Especially if he wasnt at home during these times. But i will say that my friends regularly leave their trash in my car. Some are nice enough to put it in the grocery bag i have for trash, but others have no issue putting it in my cupholder hole or floors.
If she didn't do anything wrong and it's as innocent as you say then what's the problem with asking her to corroborate your simple story? Unless there is no coworker and you're using that excuse to hide your mistress.
Same. Although, I would think that OP’s wife would be reasonable enough to not use this one incident as her basis for feeling the way she does.

There must be other reasons/actions that have lead up to this point and this just serves as “proof”.

Or she is just crazy untrusting &amp; suspicious , but I see no reason to assume that from the information above.

Also, I don’t know anyone who pays for drinks at a bar, with cash, and gets a receipt.  Unless she was doing her expense account in OP’s car.

I know several people that withdraw cash for large purchases. Hell my dad has paid for things upwards of 3 grand in cash. My friend bought something for 5 grand in cash. It amazes me that in a world of billions of people, obviously some pitchfork and torch redditor absolutely **knows** that not one person buys expensive things with cash unless its illegal or theyre banging a side piece. 

I mean youre saying "Two people something in cash!? Fucking cheater!"
[removed]
Ok but are these people taking business trips? Not in those industries
Oh, please. My purse is a black hole where receipts go to die. Most places around here print them automatically, so the cashier hands them to me and I have to just shove 'em in my purse and get out of the way, because if I try to say "no receipt please" they'll get all flustered and I'll hold up the line. Every few weeks I dump out my purse and throw out *dozens* of flattened, compacted receipts. By the time I'm cleaning it out, it's about 40% receipts, used Kleenex, and Larabar wrappers.
It's not just that.

It's also that he's unwilling to have any of several people travelling in his car corroborate his story to save his marriage. And apparently doesn't have a single text, photo, email or other record to prove he was with his wife at the time the purchases were made. And conveniently has his location tracking turned off. His tone in the responses is not typical from someone falsely accused. And the idea that this woman would store multiple receipts from different days, decide to not keep an important one (for a violin) and be emptying her purse in his car is a little odd.

Yeah he could not be a cheater. I'm just saying that based upon all of the above information it seems likely that he is.

My intuition is imperfect but when friends or relatives or myself have been cheated on, I've been able to accurately call it every single time. And I'm calling it here.

Out of interest, why have your friends and relatives chosen to pay for stuff costing thousands in cash by the way? Why not make a bank transfer or pay with a card? It's just not something I've ever encountered before.

Your last thought is exactly what I’m thinking. How do you not notice someone sitting beside you cleaning out their handbag of massive amounts of rubbish? Also, how does driving people to the airport not come up in your daily,  “Hey honey, how was your day” conversation?
To me, the violin makes the most sense. Might just be personal experience, but I found out the hard way that at least some credit unions limit you to $1,000/day using a debit card. It was a very embarrassing situation and since then I've always gone to the bank to withdraw cash (in person) for major purchases like that. Not saying OP can't be lying, but I can understand a lot of this. I also use cash for day to day purchases other than gas to keep myself accountable. Let's not leap to conclusions here when there's no real evidence of foul play.
I also have a ton of receipts in my purse and do a purge every once in a while, but not in someone else's trash can. I wouldn't say it's rude but it is kind of embarrassing for the person purging because you may be finding some gross stuff like a half-wrapped jolly rancher or, idk, a condom receipt. I would not leave that in anyone's trash can but my own. Also a car is not a good place to do this purge because if you have that many receipts you probably have a bunch of other stuff floating around your purse, like pens, ID badges, lip gloss, clutch, etc that you have to empty out in order to really do an effective purge. Not something you do in a moving car belonging to someone you barely know
Yes, moving people DRIVE to their destinations. They don't go to the airport
Do you use location tracking on your phone? With Google, you can look up your location history by date and time. Compare to the receipts. 

Those receipts, by themselves, in this exact situation, would seem questionable for a lot of people. Is your wife a jealous person? Do either of you have a history of infidelity that would cause her to jump so swiftly and completely to this accusation?
I use apple maps, I don't know if it saves my location but i will look

She does tend to be insecure but this is the first time she's jumped to conclusions like this
Google "APPLE MAPS LOCATION HISTORY" for a how to. Location services may have to have been on for it to work.
&gt; Significant Locations settings’ are buried pretty deep. You’ll find them in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services &gt; System Services &gt; Significant Locations. You must authenticate yourself to see them, using your passcode, Touch ID or Face ID. Once you’re in, you’ll see a list of the towns and cities you have visited. Each one will have the number of sub-locations, and the date or date range of your visits.
Yeah, this looks suspicious for sure, but your description of the exchange sounds a whole lot like she was looking for excuses to "catch" you. Even if you manage to prove innocence, good luck with rebuilding trust.
I had the location tracking turned off in one of my settings. damn

Lol, what are the odds
This is both generally terrifying and yet comforting in case I go missing.
Both. Definitely both. My close friends and I share our location in real time via Google, for hanging out but also safety reasons.
Receipts have dates and times on them, and movies / dinners /shopping take up quite a long time, so you'd probably be home for at least some of them. 

Your phone company could have saved call logs or texts logs too. I know mine are given with my monthly bill accessible online. Show her those. 

Another thing: things on the list are pretty expensive. maybe show her that you wouldn't have the money to cheat? (E.g. do a budget thing, show her how much money you have left in your wallet).
