Oh no, someone dares to question the precious cultural left.  The very idea...
&gt;”She was not just fat. I mean to tell you what: I think she pumped iron probably an hour or so a day,” he said of the woman. “She literally could have played guard for the Green Bay Packers.”

Very Christian of him. Where is this cultural left you’re whining about?
Being morbidly obese is a sin.

Can you prove that claim?
Dude that’s just been how thoroughly subverted this sub is. Just scroll the comments with your eyes glazed over to catch the usual buzzwords. This seriously is the gutter you should pass by on your way to do some real spiritual reading. I stop in to see such train wrecks as the 50th “I’m gay and it’s ok” post or about “starting a conversation” concerning the patriarchy/white supremacy.

For fucks sake my man, some mods here are openly gay atheist. What did you expect?
I don't have to.  Do your own research.  This is an unremarkable claim.
No place is obesity in itself described as sin.
You can be morbidly obese without gluttony and you can be a glutton without morbid obesity.

Shame on people who use sin as a proxy for their own prejudices.

Additionally, do you believe pastors should be mocking sinners at the pulpit?

Morbid obesity is almost always caused by overeating and a lack of physical activity and saying so is not a prejudice.

No individual was called out by name as i understand the article, it's just that the precious cause goons need something about which to be outraged.

The left is a sewer.

Failing to care for one's body is, which is exactly what obesity is.
Yes, bad behavior should be condemned though the individual shouldn't be named, which they were not in this case. 

What's next? Shall we ignore pederasty, adultery, murder, violence?  how about homosexuality which is explicitly forbidden in the texts? Oh wait, we're already allowing that without comment. Would that be shaming someone?

let's be honest, Christianity in particular and the broader culture as a whole no longer has the vaguest notion of Shame. Instead,  everything is buried under the left Progressive pile of social justice pieties.  real principle left the building decades ago and its place we have people rewriting the texts to suit their desired social outcomes.   the result is a so-called Christian Church that has abandoned foundational Christian theology, and a larger culture that is bereft of any morality.
I agree with you but, even if it is voluntary, it can be something that people struggle with, that happens to be visible. Most people who are obese don't want to be, and would prefer not to be. Even if they eat too much. An alcoholic who is trying to quit but can't is probably not going to get called out and laughed at from the pulpit.

With regard to obesity, people will just flat out make fun of people, like this guy, even if someone is struggling with it.

Ultimately it's about secular prejudice. People like this pastor and the person I'm talking to just want to use Christianity to bully people, but it's not remotely coming from their perception of God. Hate is their god.
This is a good summary of how we \*try\* to moderate 1.3.
This and the rest of this chain is just badly disguised racism.

Please consider this a warning for 1.3 and I'd ban you for this if your account was newer.
The rule itself doesn't really give any indicator of that, and regardless it requires quite a bit of speculation. :/
You should show love and kindness to your brother/sister in Christ. If they are sinning, inform them of it and help them to overcome it through positive love and support.

Shaming, condemnation, and fear aren't what Jesus asked us to do. Fear in particular (not the respect kind God asks from us, we're talking the other hide under your bed from monsters and anxiety kind) is Satan's, and he uses it to control and tempt. If any of your methods even slightly resemble this, then it means you're serving the adversary and not my holy father. If you are unwilling to show love and forgiveness to the least of these, if you're not willing to sacrifice time to help them, but instead tell the poor of willpower to depart and be fed without giving them a single morsel, you have not done the same for my brother. If this is you, then you will not see my Father, and my King will turn you away.
You have GOT to be kidding.  Please do spell out the covert racism your advanced detection methods have cleverly exposed ... You know  the ones no one else can see...
It is not that simple. That's just one possibility out of several.
This is a story about a great conservative hero, extremely indulgent of rapists (hey, boys will be boys), while using the pulpit to mock a woman for being insufficiently hawt.

And from that, your take-away is somehow "liberals have no values".

Okay.
Mocking a woman for her appearance has nothing to do with worrying about her health.

What he's doing is reminding the congregation in Jesus' name that women exist to be leered at, that committing adultery in your heart is the right of every man, and any woman who takes the fun out of it deserves scorn.
Nice try.  SJW nonsense.
