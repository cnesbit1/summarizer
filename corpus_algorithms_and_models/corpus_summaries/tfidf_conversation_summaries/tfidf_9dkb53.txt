Whishlist for now (feel free to offer something else but this is what I'm after the most right now) 

* Fuura Lugia codes
* NA Latios/Latias codes
* 20th Anniversary pokemon (With benefitial nature and proof).
* VC Celebi codes
* VGC Krook
* Other Worlds/VCG Events.

**I could potentially offer PAL latios/latias redeems (redeemed myself from the 2018 legends event), depending on the offers.**

Comming up at some point: Gen4-7 RNG's, Manaphy RNG, Colo/XD Rng, Ageto Celebi/Pikachu RNG, Wishmaker RNG and after some extra tests I will add Channel RNG again

If anyone have any question / concern, please feel free to discuss with me in comments or IRC. 

The current services I have for trade are the following:

**Hayley Mew/Phione/Pokemon:**

* Self-Obtained, OT: Eulalia (since I use Spanish version of the game), ID: 01000, random nature (normal pokemon have set nature,levels, pokeballs, moveset)
* Hayley collection includes: 20 pokemon + Mew + Phione, if anyone is interested in them let me know.

**CHANNEL Jirachi:**

* Done on retail .
* Selt-Obtained, OT: CHANNEL,  ID: 40122, SPA Tag, Random Nature.

**Generation 3 RNG / Move tutoring**

* Legendaries, wild, safari, anything in general you can think of
* Information I will need: IV spread, nature, nickname, pokeball, nickname, etc. I can start a save with your OT and maybe your desired ID, but won't always happens, will depend on the offer.
* RNG will be done on PC (Emulator) with LUA scripts, all of them will have SPA tag (might soon be offering ENG/JPN tagged ones), all of them are self-obtained.
* For move tutoring: If you need a special pokemon with any tutor move only from gen3 I can do it for you, some of the most desired ones are: Mimic Shedinja, Soft-Boiled Clefairy or Togepi, Seismic Toss Registeel, etc

Are Pokemon in your events tab for trade?  If so, how many L/L codes are you looking for a lvl 100 Adamant Entei and lvl 100 Timid Raikou?
Yes event tab is for thread and it would be 3 codes each.
Okay.  Can I reserve the timid Raikou (#14) and adamant Entei (#16) on your list?  I'm still gathering codes and will hopefully get enough by the weekend.
Sure, I will reserve those for you.
I may have some time to trade about 8 hours from now.  If you're not available then, we can try another time during the weekend.
That time it will be like 4 am here, I think weekend might work better.
Sure, no problem.  I'll check throughout the weekend.
I'll be around to trade for a bit if you're available.
Sorry I wasn't available before, let me know if you're still around.
No worries. :)

I'm still available.  Adding you now.
This is what I'm trading from my side, I will pm proofs after we're done with the trade since I need to search for them.
