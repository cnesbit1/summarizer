I have Aspergers and have never been medicated for it, the only one's who are, are those who need it to function properly. Think twice before you spread crap on the internet.
I do too. I self diagnosed a couple years ago. Make no mistake, the vast majority are absolutely drugged as children.
I'm medically diagnosed by a doctor who knows what's best for his patients. I'm from the UK where we have free medical care so they don't force you onto drugs unless it's absolutely vital that you are.
&gt; a doctor who knows what's best for his patients

Doctors treat symptoms. **A doctors job is to sell medicine**. You may not like this but it's the truth.
In the UK, medicine is free, it costs the government money, they don't prescribe medicine unless they have to because it costs the patient ¬£0 but costs the government the inflated prices charged because of the backwards American system. Only American doctors sell medicine, most other countries don't charge for medicine the patient needs. Are you so absorbed by your little bubble that you have no idea how the rest of the world works? I don't think you're autistic or aspergers, I think you have the age old problem of thinking you're intelligent because you're not smart enough to understand how little you actually know.
Stop saying you have 'free' medical care. You pay higher taxes to pay for it.

There's no such thing as free. You still pay for it one way or another.

&gt;it costs the government money, they don't prescribe medicine unless they have to because it costs the patient ¬£0 but costs the government the inflated prices charged

Why would a doctor trying pay off med school debt give two shits about what the government pays? Think about it. Do your doctors work for the government?

&gt;insults

Shocker
You know student debt in the UK isn't actually a shackling chain right? You pay 9% of what you earn over 25k, also, it wasn't until the turn of the millennium that there were even tuition fees in place, so any doctors over the age of 45 won't have any debt at all to pay off.
Doctors aren't treating you out of the goodness of their heart. It's naive to think this, or even consider it. Being a doctor is a career. Just like any other profession, it's their job to make money. It's not complicated.
ok, it is not free, *it is just that his government will make something to avoid his lost of life.* **Your government** *will not and will require that you to spent alll your money before you die*.
They get paid the same wether or not they prescribe medicine, you know that right? In fact as medical negligence is a major concern for a lot of doctor's, they take great care in making sure they treat people the way they need to be because otherwise they'll lose thousands from being sued but gain nothing for prescribing medication. Take the tinfoil hat off and give it a rest.
It's a matter of opinion. You enjoy your government stealing your money and buying healthcare for you. I enjoy spending my own money and buying it myself.
Lol you can't sue a doctor in the US. YOu *can*, but good luck with that one.

&gt; They get paid the same wether or not they prescribe medicine

This is so far from the truth it's ridiculous. They get kickbacks, bonus', all sorts of payoffs from pharma companies. Lol Honestly, I don't think you actually believe this

&gt;Take the tinfoil hat off and give it a rest.

Why are you on this sub?
what part? the one that i said that your government will let you die untreated and try to put your money into circulation by forcing you to spent in medication, or that his (not mine) country offers better medical assistance than US?
If you go back to my previous reply you'll notice that I said you're stuck in a bubble, I'm not talking about the US, I'm talking about the rest of the world. They don't get the kickbacks or bonus' elsewhere. But again you're not even smart enough to realise you're stupid.
The tax brackets are similar and in the UK we aren't taxed on the first 10k like in the US, but sure pretend that's why and not because the US wastes money on an overinflated military.

Your government is using your tax money on a military that is bigger than the next ten combined anyway.

It is you that needs to take off your rose colored glasses.  There is always good and bad in medical care, the UK is no different.  Your doctors do get paid for prescribing drugs, so with regards to that, you either lie or you are ignorant.
Better medical assistance? Get real. People travel all over the globe to get treated in the US. We have the best doctors best facilities in the world. It‚Äôs not even close. 

Is it free no. Does our gov steal our money to overpay health insurance no. Is it expensive yes. 

It‚Äôs law that if you go to the emergency room, they have to treat you. Whether it‚Äôs the flu or a gunshot wound. Where are you getting this from
Insults.   üëç always a solid argument
Stop saying you have free sidewalks, free parks, free clean air, free roads to drive on, free anything. You pay taxes on it all.
Replying to only the part of the argument you want instead of all that was said, just as solid. üëè

Come again?
US isn't taxed for the first 26k under our new tax plan. I think it's 26k.

Perhaps is we wasn't policing the entire world, we wouldn't need a huge military. Perhaps if yalls was a bit larger, our could be a bit smaller. Don't ya think
&gt; People travel all over the globe to get treated in the US

and your people die because they can't afford for it. 

&gt;It‚Äôs law that if you go to the emergency room, they have to treat you. Whether it‚Äôs the flu or a gunshot wound.  
       
https://health.costhelper.com/emergency-room.html

&gt;For patients covered by health insurance, out-of-pocket cost for an emergency room visit typically consists of a copay, usually $50-$150 or more, which often is waived if the patient is admitted to the hospital. Depending on the plan, costs might include coinsurance of 10% to 50%. (**for people who have their money *steeled* by healt insurance**) 

&gt;For patients without health insurance, an emergency room visit typically costs from $150-$3,000 or more, depending on the severity of the condition and what diagnostic tests and treatment are performed.

&gt;Services, diagnostic tests and laboratory fees add to the final bill. For example, Wooster Community Hospital, in Ohio, charges about $170 for a simple suture, $200 for a complex suture, about $170 for a minor procedure and about $400 for a major procedure, not including doctor fees, medicine or supplies.

&gt;An ambulance ride typically costs $400-$1,200 or more, depending on the location and services performed.           

they did not charge you in UK for this, actually, here in Brasil any person in a emergency situation that do not have a healthy insurance is treated for free (any foreign too) in this situations too. i believe that this is the same in most countries in europe.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism#Employer-sponsored_health_care_in_the_US         
&gt;A report of McKinsey and Co. from 2008 found that between 60,000 and 85,000 medical tourists were traveling to the United States for the purpose of receiving in-patient medical care. The same McKinsey study estimated that 750,000 American medical tourists traveled from the United States to other countries in 2007 (up from 500,000 in 2006).The availability of advanced medical technology and sophisticated training of physicians are cited as driving motivators for growth in foreigners traveling to the U.S. for medical care, whereas the low costs for hospital stays and major/complex procedures at Western-accredited medical facilities abroad are cited as major motivators for American travelers.
"They don't get the kickbacks or bonus' elsewhere"

You mean like the UK?  [Lies](https://www-telegraph-co-uk.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/30/individual-nhs-doctors-receiving-100000-per-year-from-drugs-firm/amp/?amp_js_v=a2&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;usqp=mq331AQECAFYAQ%3D%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s). If people like you continue to sleep on this, it will get worse.  What in the hell makes you think big pharma does not see the the rest of the world as a commodity that they can exploit?  It already is happening.  Downvote me again you fool.
Emergency rooms bill you. It's against the law to not treat you. They don't demand payment or else they send you away lol. Cmon dude, very fake news.
The US collects 26% of GDP in taxes, the U.K. is 34%. That means the U.K. collects 46% more in taxes than the US.

Lol. Your arrogance and ignorance is why the world hates us. You think the Middle East asked us to police them?  Or do you think we got involved because of our dependence on oil. Interesting how we only become interested in areas with wealth and or resources.  How well do we police Africa?
i do never said that they will present you with a bill when you are bleeding, they will after, for sure.  
so die after, to pay for it, what a relief for those who need...
What? It may hurt your credit but **by law they have to treat you**. You seem to not understand this part.
I never said I agree'd with it so why be a dick? I'm just stating the facts of the situation. The middle east situation is extremely complicated to be pinned on oil dep. Ironic you called me arrogant and ignorant tho lol.

We do police Africa. China in knees deep in Africa working against us. Dude, you sound like you don't have a clue. Why even comment
Free clean air 

Wut?
Good day sir ‚úåÔ∏è
Corporations would pollute the fuck out of your environment without the controls put in place by the government. None of the people, systems, or processes that manage this are free. They all happen because you pay taxes.
and no medical insurance premiums

Summary:
You pay taxes on it all.
It's against the law to not treat you.
People travel all over the globe to get treated in the US.
"They don't get the kickbacks or bonus' elsewhere"

Lol you can't sue a doctor in the US.

Do your doctors work for the government?
