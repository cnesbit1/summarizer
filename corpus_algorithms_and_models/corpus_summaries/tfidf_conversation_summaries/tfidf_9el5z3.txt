Hey all! 

Looking for any and all HA Love and Moon Ball pokemon since I have none of those! 

Here is what I have on hands, all 4 egg moves and in Heavy Balls with HA.

* Slakoth
* Larvitar 
* Froakie
* Chikorita
* Totodile
* Zorua
* Pancham
* Chimchar
* Grubbin

Also looking for HA Heavy Ball pokemon too, if you'd like one of the above listed pokemon but don't have anything to trade let me know! and I'll send them your way - I have a bunch left over from breeding.
Got a few I'm looking to off load brother

[](/moonball) **Mooners**

* Riolu
* Cubone
* Rockruff
* Murkrow
* Honedge

Any of them take your fancy?
Awesome those would be epic, what would you like in return?
A Slakoth would be sick.  Other than him,  you pick. Junk stuff is probs best if you need a clear out. 

Got Love Ball Miltank too if you're keen?
That's great man! I'll send you a perfect lazy sloth then xD and the Miltank will be cool too, thanks a lot! 

Is that Rockruff Own Tempo? Just so I don't try and trade in Moon
Nah these ones are steadfast ones from a while back
That's perfect! OT Rockies are over rated haha
I'm in plaza now if you're able to trade.

You'd be the one to ask this too! What's the most dastardly stall team you can play? I've got a battle against a friend coming up and I want to go full wall/stall haha
I am indeed the one to ask.  Let me swapto my craptop and I'll devise a team :D
Thanks for the Pokemon and looking forward to the team you come up with!
Excuse you. OT rockruff has the prettiest of the 3 evos, mister!
We all know how bad your taste in pokemon, shinies and other things is ;)
My taste is impeccable, thank you very much. Oh. I also have a heavy HA Golett on hand, if you need?
I just realised it auto-corrected to unlikable when I meant unkillable.  Depends who is on the receiving end, I suppose :P
Can't argue with that,  but it's just a bit over done,  y'know?

Midnight is the real killer if you ask me!
*sigh* I **guess** I can see that. But it’s still sooooo pretty!!!! \^_\^

He’s so....creepy looking o_O although all their colors are pretty (I might like blue)
Blue = Best ;)
Hahaha that’s exactly how I read it! Definitely unlikable
Oh and thanks for the Sloth et al of course!

Summary:
I am indeed the one to ask.
You'd be the one to ask this too!
