Original Response:
English Heritage cares for over 400 historic buildings, monuments and sites which bring the story of England to life.

One of the sites we look after is Stonehenge, perhaps the world's most famous prehistoric monument. It was built in several stages, with the Stone Circle erected in about 2500 BC.

2018 is a special year for Stonehenge, marking 100 years since the site was gifted to the nation. This marked a turning point in its history, beginning a centenary of care and conservation which continues to this day.

EDIT: We're signing off now, Reddit. Thank you so much for all your fantastic questions today and we're sorry we couldn't answer them all. We've really enjoyed doing this AMA and we'd love to do another one soon. Tweet @EnglishHeritage with your ideas for the next topic and we'll see what we can do!
Hi, and thanks for the AMA! I would love to visit Stonehenge, but I fear that tourists and noise would spoil the experience. I'd like to have a peaceful moment there where I could appreciate the history and meaning behind the circle. Is there a time of day/year where that would be possible?

E: thank you Reddit!
I’ve been twice, first thing in the morning when they open. It was very peaceful and lovely. There were still people around, but most are listening to the audio guide so it is pretty quiet.
We went in April, and used a tour guide that allows inside access (you get to go into the ring and be up close to the stones, as compared to seeing it from the outside about 20 yards away - you have to make sure you book a tour that allows inside access). There were about 20 of us in the group, and they split us into two groups, allowing each of us about 15-20 minutes of relatively quiet and private access inside the ring. 

Gave me goosebumps, was one of my bucket list items since I was a small child.
That sounds incredible! I didn't think you were allowed to get that close...and to do it in a small group as well. Thank you, this has just risen about 30 places on my to see list.
Good tip, thanks!
Do you mind sharing/PM the tour you used?
Same experience here, go first thing in the morning! If you're a tourist, spend the night in Bath and take a morning Stonehenge tour leaving from there. It's much closer to the stones than London, so you beat most other large groups there.
Sure, happy to - wife has the details, will ask her to dig them up.

My sister and I did it 2 years ago today. 1000000% worth getting up at 5am.
You can also visit [Avebury Stone Circle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury) which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and location of another regional Neolithic stone circle and henge monument, situated about 20 miles North of Stonehenge. At Avebury there are no restrictions around access, meaning you can touch, climb and explore the site up close. It is also far less traffic'd and best of all it is free! There is tourist information also available at the site, and you can (should you so desire) walk from Stonehenge to Avebury and recreate some kind of Ancient prehistoric pilgrimage.
Butting in, you don't need to join a tour. I mean, you can, but you don't have to.

It's an amazing experience and completely worth every cent.
Nice! It may have been just easier for us since we were in the US to arrange the tour for inside access, I don't know. I know there were people not allowed inside at the same time that we were. 

Our trip was in 2014, (May, not April), so I don't know if the rules have changed.

I was just at Stonehenge in July and it was actually one of my favorite spots I visited because it was relatively quiet and I felt at peace even tough there were people around.
Also it has the world's only pub within a stone circle!
100x this. Avebury is way better than Stonehenge. Now don't all go there and ruin it please.
Avebury is great. If you don’t mind travelling a bit there’s also the Ring of Brodgar, which is an actual stone circle (at Avebury the stones are scattered so it doesn’t look as neat as Stonehenge). The Ring Of Brodgar is in Orkney, an island north of the mainland of Scotland. It’s free and you can totally go there early and be completely on your own with the stones. It’s magical.
Or stay in Salisbury and enjoy the Skripal Experience
We did the early morning inner circle tour this year. It was amazing! Small group, really quiet, the staff were chatty and helpful. You go right in and walk inside the stones. Book directly through the English Heritage site (not a big tour company). Totally worth it!
It's a very good pub, great food.
And unlike Stonehenge, you can actually touch the stones, please don't yell at me if touching the stones is bad.
We did Goldentours, but we think PremiumTours also makes private arrangements. 

With you being able to make your own arrangements (thanks watterpotson!), the other benefit of a tour that I can think of is that while we had the tour time slot reserved, no one else was allowed into the stones.
I'm Australian and it probably would have been easier to join a tour, but my sister and I had hired a car (spent a week driving between Edinburgh and London), and we were staying nearby, so it made more sense for us NOT to join a tour.

It's actually our two year anniversary since going to Stonehenge. I miss the UK.

Depending on how one is travelling (especially if they've based themselves in London), it would be easier to join a tour, but I thought it would be useful to know there are other options.
There's a half-assed Stonehenge outside of San Antonio that is usually empty if you want a similar, cheaper knockoff effect.
When I went it was super meh. But it does have a cool well inside the pub!
I was there in 1978. No crowds, no fences. You could walk right up to the stones. It was prettt cool.
The Ring of Brodgar is my favourite ancient monument.  There's a lot of powerful magic there, definitely.  Orkney is full of amazing sites.
AVEBURY IS TERRIBLE! DON'T GO THERE. 

The fewer people who go there, the better for those of us who do!
Mate... Nice!
I've been to that pub! I dragged several friends to Avebury in August of 2016. We'd been sailing for a week and were on our way back to London to fly home. I'd wanted to see Avebury since I visited Stonehenge in the 1990s and the tour guide asked everyone on the bus why we didn't go to Avebury instead, it's better. And that was back when you could walk among the stones at Stonehenge. 

My friens and I had lunch at the pub before walking part way around the stone circle and visiting the museum. Definitely worth the visit.
Go during a soccer game.  You'll have the place to yourself.
**DON’T TOUCH THE STONES!**
&gt;  the tour guide asked everyone on the bus why we didn't go to Avebury instead, it's better. 

Ha! My friend from Croatia visited Stonehenge and was very disappointed by the distance and fence, and referred to it as 'Shithenge'. 

My recommendation was to visit Avebury and do the Ridgeway walk instead!
“Magic”
You’re a wizard, ‘arry!
There are dozens of stone circles throughout Britain.  Most of them are much more "authentic" than Stonehenge.  You can be alone (maybe some sheep about) for as long as you like.
The ridgeways 80 miles you maniac ;D
We went to the stones in the morning and Salisbury Cathedral after, it was a lovely!
I mean they are places of druidic worship as far as I understand it.
Hi! It looks like you've had some great advice already but we'd definitely recommend the Stone Circle access tours, which give you a unique opportunity to see the monument up close. The tours take place outside usual opening hours, so you'll be at Stonehenge with almost nobody else - a pretty special experience! There's more information about these tours on our website: [https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/plan-your-visit/stone-circle-access-visits/](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/plan-your-visit/stone-circle-access-visits/)
I did a bus tour (that took us to a few other places as well) that got us in after they closed and allowed us around the stones, not just the walking path around it like you get with standard admission. Totally worth it.
Aha I know! I did about 15 miles of it last month with my friend and my drone! Swindon to Uffington.
Actually the Stone Circles were built thousands of years before the Celtic druids arrived in the UK
Err yeah I didn't say the druids built them. It's still a point of contention who did. But they did use them as places of worship.
You can also pay extra to go before it opens or after it closes, and in those small private groups you get to go past the ropes and into the circle.
This is great news for me. Thanks, and thanks to all the knowledgeable redditors as well!
There is a [very nice one in Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryhill_Stonehenge).  I have not been the the real to compare the feeling, but it's quite impressive
Local here, don't go to Avebury - its terrible. Horrible. Go to stonehenge instead.
Avebury is by far the better experience.  I saw Stonehenge.  Looks just like the pictures.
I did the same tour and had a similar experience this past July. Also on my bucket list. It was awesome and the highlight of a month in the UK. I also brought a travel guitar and played a little Spinal Tap tribute.
Was just talking about walking it over a long weekend with my son. Carrying all camping gear etc. Long time dream of mine.  Camped out at Waylands Smithy a few times, very odd dreams
That's awesome! I haven't had a chance to download and edit my footage, but here's one I put together on the train home. It's an amazing route - I think you'll spot all the key locations!

HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN
Yes 3pm on a Saturday is a famously quiet time across the nation
Really nice video! Wheres that at 45 secs, barbury Castle maybe
Probably the first and last time I’ll ever see a reference to Walyand’s Smithy on Reddit.
[car henge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carhenge) is quite nice and quiet
All over the world, the newcomers convert the old places of worship to their new religion. This is very evident in the number of Christian churches built on the sites of (and often from the materials of) pagan shrines. It helps convert people to your new religion by both eliminating their place of worship and providing continuity with their old gods.
There is a late evening tour you can sign up for in advance. Very small group, and you get to walk up amongst the stones. Quite intimate.
Man I don't remember there being a fence and I visited around 2002-2004. Maybe I have a shit memory?
Hmm good question, that was flying north from Uffington Castle... so I will look at a map!
I went on a bus tour, and our tour was the only one there at night when the sun was setting.  My mom organized it, so I'm not sure which company it was, but we left London, and also went to Bath and had supper at a tavern with a dirt floor, thatched roof, and a 700 year old liquor license, if that helps.  I went in around May in like.... 2006 I think.
Really?  Where?  What is it called?
It's not really that much of a point of contention, we know when they were built and the people inhabiting the Isles at the time.

You are correct that some were used by the later Celtic tribes as places of worship, but I was just pointing out the Druids never created them
Or is it Brogar? This debate is a good way to while away many hours with the locals.

Also, don't miss the Standing Stones of Stenness!

Seriously though there is some good stuff up there, a lot of ancient and creepy tombs...
Is there magic there
pretty sure it'll make little difference here. there's no major pro team nearby and it being one of the UKs major sites on the tourism trail is immune to that sort of stuff.

Best bet is winter when it's cold or early am before the coaches show up.
Brutal
meh.
now this is why I come to this fucking site. To hear this guy add a great story...to a great story.
The whole of Orkney is a treasure trove of Neolithic remains. From Viking graffiti in Maeshowe to a whole settlement preserved in Skara Brae. It’s a wonderful place.
I was just there last night. It was a private sunset tour with Golden Tours. There were 50 of us on the bus and when we arrived the site was closed to the public. We were allowed inside the circle 25 at a time for twenty minutes. It was amazing.
I went to both in the same day, Avebury was much better.
I shit you not: ***Stonehenge II***

In Ingram, TX
Wow, I had no idea this was a thing. I was there in 2004, and, while it was great, I'd love to be able to get closer to the stones.
Who built them?
Well the last time the fey only got out for a century, no need to get persnickety about it.

Summary:
I mean, you can, but you don't have to.
I know there were people not allowed inside at the same time that we were.
Avebury is way better than Stonehenge.
You go right in and walk inside the stones.
I went to both in the same day, Avebury was much better.
I was just there last night.
Avebury is by far the better experience.
It was very peaceful and lovely.

I was there in 1978.
We did the early morning inner circle tour this year.
The fewer people who go there, the better for those of us who do!
