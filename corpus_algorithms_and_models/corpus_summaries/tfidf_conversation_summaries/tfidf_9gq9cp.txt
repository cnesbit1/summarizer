Original Response:
I am physically sick from this and keep switching between vomiting and crying. I have more evidence than anyone should ever have proving the sexual harassment I have been dealing with for the past 3 weeks. 

Yes. I said 3 weeks. Not 3 months. Not 3 years. 

I have 42 pages of printed messages. Much of it me repeatedly telling him to stop, that I want to maintain a professional relationship, that I find this inappropriate. 

The final straw was me responding to his sexual questions with "I would prefer to maintain a strictly professional relationship." and him replying with "I don't mind if you don't mind." 

In the three weeks since class started my fucking professor has asked me out 3 times, sent me numerous inappropriate texts, and refused to listen as I repeated told him I wanting nothing more than a student teacher relationship. 

I had to go to the department head. 

I know this isn't my fault. But it still makes me sick. I'm destroying a man's career. 

But I have to. Because the next girl might not have my metal. 

Ugh. I just needed to vent.

Very good point. The department head most likely already knows about the issue and will handle it the way it was handled last time, which was most likely to not handle it at all.
Yes, absolutely. We got a Title IX presentation a few weeks ago at the school I work for.  Technically the dept. head is required to go to the Title IX officer, but it doesn’t hurt for the student to do it as well, just in case. 

Edit: I can’t Roman Numeral.
Title IX works for, and in the best interests of, the university.
Title IX?
Yes, thanks. It’s been a long day.
Absolutely!  The department chair may be helpful, but the procedure would be to go to the Title IX officer who is trained to handle cases.   

Also, as people have said, things do get swept under the rug at some universities, but with this clear proof and the threat of a lawsuit, I don't think this will if OP is willing to fight.
Nope, title IV, when presented with a sexual harassment allegations the department head must immediately go to the financial aid office and make sure the students loans are being properly paid out.
I have been trying to get him (the title 9 officer is a man. ugh) to call me back.
