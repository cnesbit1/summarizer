Original Response:
Title says it all mostly. He and I have known each other since sophomore year of college when I transferred to my school from another school (we are both seniors now). We became close friends pretty quickly and over the past year or so have gotten to a point where we are basically each other's best friend.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer and into the start of this school year he has become increasingly touchy with me, and he seems to initiate one-on-one plans more often. Last week we were hanging out with a group of our friends in his dorm room watching a movie. Later in the night some people got tired and went home and it was just me, him, and his roommate watching the movie. I decided to go home too because I had class early in the morning. I live in the same dorm as he does so I just had to go downstairs to get to my room. I got there and realized I had left my key in his room, so I went back upstairs to grab it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I was about to knock on his door I realized that he and his roommate were talking about me. Being the little snoop I am I stood outside and listened a little bit (I know, I know). I basically overheard him telling his roommate that one of our other friends had mentioned that she thought we should date, and he had been thinking about it and would "really like to date me". He also said something about how his feelings for me had been getting stronger over the summer. His roommate responded that he thought we would make a good couple and then they started talking about video games or something. I waited a little while longer before I knocked to make sure the conversation was over.

I really don't think my friend has any idea that I overheard their conversation. I'm kind of freaking out because I definitely have feelings too and I would totally love to date him, but I'm scared of losing the friendship if it doesn't work out. Is it a bad idea to date a close friend? I'm also super awkward and don't know how to react if/when he tells me about his feelings for me. Should I act like I had no idea? Should I bring it up first? help! 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: was hanging out with my friends and after I left I overheard my best guy friend telling his roommate that he wants to date me. I'm into him and would date him but I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Yup, start off with honesty!

Yeah if there’s one thing that everyone loves it’s pointless games with their emotions!  Op should also probably play hard to get, wait 3 days to call, and neg the guy a little bit, right? /s

Do not do this.
Could be a pretty fun opportunity for a surprise date kind of thing, op should plan something and be like "Hey I overheard you the other day, really want to date because I do? Great! We start right now! Get in the car!!"
