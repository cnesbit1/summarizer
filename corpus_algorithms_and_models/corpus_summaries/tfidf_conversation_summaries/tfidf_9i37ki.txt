Original Response:
I got the ranker about 2 weeks ago and it worked great until yesterday morning when the up button started to register as always being pressed so the mod can't even fire.
Contact whoever you bought it from.
I contacted Smoant customer service yesterday and have heard nothing back
Generally the best thing is to deal with the vendor, not the manufacturer.
Try them on here. Theyâ€™re real good.

Thanks for the tag!
&lt;3 no problem!
It's possible since it's the weekend they didn't get back to you. Please be patient and if they don't contact you by Monday let me know so I can escalate it
Thank you very much for responding, and i had figured that was why i hadn't heard back.  I will definitely let you know should the vendor (whom i've contacted now) or your customer support not reach me by monday afternoon.
I'd honestly forgotten that was an option, I used to work in a shop so the manufacturer is my instinctual point  of contact.

I contacted Smoant customer service yesterday and have heard nothing back.
