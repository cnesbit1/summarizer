Original Response:
I believe I am correct in saying that the majority of Christians believe the Bible is a mix of literal truth and allegory. Those who do not believe in a literal covenant with Abraham or a literal Jesus, son of God have nothing to worship, and those who believe every word inevitably fail to explain the contradictions present from Genesis 1.

However, when determining which sections are true and which are false, the most common reason to declare something allegorical is its physical impossibility. For example, we now know that Moses' 40 years in the desert almost assuredly did not happen, based on a complete absence of physical evidence from studies that would have been impossible to complete 50 years ago. 

So, I have two questions relating these premises:

1) Does the bible give us any *internal* clues as to which of its sections are literal and which are metaphorical? Can we distinguish history from fable based solely on the contents of the Good Book?

2) If not--if science can upend millennia of religious consensus and establish that text previously assumed to be factual was really allegorical--then what use is the Bible? How can the Bible be said to help us understand the world, when in fact our understanding of the world can *override* our understanding of the Bible? And how could the Bible have been useful for Jews and Christians of ancient times, if its meaning could not be deciphered until new sciences were developed centuries later?
