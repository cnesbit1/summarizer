Just stumbled upon this bike. 

A dual front, regular bike with the famous inline 3 Yamaha engine (850 cc, 115 hp), even experienced riders think is extraordinary.

I am pumped to ride that one, since I recently took the new FZ 09 for a spin.

How do you feel about it?
A lot of people on here shit on it.  It's funny how anal people get about OEM's trying out new ideas.  I think that anything that creates more or unusual interest in powersports is a net win for the industry. 
  
I  think it's a very cool bike.  It's got its pros and cons, of course, but at the end of the day it's a step in the evolution of motorcycles.  Time will tell if it's a misstep or if it's a new direction.  There are other takes on this style, like the [MP3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaggio_MP3).  The good thing about these designs is the greatly reduced risk of head shake and better contact patch in the front, improving front-wheel(s) grip on the road (reducing the chance of the front end washing out from under you, which is hugely difficult to recover from on the street)
MP3 is a scooter though, the niken is the first venture ive seen into motorcycle territory with the leaning thing from a major manufacturer. 

I'm just curious if you can slam on the brakes on a curve like you can with the can am spyders without issue.
The MP3 is a scooter and that's not my cup of tea. The german version of the testing videos in the alps, had some semi-pro Yamaha Cup riders have ago and they were quite happy with the bike, especially considering the usability for normal people.

Like I said, I recently took the FZ-09 out for a spin on my home turf and it was like riding a mountainbike with 115 hp. 
I have a Honda Firehawk 996 with some upgrades and it was faster just off the lot with a much more modest seating position and all the electronic gismos.

Well, I'm really looking forward to ride this klingon wheelchair ;)

A scooter is well below any motorcycle performance when it comes to dynamics. 

The NIKEN is fun and can be considerd a mature bike, while the MP3 is a safer city-surfer option. 

With two wheels in the front the bike can slide a bit, where a regular bike would just produce a low sider. Lose grip in the front and you're down. 
Here you can feel the loss of grip and still be safe.
Yeah, ignorance!

I know people who were bitching about ABS, then cornering ABS, then traction control and wheely control and blippers and now they have a 2018 Fireblade and it is just so good to have these MOTO GPâ„¢ electronics to really USE the power of the bike.

And before that they were bitching about fuel injection, drive by wire, compound tires...

I'm more on the side of sporty bikes and I find 100hp+ to be a nice place to be on a bike.
I like the thing myself, but then again I'm kind of attracted to oddballs so whatever.
