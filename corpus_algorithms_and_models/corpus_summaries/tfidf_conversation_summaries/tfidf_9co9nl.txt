Original Response:
Trying to prove the Trinity is like trying to prove a flat earth..  we already know that the earth is round.

Of course, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit work in unity, but this doesn't mean that they are the same God. 

The Trinity is a man-made belief and it shouldn't be worshipped as if the book guides us to do so. You have no proof of this claim.

- I'm debating that belief in a Trinity is no different than the belief of a flat earth joined at it's four corners.

We are told to follow Jesus Christ.. not the beliefs of some strange old men that claim to know more about Jesus Christ than he knows himself.
