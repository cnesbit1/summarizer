I am in the same boat as you my friend!

Be sure to talk with as many priests as you can!

Have you had a chance to visit a seminary yet? Have one youd ideally like to go to?
I haven't yet. That's all a few years out for me. My brother in law just started at St. Vlad's and we have a seminarian from St. Tikons assigned to our parish. They are both good resources.

Right now my focus is on improving my spiritual life and taking on more ministries in our parish (under the guidence of my priest, of course).

Said a prayer for you, too. Praying for divine guidance for your path.

I’m aware and I don’t need an evangelical to lecture me on how to become a Catholic priest there are plenty of people in the Church who can do that for me. 

Which Billy Graham and Joel Olsteen books should I get?
Coming from a future Catholic, that attitude is not appropriate for someone who wants to be a priest. One of your goals should be to bring people of differing faiths into the fold, not to mock them. "Judge not, lest ye be judged."

Good thinking. I'm in the same boat, I recently visited Saint Tikhon's with my fiancee and absolutely fell in love with it. My priest went there, and it just feels like where I want to be. So until then, I'm doing as you said keeping life in order and working at ministries,but we're a few years away from attending.
I am not defending American evangelicalism. I agree with you: it has a lot of problems and is certainly overly political. I am saying that if you want to be a priest, you should not respond to differing opinions with scorn and animosity.

&gt; “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.  For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.

Matthew 5:43-48
I didn’t I asked for book recommendations.
