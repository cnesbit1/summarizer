Things which I do not understand;

* The action of many have a biased element to it, for one to know what sin is and has a craving for it, is something that has boggled my mind, why would a "loving father" plant the seed of sin in us, expose us to it and made us with a sinful nature, you might say " but we had a good place, free of sin and its effects" I don't understand how though? you say it as if I or you ate the forbidden truth and caused this place to be damned, the actions of two should not determine the consequences for the generation to follow. for those who think it is a metaphor that's a whole new set of problems.

* why is hell eternal? I mean how does someone justify that? what good is it to punish some repeatedly for ever? that is the worst thing imaginable and not fair, the judicial system seem more reasonable to me. (even if they are in prison for life they are not punished, before anyone says anything).

&amp;#x200B;

* what did Jesus actually save us from? It seems that he saved us from himself...what? why would he go through all of that, create us, create this place, know what was going to happen and then tries to save us? why even create humans if you know that most of them are going to be punished for ever?

&amp;#x200B;

* why would he give us the power to destroy ourselves? if your kid was holding a loaded gun wouldn't you take it away from him? or let him make his choice to do what he wants with it?

&amp;#x200B;

* if he is *omniscient*, this would have to be all orchestrated, couldn't have been by accident, no chance.

Hell has to be eternal because the Bible is true and it's so, but it also has to be because if it isn't than heaven wouldn't be either. 

The rest of these questions I answer by this : I know God is righteous , merciful, loving, and true. I know he is way smarter than I will ever be and I would have to be prideful to judge why he made it this way. He is literally in control of everything happening in the universe and sometimes we might think we can comprehend that but the truth is we can not. We can ask him these questions when we get into heaven, as for now just follow the his word and obey him, and wait till you can ask him yourself.

So if one part of the bible isn't true, none of it is?
Yes. It is all true.

 John 1 

**1** In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God**.
Hmmmmmm, I'd have to settle with it's true enough.  Some of the bible seems far more cultural than the word of God.
John 1 King James Version (KJV)

1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God.**
That doesn't actually answer the question.  It's just a single verse from John.  If I just quote “If a man meets a virgin who is not betrothed, and seizes her and lies with her, and they are found, then the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the young woman fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, because he has violated her. He may not divorce her all his days." does it actually further the conversation or do you and I both agree that our daughter's will marry their rapists provided they pony up a little money?

If this is too confusing for you, please just quote John 1:1 again.
This is the truth and now after Jesus died for our sins to be forgiven we are under the age of grace. Funny enough I will quote **1** John 1 this time. He has a way of making things funny like this.

1 John 1:5-10  King James Version (KJV)

**5** This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.

**6** If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

**7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.**

**8** If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

**9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.**

**10** If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if you can't handle that verse I think it would be best to take Paul's advice and not marry or have children at all if it will affect your faith so much.

1 Corinthians 7:7-9  King James Version (KJV)

**7** For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.

**8** I say therefore **to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I.**

**9** But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.

 Matthew 10:37 King James Version (KJV)

**37** He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
My friend, What is the point? Why do I have to die to find out the answers to my questions? And there is no guarantee that my questions will be answered. 
If these questions are left with no answer, I'll always be doubting and can't give it 100 percent. So maybe in hell ?
You don't have to die to find them out. It might takes years upon years of prayer before they are revealed to you. If you want your questions answered more than to worship God, I do not know what else to say to you.

Hebrews 11 King James Version (KJV)

**11** Now **faith** is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.

**2** For by it the elders obtained a good report.

**3** Through **faith** we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.
&gt;  Funny enough I will quote 1 John 1 this time.

Not actually funny.  Expected. And still no answer.  I'd say this was fun but it was mostly a waste of time.
Sorry I couldn't help you out! Have a great day and God bless you! \^.\^
How can I worship God if he does not answer me?

I cant worship God if I'm doubting and it is a matter of principles I believe, I have asked for a resolution and he turned his back. What is a person in my position meant to do?

I have faith and I'm waiting patiently, I'm still holding onto some of his principles (I've stopped prayer though), however, I might get to a point where ill just let go.

many people in position would've let go, I'm still waiting.
He will answer you,sometime it takes years though so you might want to be more patient and move on and worship him with the time you have. Also for all you know we could be raptured 10 minutes from now and it will all be answered then. This life is not about getting answers to questions, it's about obeying and worshiping God.
In years time I'll probably have let go. oh wells, that is his will for me I guess. And I cant worship, I can't do it in this state.
Do not be dismayed my friend, you will get your answers soon enough. I'll pray for you also and we can do it together!

Joshua 1:9 King James Version (KJV)
9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
I had the verse up on my wall once.
thank you for trying to help.
No problem here is another one I like.

Romans 8:18 King James Version (KJV)
18 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.

Summary:
How can I worship God if he does not answer me?
If you want your questions answered more than to worship God, I do not know what else to say to you.
