We're at a ~35.000% price increase compared to Monday. Any argument that contains some degree of "protecting the sigil economy" is now absolutely worthless.
Someone bought around 15k Sigils for 2 silver and 55 copper on patchday. He will be really rich now.
In fact, he will be halfway to the goldcap. If only I knew to invest in those sigils early.
Bear in mind you restrict a lot of your potential buyers if you are only willing to sell at the current prices. I estimate this person will make around 35-40k liquid gold
Why did they go up so much?
You need like 20 or 30 for the new armor, so yeah same as intact mosaics just more bonkers.
Oh lmao time to collect some level up rewards in that case
I wonder if it's one of the dataminers who knew the sigil will be needed right after the patch was uploaded and before anyone actually got to do the quest and find out
Based on BLT 's chart, the price hiked several hours after the patch was live.

So it's likely they burned through content and saw the opportunity or insider information but they decided to delay their purchase to make it look inconspicuous.
If that's so I'm not mad (burned through content part) :)
He probably was already rich. it's always the same few people who do this.
Why do you assume it was one person?

It's more likely that several people got to the crafting part and bought up sigils.
So you're saying I should've used my powers for evil and could have been rich instead? ಥ_ಥ

Meh, can't be bothered to be honest, there's no fun in abusing the system at the cost of other players.

Dulfy intentionally didn't release the sigil update information in their original guide to the patch to keep it under wraps long enough for the speculators to make their purchases. When you combine that with datamining and likely Anet connections (wouldn't be the first time...) it's way more than "luck". It's a setup. The best speculators aren't the best because "they get lucky". They are the best because they use outside-the-game resources to shift things in their favor. 

Sure Joe Warrior can see sigils at 1g and decide to buy 30 and celebrate his small victory when they go up to 10g, but he's a drop in the puddle of speculation and not really worth mentioning.

Dont turn to the dark side of the market
&gt;Dulfy intentionally didn't release the sigil update information in their original guide to the patch to keep it under wraps long enough for the speculators to make their purchases.

That is unbelievably untrue.
I am sorry but where are you getting the fact that I unintentionally withheld information? I published the requirements for items for each piece as soon as it was known. There was no withholding of any kind. Since you like to post false information without any supporting evidence, let me post some of mine own.

On Sept 18, right before daily reset, I joined a squad of 50 players working on the Requiem collection. We had no idea what to do and as a squad figure out we had something to do with the ancestor grove. This took a bit of time to figure out each piece by piece since people had to farm Mistonium to acquire each additional piece. As soon as I know the requirement for gloves, I posted it. Look at the time stamp for my edit 02:08 to 02:31 (timezone is in UTC), is where I input the info: https://i.gyazo.com/102e3e3a2f52fd8ddbbae6558b671b9a.png

Also look here at this screenshot, this is exactly when I got the information for the sigil of nullification - at exactly 10:19 pm my time (02:19 UTC). There is exactly a delay of 11 minutes from when I heard the information to when I post it. Is this called withholding information? I mean it takes me a couple minutes to just type it out and format it: https://i.gyazo.com/4551cdf29cd5d3a378d9c45e1c39be65.png

In fact, I only purchased 20 Sigil of Nullification myself, predicting based on the pattern that I probably need 10+5 +5 for the next couple steps. No extras for investing were purchased. You think that if I was withholding info I would have purchased a few hundred for myself and tell all my friends so that we can become rich together no?  https://i.gyazo.com/542698bd20649eed34a04292aeab5762.png

As for Anet connections, please. What connections? I am not in the early access program and I don't go out of my way asking anet devs. Besides which anet dev would out info like that and risk losing their job over it?
I'm glad you posted this, because fuck that guy making baseless accusations for the sake of stirring up drama.  Just a small note in your first sentence I think you meant to use intentionally instead of unintentionally.
Everybody is obviously going to take Dulfy's word here because it's just he said she said and I'm a nobody redditor. What happened, happened.

Edit: Dulfy is using the yoast plugin which is not secure and tracks lots of data about how you update your page, it's not hard to use the meta yoast tags and some monitoring script to track when this information was changed. Whether or not you think it was done fast enough is up to you.
Truth is the free-market can not regulate itself well. This price increase is insane for something that barely actually has worth.
If you are going to make a defamatory claim against someone you better back it up with some evidence if you want people to believe you.
What if I don't care whether people believe me? People can do their own research and judge for themselves. Dulfy has a reputation to protect. I don't. I could care less about who would profit from something like this.
Or able. Some people have work or other life, and can't be sitting at the marketplace waiting for patch notes to tell them which item to buy out.
If you don't care whether people believe you, why would you say it? What research did you do that led to this conclusion? 
I am extremely naive when it comes to the economy in this game, but if you can point me in the right direction I would look this up myself.
I compared the dates/times the page was updated with the sigil information and it was too slow for my liking. I work in SEO so I have a ton of tools readily available to track this stuff when I am curious about anything. Dulfy is running a run-of-the-mill wordpress website with a Yoast plugin so it's pretty out-of-the-box to check this stuff. 

Dulfy says she updated it "as fast as she could" which I don't believe, but that's up to the individual user. I said it because the OP in the comment chain suggested the people profiting were doing so simply by being attentive and doing the content faster than others, which is a load of horseshit. You think the best speculators in the game who control hundreds of thousands of gold in wealth are playing fair? lol.
I don't think you had to post anything proving him wrong. Your name and reputation in this and other communities speak for themselves.
If Dulfy were going to secretly tell people insider information about these sigils, I would be one of those people and would now be tens of thousands of gold richer. I'm not. Shut the fuck up you ignoramus.
You are the one besmirching a well respected community member with zero proof and zero evidence. You don't get to say "prove it yourself" because you, through your actions, places the burden of proof 100% on your shoulders. If you can't follow through you should have just shut up and moved on.
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/%22Finish_Him!%22
Dulfy was like, 10% of my original point. Not even the focus. It's you guys who zero'd in on that part of the comment since she chose to respond. The GW2 community is hella interesting, lol.
When did I say Dulfy was intentionally leaking info? I said the site wasn't updated. Would be pretty dumb for her to do that, since one person ratting her would likely be the end of her site (and thus a dumb move).
Dulfy was the focal point of your argument, that she "deliberately withheld information for speculators to take advantage of the market". You zeroed in on that.
[deleted]
Or some people dont like fucking other players, i saw the sigil would skyrocket a few hours after patch, have thousands of gold but only bought 50 for me (wasnt sure how many you would need) and thats it.

Is not about skill or be willing to do it well, you have to have a special kind of personality to be fine with fucking other players too
[deleted]
&gt;Everyone has the ability to, they're just not willing/skilled enough to do it well. 

Yeah, I'm going to call utter bs on that sentiment. By time some of us are able to get onto the game this kind of thing has already swept through and made progress inaccessible.
[deleted]
You really are this stupid. Yikes. Glad I linked her your comment so I could watch you go from +7 to now -23 when she proved you wrong.
[deleted]
&gt;This price increase is insane for something that barely actually has worth.

/0 logic. It has worth now. People are buying. You seem to think that there is  some kind of greater justice that defines this item's "inherent value". There is none.

And gw2 is so, so far away from the real scary free market with all it's implications, that I cannot stop laughing at this sandpit tragedy we  have here.
Yeah i dont blame them , or have any hard feeling about the people that do make a profit out of it 

Is not about if i dont do it someone else would, i just dont feel good with  myself doing it , i cant do much about other people doing it but i can do something about what i do and feel with my actions 

And indeed is anet fault, but it is what it is
Except its simply bad game design. Patches that screw over 99% of the playerbase will kill any videogame. Letting a bunch of rich players exploit a bad collection to leech money from real players just makes the game objectively worse.  Arenanet needs to either change the armor requirements or add a recipe for the sigil.  Arenanet should also hand out temp bans, at the least, to the people that bought up thousands of sigils when the patch came out. Those people knew what they were doing and knew what how it would effect other players. Toxic player behavior should not be tolerated in any form.
It sucks, but it wont kill the game, otherwise it would have died years ago. This has been happening forever, and it will never stop.
You completely miss the point, this shouldn't even be a worm....
Not possible for them to burn thru the content in such short amount of time. Some of the collection items has to be done in sequential order; if u miss a step, u have to wait for the next cycle. Moreover, Mistonium is hard to come by. Insider trading is the more likely culprit.
For patches to not have early mover advantages due to poor design?
The question is: how did this TP baron obtain the info so soon?

U need to advance far enough into the story to unlock sun refuge and complete the 1st part of the collection. And then kick-start the 2nd collection by defeating a dps-check bossfight, followed by completing the ancestor tree's events in sequential order, before learning the requiem armor recipe.  

It took the community a day or 2 to put a guide together but it only took a TP baron hours to figure out the recipe? It makes sense not.
This is the same excuse every scumbag convicted of felony fraud, robbery, carjacking, etc. uses too. "He just left his keys in his car. I wasn't the only one tryna steal it, just the first to get there."

Or not make a item that is crucial to a widely advertised new component for all players be something that is wholly gated by the economy and can be hoarded and scalped by a select few.
People are buying it because ANet put it in the collection. Not because it has actually worth outside of the collection. They could have choose anything that had no worth and the results would be the same.

Like another comment said, using the dungeon specific sigils would've been better than some random uncraftable hard to obtain worthless sigil.
Data mining? Idk. Definitely not insider info bc it would have been found sooner.
Gross
Datamining probably
That's not speculation, just using your funds to remove the bulk of supply from the marked so you can dictate the prices.
&gt;Not because it has actually worth 

This is just pure insanity. Didn't you read my post? Apparently you simply cannot compherend how market and demand work in their simplest forms and just need someone to blame.
Very rich people do the same thing with low market cap stocks all the time, they're purposely manipulating the economy. This isn't high risk/reward for them. 

But I've done similar stuff in this game so I'm not an angel. I do believe it's wrong though.
Zero **net** economic impact is the key idea (some exceptions apply). Adding a crafting recipe for the sigil is good design, period, as people should be able to use either markets or crafting to get what they need, but it would also make the market saner.

 

And as flaagan noted, making the star feature of the patch require weird crafting components is obviously bad design from an economic POV. "Know this thing you have zero of and cannot craft or farm? Guess what? You need 25!"
So you are saying it has no worth accept that it has worth.
Items do not have to have multiple reasons for being worth.
Its plain simple. Does a buyer want to pay for what a seller is offering?
Its that simple.
Catography...  just add a pirate's favorite letter to get cartography.
Bingo, this is the reason I never go much over 10k gold. I flip what I need to maintain 5 figures and stop after that.
Economy-wise i dont see much wrong with using this sigil for this purpose.

There are some pros and cons:

Getting a lucky drop form the forge or an exotic weapon drop that has this sigil slotted now nets you significantly more gold than before patch. So you could also see this as a first attempt of correcting rare sigil prices away from vendor value, something many players have been complaining for a long time about.

If thats the case and they are actually looking at ways to improve the value of minor and major runes and sigils, they usually test those changes in small scale scenarios like this before implementing the whole system. So it would make sense to use only one sigil for now instead of implementing new sinks for useless runes/sigils for a wide range all at once.

It also works quite fine as a conduit for wealth transfer from wealthy, impatient players (veterans) to poorer, patient players (casuals and new players), who dont need to unlock everything within the first days. Someone who only plays for a couple of hours will be more timegated by the amount of map currency they need before they even need the sigils or they are still working on the prerequisite collections.

However, unless this is really a field test for new sigil sinks, I could think of plenty other items that would have been more suited for this.

The biggest problem here is the unelastic supply because these sigils are hardly farmable. I havent mass-forged runes or sigils in a while, so i am not even sure if it still turns a profit (or at least lets you break even) but due to the slow forging process and rng involved, I assume that you need at least a couple of hours of straight forging rare sigils to get the 25 you need for the collection, not something many players are willing to do, when there is a new episode to explore. 

The exotic weapons are mostly RNG drops from mobs and event chests, so not really farmable. 

[Arc](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arc) is the exception because it also drops from a couple of common champ bags that players may be hoarding in their banks, so right now would be a good time to open them, especially since common material prices are high atm as well.

My guess is that the choice of this sigil was more inspired by lore (its needed for a containment field to nullify stuff), rather than economic reasons.

The biggest gripe with this choice of item I have is that it isnt really farmable on the new map, so something like pulsing brandsparks would have been a better fit, plenty of branded on the new map that drop crystal lodestones, nevermind eyes of kormir, ley line sand and concealed putrescences.

So it would make sense to use only one sigil for now instead of implementing new sinks for useless runes/sigils for a wide range all at once.

Since you're more experienced with TP stuff, is this actually a valid approach? Personally I'd expect a minor broad-reaching sink as a test as this sigil has few reserves and very limited faucets leaving it wide open to panic buying, flipping and other manipulation.

You've got the labels wrong here. The main profit will go to flippers and hoarders, and many new/casual players will need to pay through their nose as well because the time gates have reliable solo progress while the sigil doesn't. Only those who don't care about the skin *at all* will truly benefit from the increased sell prices.
&gt; Since you're more experienced with TP stuff, is this actually a valid approach? Personally I'd expect a minor broad-reaching sink as a test as this sigil has few reserves and very limited faucets leaving it wide open to panic buying, flipping and other manipulation.

Of course its a valid approach especially since this would be an attempt to gather data mostly:

* what gold price are players willing to pay for a new armor set

* what consequences has it for its faucets (price of exotic weapons to salvage/supply of rare sigils to forge them via rng)

* are Anet partners, who get to play the content before the patch honoring their NDA

* what is the community reaction

* how fast does supply re-enter the market and prices decline

Despite the obvious unelasticity in supply that many people here seem to bemoan, there is one big faucet that many dont consider:

The amount of nullification sigils that got sold directly to the vendor, destroying it before it even enters the market, which is probably a good chunk compared to the ones that got listed at vendor value or sold to the highest bid, if there was one.

So its a viable approach to collect some data and community feedback but i doubt that this method will be implemented on a bigger scale in the "big fix" without any iterations.

You make a fair point, the guy buying out the 16k sigils at the start is probably the biggest benefactor (he actually contacted me to get some advice on how to sell them). Next in line will be hoarders and speculators.

The problem is that we cant have change without getting change.

If we want economy related stuff fixed, we cant complain afterwards that they changed it too much, overbalanced or broke something else.

Fixing the upgrade component market has basically been a demand since shortly after launch because since then it has been broken. Anet acknowledged that years ago but also said that fixing it is very complicated because it touches so many major markets (rng loot, crafting, forging, salvaging, base mats, gold faucets). There has been so much oversupply that everybody in their dog bought at least 1 stack of runes or sigils at some point in their playtime with the thought to make a nice profit, once Anet fixes the market.

Some players have tens of thousands useless runes and sigils hoarded away that there is no chance that Anet will find a way to get them off vendor value without someone reeling in big profits.

And here I just see alot of salty comments about the guy who bought out the sigils because its some market manipulation in their eyes.  If you cant stand a fellow player profiting off market changes, you simply cant have change.

The othr issue here is that its too expensive to finish this collection and that is quite debatable.

I didnt finish the collections myself yet or calculated their total costs based on current market value but taking a glance at dulfys guide i highly doubt that it will cost you much more than the ~200g you need to currently cough up to craft the 3 lunatic sets from halloween.

So even at 5-6g, i wouldnt say that the armor sets (which got good feedback for the looks) are currently overpriced.
&gt; The amount of nullification sigils that got sold directly to the vendor, destroying it before it even enters the market, which is probably a good chunk compared to the ones that got listed at vendor value or sold to the highest bid, if there was one.

That's more of a sink than a faucet, all of those would have been acquired elsewhere which Anet should be able to track anyway.

&gt; If we want economy related stuff fixed, we cant complain afterwards that they changed it too much, overbalanced or broke something else.

Of course we can fault them for overdoing it like they always do. Faster, more conservative iteration can reach desirable values with little to no overswinging.

&gt; And here I just see alot of salty comments about the guy who bought out the sigils because its some market manipulation in their eyes. If you cant stand a fellow player profiting off market changes, you simply cant have change.

The main difference here is that the nameless "someone else" would have made the investment in advance, incurring costs for long-term storage and the risk of never seeing anything pay off. Those who were lucky to reach the collection early were essentially guaranteed the payoff while still paying the same pittance of an initial investment.

These massive swinging changes allow a few players to *deliberately* corner the market and make massive profits without even necessarily playing the content. If they e.g. added an equivalent to Amalgamated Gemstones even buying out all trash runes/sigils would not have worked because of dungeon vendors and other sources.
&gt;It also works quite fine as a conduit for wealth transfer from wealthy, impatient players (veterans) to poorer, patient players (casuals and new players), who dont need to unlock everything within the first days. Someone who only plays for a couple of hours will be more timegated by the amount of map currency they need before they even need the sigils or they are still working on the prerequisite collections.

This doesn't work in practice. The rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of the economy in general IRL, and signs point to that being the case in MMOs. The rich get richer and everyone else gets fucked.
&gt;And here I just see alot of salty comments about the guy who bought out the sigils because its some market manipulation in their eyes.  If you cant stand a fellow player profiting off market changes, you simply cant have change.

I'd contend it is reasonable to call any economic change which allows one or a small handful of fast movers to reap vast profits at the incredible expense of everyone else bad. All else aside, it simply isn't necessary. Adding a new, not especially cheap crafting recipe in this same patch would put a price ceiling on the sigils, as one example of an obviously superior solution to the status quo.

&amp;#x200B;

The economy should work for the vast majority of players, not a minuscule handful of greedy, scheming TP manipulators.
You sound like the vast majority of players was never given a choice to either buy these sigils at 1c copper over vendor price as the hoarders did, buy them out before this guy did or not sell their dropped sigils to the vendor/list it at a higher gold value.

They all made a conscious choice.

If hoarders and speculators wouldnt have put in low buy orders for these sigils for years, stopping other players from destroying them by selling them to a vendor, we would have ended up now with alot less sigils in the economy and would have seen an even harder spike and slower rebound.

Its the vast majority of the players dictating the market, that was the case before and after the patch. First they tanked the price to vendor value by constantly undercutting each other out of greed to sell their sigil before all other players, then they simply moved on to destroying them for 2.5s from vendor.

Now they are responsible for the price spike because they keep destroying sigils to advance this collection.
&gt; That's more of a sink than a faucet, all of those would have been acquired elsewhere which Anet should be able to track anyway.

Its a sink that they basically removed, or moved. First you got 63s for destroying 25 sigils, now you get to advance the collection for destroying 25 sigils.

&gt; Of course we can fault them for overdoing it like they always do. Faster, more conservative iteration can reach desirable values with little to no overswinging.

No, fault the player base. Check out sliver of twitching forgemetal. They were available for 40c last weekend and right before patch, they were sold out and going for over 16s without Anet doing any iteration at all.

How does a fast and conservative iteration look like in your opinon?

Its either fast or conservative.

Amalgamated gemstones also went up from 50s to over 3g after HoT got released, even though you could forge them out of any of the t6 universal upgrade components, which went from 3-30s.
&gt; How does a fast and conservative iteration look like in your opinon?

"Fast" as in "frequent". For example adjusting the leather or ecto drop rate every month or so but only by ~10% at a time. Doesn't work in every case of course but they have a history of making *several* broad-sweeping changes which all act in the same direction. Sending all of those live simultaneously as opposed to staggering and adjusting seems monumentally stupid to me.

&gt; Amalgamated gemstones also went up from 50s to over 3g after HoT got released, even though you could forge them out of any of the t6 universal upgrade components, which went from 3-30s.

Well I don't recall other sinks but many people were **very** hyped for the gen2 leggies and just like the sigil t6 gemstones can't be farmed reliably.
They didn't make an **informed** choice. The theoretical framework that makes the free market work well assumes perfect information for all participants, as well as a lack of monopoly power (e.g. the actions of any individual person have little to no effect on market price).

 

Saying the free market works without those preconditions is like saying radiation therapy is the correct treatment for all human illness, rather than just cancer. Free markets will consistently produce degenerate results when the assumptions are violated, as we can see here, or in the worldwide 2008 recession, among other instances.

&amp;#x200B;

This is mostly ANet's fault, because they designed all aspects of this market, but it is also the people involved, because "just following orders (market incentives)" is not a legitimate excuse.
&gt; They didn't make an informed choice. The theoretical framework that makes the free market work well assumes perfect information for all participants, as well as a lack of monopoly power (e.g. the actions of any individual person have little to no effect on market price).

I dont disagree that the free market needs perfect information for all participants in order to work well but i dont see any violation of information distribution in this case because there is no sign of insider trading.

I also think that those theoretical frameworks you are talking about, were established decades ago during a time when information flow was far below what we have now where we have broadband internet, livestreams etc. 

These days the challenge isnt anymore to find information but to find the right/reliable information.

And there it comes down to personal ability and skill in gathering information, be it in game or online.
Happy cake day

It doesn't need to be outright conspiratorial insider trading, merely different people getting the same information at different times to cause a market failure, as seen in this case.

&gt; These days the challenge isnt anymore to find information but to find the right/reliable information.

Poor information is actually worse than no information, because it still leads to incorrect decisions, but causes rational agents to underestimate the risk involved.

&gt; And there it comes down to personal ability and skill in gathering information, be it in game or online.

a. Personal skill barely matters. This is a right time / right place issue. To use an illustrative example, I could have trivially foreseen this, and bought enough for myself (or more, but I don't speculate on markets because I'm not a dirtbag), but I was busy with work and WOW. But overall, the evidence consistently suggests that very few winners actually win because of brilliant insight, rather than lucky timing, unfair advantage, or dirty tricks. The myth that people make money, either in MMOs or IRL due to ability alone is less true than ones about leprechauns or unicorns.
 
b. Something that doesn't work for different ability levels is still ineffective. We don't build fire escapes that require someone leap from one ledge to another and pull their body weight up because personal ability levels differ. Is this less important than fire escapes? Of course. But if the system doesn't work for the bottom 99% of ability levels, it doesn't work.
 
I have little personal investment in the issue, but bad design is bad design.
&gt; It doesn't need to be outright conspiratorial insider trading, merely different people getting the same information at different times to cause a market failure, as seen in this case.

But information was provided for everybody through the same channels, only some people acted on it and some didnt. Thats not the faiure of the market, thats the failure of the participant.

Even if Anet would have put a banner right across the screen when you log in after the patch that you will need 25 sigils to complete the armor collection, it wouldnt have made a difference to the prices they currently have.

&gt; Poor information is actually worse than no information, because it still leads to incorrect decisions, but causes rational agents to underestimate the risk involved.

I agree but again, this isnt the fault of the market but the participant, who failed to find the right information before other participants who already acted on it.

Anyways, I would be interested in your opinion, what you think would have been the right and the wrong decision for a market participant in this scenario.

&gt; a. Personal skill barely matters. This is a right time / right place issue. To use an illustrative example, I could have trivially foreseen this, and bought enough for myself (or more, but I don't speculate on markets because I'm not a dirtbag)

I think we can agree that after the guy who bought out the 16k sigils after patch, speculators, who put in bulk buy orders at 1c over vendor value at some point before the patch, made the most profit from this market change.

From your comments i gather that you think that those speculators are bad for the free market and their actions are morally questionable. I cant deny that many other users may agree with you but i dont.

Those speculators were willing to pay more than the vendor, when the majority of the player base would just sell these items to the vendor and destroy it.

So those speculators effectively managed to stop thousands, if not tens of thousands of those sigils to be destroyed. And now, they are able to put these sigils back into the market and without that extra supply, even less players could have completed that collection by now and prices would have been even higher, yet they get flak for being greedy bastards. I got news for you, its not them that are greedy, its the majority of the player base that is greedy and would rather have 2.5s at the time the sigil dropped for them instead of keeping them (like the speculator did) and wait for a better use for these sigils.

&gt; But overall, the evidence consistently suggests that very few winners actually win because of brilliant insight, rather than lucky timing, unfair advantage, or dirty tricks. The myth that people make money, either in MMOs or IRL due to ability alone is less true than ones about leprechauns or unicorns.

If that is your believe, I wonder why you are expecting a free market that is fair to all and only has winners and blame Anet for it when it doesnt happen. 

&gt; Something that doesn't work for different ability levels is still ineffective. We don't build fire escapes that require someone leap from one ledge to another and pull their body weight up because personal ability levels differ. Is this less important than fire escapes? Of course. But if the system doesn't work for the bottom 99% of ability levels, it doesn't work.

If something doesnt work for your ability level, it can act as incentive to raise your ability level. If all participants, regardless of their abilities get the same return, why would anybody bother to raise it?

If you cant lift your own weight, in many dire situations you will die. You can either work on your own ability to pull yourself out of that situation or expect others to install a safety line to pull yourself out or install that safety line yourself.

If you cant be bothered to work on your own ability to pull yourself out or put in the work to install a safety line, why do you expect others to do it without compensating them for it?

Is that how a free market is supposed to work in your opinion?

Here is a fact:

Absolutely nothing has changed in regards to obtaining this sigil, it still takes the same effort and ability to get them as before the patch as their faucets havent been altered.
&gt;But information was provided for everybody through the same channels, only some people acted on it and some didnt. Thats &gt;not the faiure of the market, thats the failure of the participant.

It doesn't work like that. Either everyone has the same information at the **same time** or they don't. The sum of participant behavior is the market, so a market has failed if the participants make bad decisions. That's literally the definition of market failure.

&gt;Even if Anet would have put a banner right across the screen when you log in after the patch that you will need 25 sigils to &gt;complete the armor collection, it wouldnt have made a difference to the prices they currently have.

It would have with sufficient notice and supply. The other part of the problem is that the GW2 market violates the principle that no one person should be able to personally shift the market price.

&gt;Anyways, I would be interested in your opinion, what you think would have been the right and the wrong decision for a &gt;market participant in this scenario.

Correct ethical decision: Buy 25 sigils immediately.
Correct amoral decision: Buy as many sigils as possible, immediately.

&gt;From your comments i gather that you think that those speculators are bad for the free market and their actions are morally &gt;questionable. I cant deny that many other users may agree with you but i dont.
&gt;Those speculators were willing to pay more than the vendor, when the majority of the player base would just sell these items &gt;to the vendor and destroy it.

This actually has a great analogy to people who charge $10 for batteries in a hurricane, which is illegal in some places as price gouging, and some economists cheer for. Evaluating it takes a bit of nuance. Anyone who has kept a bank full of these sigils waiting for their time to shine has actually helped everyone, and should be rewarded for their contribution to the community with piles of gold. But there are also plenty of people who saw the requirements, thought, "Well, no one should be allowed to have fun without paying me first," and bought existing sell orders to relist them. They contributed zero additional sigils to the market, they simply used liquid capital to step in and parasitically drain money from others.

&gt;If something doesnt work for your ability level, it can act as incentive to raise your ability level. If all participants, regardless of their abilities get the same return, why would anybody bother to raise it?

It's a game. It is supposed to be fun, not an Ayn Rand dystopia where a handful of elitists sit on golden thrones and laugh at the peasants below. Moreover, the game is saving Tyria from the dragons, not trading materials futures. ANet should not put their next set of armor behind people proving they can run a 8 minute mile IRL either, because while every person without a diagnosed medical condition should be able to run that fast, it's a stupid distraction from having fun engaging with the game's main mechanics.

Besides, if we define something as 'good' regardless of consequences, the term means nothing. "Well, sure, this medical treatment fails 99.9999% of the time, but that's just because most people don't have enough grit!" is a self-evidently wrong thing to say. This is the same thing.

Summary:
It doesn't work like that.
People are buying it because ANet put it in the collection.
I could care less about who would profit from something like this.
Either everyone has the same information at the **same time** or they don't.
&gt; Something that doesn't work for different ability levels is still ineffective.
&gt; They didn't make an informed choice.
It's more likely that several people got to the crafting part and bought up sigils.

If you don't care whether people believe you, why would you say it?
They didn't make an **informed** choice.
If only I knew to invest in those sigils early.
Its the vast majority of the players dictating the market, that was the case before and after the patch.
&gt; And here I just see alot of salty comments about the guy who bought out the sigils because its some market manipulation in their eyes.
I don't think you had to post anything proving him wrong.

What if I don't care whether people believe me?
First you got 63s for destroying 25 sigils, now you get to advance the collection for destroying 25 sigils.
If you cant stand a fellow player profiting off market changes, you simply cant have change.
Dulfy says she updated it "as fast as she could" which I don't believe, but that's up to the individual user.
Its either fast or conservative.
&gt; And there it comes down to personal ability and skill in gathering information, be it in game or online.
I do believe it's wrong though.
This is the same thing.

the actions of any individual person have little to no effect on market price).
it's always the same few people who do this.
Is that how a free market is supposed to work in your opinion?
I have little personal investment in the issue, but bad design is bad design.
This price increase is insane for something that barely actually has worth.
&gt;And here I just see alot of salty comments about the guy who bought out the sigils because its some market manipulation in their eyes.
The problem is that we cant have change without getting change.
Arenanet needs to either change the armor requirements or add a recipe for the sigil.
And there it comes down to personal ability and skill in gathering information, be it in game or online.
Economy-wise i dont see much wrong with using this sigil for this purpose.
So it would make sense to use only one sigil for now instead of implementing new sinks for useless runes/sigils for a wide range all at once.
This doesn't work in practice.
I compared the dates/times the page was updated with the sigil information and it was too slow for my liking.
