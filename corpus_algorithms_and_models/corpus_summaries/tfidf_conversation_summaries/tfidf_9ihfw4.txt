What the fuck does:

Gotcha.

What's the full context of that quote?
&gt; Geesink and Meijer have developed a generalized music (GM) model to explain the harmonic structure of the living universe. Using an adapted Pythagorean musical scale, the same semi-harmonic 12-note pattern can predict: 1) which electromagnetic frequencies are life-sustaining or life-damaging (2018a)

Let me preface this by saying that I haven't read the full text yet, but given that context I believe that makes perfect sense.  
Given that energy is vibration within the various universal fields, and that matter is an interference pattern of these wave functions, it would seem to make sense that some frequencies are beneficial to the formation/continuity of life whereas others are detrimental through the process of harmony, be it resonance or dissonance. Everything is waves. Matter is waves, albeit orders of magnitude more complex than simple monotone frequencies, but given that it is comprised of waves then it makes sense that it would have resonant and dissonant frequencies.  

By themselves those words don't make sense. But when you look at them in full context and read the sentence before it makes sense.
