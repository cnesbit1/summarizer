Original Response:
Christians of Reddit I am a skeptic and open to hearing your ideas. May I ask how you came to Christ and how you knew He was the right one? Also please send Bible verses to support claims and just good ones to read.
I witnessed the change in my dad when he started believing.  I figured if Christ could change a guy like my dad....
So through experiences you came to faith. Do I just have to wait for mine?

If God wants you in the faith you will get your cue somehow.  

As Paul says, "If today you hear God's voice, harden not your heart."
What if he doesn't want me? This is a real question not just playing the devils advocate.
Then enjoy life while you have it.
Does He want everyone or just a select few?
Just a few.  

"The gate is narrow that leads to eternal life, and few find it."
God wants EVERYONE. Even if you don’t want him he will always be wanting you. 
God desires intimacy with all his children. And anyone can be his child. 
Psalm 27
"What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?”

God seeks those who are lost.
Yes, he does.  Yet also, "No one can come to me unless the Father first draws him."  We cannot will our own salvation, God must will it first.
I don't think that's a possibility. 

1 Peter 2:8  8Beloved, do not let this one thing escape your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 9The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

Summary:
What if he doesn't want me?
If God wants you in the faith you will get your cue somehow.
