I hope he scores a hat trick. Would be hilarious.
If Ward is in net it will only take three shots
If Forsberg is in net it will only take three shots.
I hope he just sits on the bench and says "fuck you, you cheap prick"
If no one is in net it will only take three shots.

Leafs should have at least one of Sparks, McElhinny or Pickard hitting waivers, might be something to consider
If Scott Foster is in net, it won't happen
3 goals only ever takes 3 shots.
At this point... fuck it, give it a shot lmao!
Bring daddy Sparks back to his home state!
--William Karlsson, probably
Cam Ward?
Yeah he was our capstone free agent signing this summer...

I assure you the hawks sub is. The front office however may not be depending on what they know about Crawford that we don't
Everytime the Leafs have been in a situation lately where they "have to make a decision" they've found a way to steer clear somehow.

This one really gets me interested if they do it again somehow.
Unless you have Patrik Stefan shootin your pucks.
No, Joel Ward decided to change positions
Ok
I doubt it'd be Sparks, dude had an incredible year in the AHL last year, no?
Yeah tru.. Having said that though, he's not been so great this preseason, plus he has the least amount of NHL experience. Big Mac had awful numbers before becoming Leafs back up but has shined in the role since, despite not playing a lot. So.. Who knows? Could happen.

Summary:
If Ward is in net it will only take three shots.
If no one is in net it will only take three shots.
