I can do NA redeems on managed saves.  The rate is 2:1 for single natures or 1:1 for 3 natures
I'm interested in single nature(timid) redeems for both pokemon. Let me know when you see this so I can send you the codes :D
hello! for some reason the reddit is fun app didnt send me a notification.  go ahead and send those codes and ill have them ready for you ASAP!
codes sent, no rush you can take your time (:
Codes received.  

I know I did some redeems for you before but can you remind me of your time zone? Do you have any specific requests like date or proof?
EST. As for proof just a picture when the code is 'searching for gifts', an 'A button proof' pic and a third one where you can see the nature of the mon. I don't know how dates add any value to these redeems so I don't care about that :D
They absolutely dont add value imo.  Haha
Your Pokemon will be ready for pickup tomorrow evening.  :)
I'll be available tomorrow if you are.  I didn't catch you the other day
Yeah I'll keep an eye on my notifications
You around?
Here if you are let me know
Still there? I'm coming online
Yeah still here
I'm finishing uploading your proofs now
I'll check tomorrow since it's getting late here but thanks for the redeems! Glad we could finally trade so there's that haha
The proofs are sent (they're in the same folder as your previous proofs).  I apologize for the delay.  I would have had them quicker but grandma had emergency surgery this weekend (she is okay now, quad bypass and valve replacement!) and it threw my schedule off a little xD  

Proofs sent, codes received, pokemon sent! thanks again /u/ntproto
Good to hear she's better man, I'm sure she enjoys your company. Take care man and thank you for the trade!
