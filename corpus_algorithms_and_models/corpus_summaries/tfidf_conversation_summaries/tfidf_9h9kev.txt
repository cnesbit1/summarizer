I missed TCSS threads and the cosplayer drama ;A;
&gt;  the cosplayer drama 

haha i didn't pay attention to the cosplay sub-forum so don't know any drama
Oh! I thought Inktober is like, a drawing/doodle a day xD.
i thought so too, until i decide to actually go to the official homepage and read the rules.
I haven't drawn in like 5 years since I got burnt out on O level art and I've been wanting to get back into it. Any suggestions on how to do inktober?
&gt;1) Make a drawing in ink (you can do a pencil under-drawing if you want).

&gt;2) Post it*

&gt;3) Hashtag it with #inktober and #inktober2018

&gt;4) Repeat

&gt;Note: you can do it daily, or go the half-marathon route and post every other day, or just do the 5K and **post once a week**. What ever you decide, just be consistent with it. Inktober is about growing and improving and forming positive habits, so the more youâ€™re consistent the better.

&gt;*Post it on any social media account you want or just post it on your refrigerator. The point is to share your art with someone.

Thanks!!
TIL my ladyboss isn't really my ladyboss. She is the mistress of my boss, working in the same company. And my colleague is the ex-brother in law of my boss' ex-wife. 

Is this some taiwanese drama 

EDIT: forgot to add that... ex-brother in law has to work hand in hand in the same department with *ladyboss* :)
wow must be really awkward at work

wah so many twist.
Have you found out that you're actually the daughter of the boss so by right you should be the successor but you lost your memory and later realized that you are long married to your colleague?
is your ladyboss good looking?
*Ni hao, welcome to Beijing*
LOLOLOL please dont pull this on me okay. My colleagues are all @ my parents' age. ðŸ¤£ ......... except my *ladyboss*
can draw a chart? my brain cant comprehend xD
Wink if they're monitoring you behind your back :)
I confused leh. Brother in law means he's the boss's brother? Unless ex wife got other ex husband then is the brother of other ex husband.
Bro in law is his ex-wife's brother.
Honest serious question.. Is it still a mistress if the wife is now an ex-wife
