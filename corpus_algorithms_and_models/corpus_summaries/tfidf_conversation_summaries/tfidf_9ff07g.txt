Original Response:
*No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.* [John 1: 18] 

If they were a *three-in-one* God known as 'God' like the Trinity claims then the apostle John would have to be a liar because he said no-one has ever seen God. 

He makes a distinction between the Father being a God that nobody has ever seen and the Son being a God that has been seen.

Therefore, the correct answer would be..

- The Father = 1st God

- The Son = 2nd God

- The Holy Spirit is never called God a single time in the book.

Whereas the wrong answer is..

- The Father + The Son + The Holy Spirit = God

If God(Father) + God(Son) + God(Holy Spirit)= God (Trinity)

Then the Trinity, a man-made belief, would be your God above the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit separately.

God is Greater (GIG)

I dont know... its your interpretation vs ancient Christianity's one... i think ill stick with ancient Christianity
Ancient Christianity vs Ancient Judaism.. 

The Trinitarian belief didn't always exist..
What do you mean by that?

The Holy Trinity is three "unconfused" and distinct divine persons (*hypostases*), who share one divine essence (*ousia*); uncreated, immaterial and eternal. The Father is the eternal source of the Godhead, from whom the Son is begotten eternally and also from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally. The essence of God being that which is beyond human comprehension and cannot be defined or approached by human understanding.

To beget means to bring about... If God didn't create Jesus Christ then how did he 'bring him about'....?

&gt; The essence of God being that which is beyond human comprehension and cannot be defined or approached by human understanding. 

Then don't define it with the Trinity.
&gt; Then don't define it with the Trinity. 

Tell that to the bishops of the first few ecumenical councils... This debate has already happened and resolved about 1700 years ago. no need to start it again
Oh God resolved it.. did he? Ye are gods!
&gt;To beget means to bring about... If God didn't create Jesus Christ then how did he 'bring him about'....?

To beget is the fatherly equivalent of the motherly "to birth." The Son is *eternally* begotten of the Father. He is the eternal "publication" of the invisible God.
That's doesn't answer my question.
&gt;Oh God resolved it.. did he? Ye are gods!

What does "Ye are gods" have to do with this?
Either it does but you do not know it, or perhaps you are asking questions that are based on false assumptions?

Summary:
The Son is *eternally* begotten of the Father.
What does "Ye are gods" have to do with this?
Then don't define it with the Trinity.
