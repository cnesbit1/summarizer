Original Response:
Gus vs JJ 2 as main event at MSG would be awesome!
Can Joanna make the weight though?
Gus Davidson?
She'll have to get on that horse meat quick.
I dig it! USADA is what it is. I say... fuck it! we all want to see Jon Jones before he goes past his prime. Gus vs Jon is a real legit high level fight. One that Gus can win with the right game plan.

For the vacant belt?

You know that would sting for DC.
Get that square Paul Harris build.
It would be total bullshit. Guy KOs you and then pops for the second time. Then heâ€™s hardly punished and gets to come back and fight for the belt you just got back fair and square.
Or JJ vs Stipe
The problem with fuck it is that the ugly fighters like bigfoot or ones Dana doesnt care about like werdum get insane sentences.

Let's be rid of this fucking usada farce. I feel bad for those fighters

It's likely what DC would prefer.

DC thought he could retire before Jones came back, you know he wants nothing to do with that fight.  

He's gotten people to largely ignore those Jones fights and has started to try to cement his legacy with his HW belt win and he started in with the GOAT contention talks this year, the last thing he needs is yet another Jones loss, especially getting finished again, that'd shatter all the work he's put in.
You know DC doesn't want that fight either though, and he's can say he's focusing on HW, he's got the HW belt so he'd probably rather vacate LHW, defend the HW and retire in a few months as planned, than lose to Jones again.

Summary:
You know that would sting for DC.
It's likely what DC would prefer.
