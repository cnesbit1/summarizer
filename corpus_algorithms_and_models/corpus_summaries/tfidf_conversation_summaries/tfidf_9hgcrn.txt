That’s really sad. He was treated like dirt that season too - really turned me off from ATT’s coach. I thought he seemed like a nice dude
They were both assholes, that season was so douchey all around
We got see him grapple a one-armed Dan Lambert :(
only good fighters we got out of that season were Luque and Usman.
Yeah especially when they raced on the track. So try hard to create drama lol
Dan Lambert was an excellent heel manager during his stint in Pro Wrasslin last year.
And Usman clearly grabbed the cage multiple times
Kamaru "grabbed the cage" Usman
Only 30% of the time though.
I think he was a benefactor of editing.

Summary:
Kamaru "grabbed the cage" Usman.
