Awesome. Are you sure you wanna trade it?  And do you want this bunny to have the Hidden Ability?
I bred it just so i could make this trade. I didnt know what would be equal value for the buneary so I just went with a shiny. Yes, I would like Buneary to have its hidden ability, along with ice punch (if possible).
OK.  Can do on both fronts. Are you taking nickname requests for the lizard?
Do you mean you want me to change Charmander's name before I trade it?
If that's possible, yeah
Sure. Its the name rater guy in Heahea city right? What name do you want me to give it?
Yep and I'll go with 'Barry' methinks. Cheers
Ok, I named it Barry. Tell me when you are ready.
K.  Added you.  I'm ready
ok, im in poke plaza
you know your buneary was holding a gold bottle cap, right?
Yes indeed. Just for you :D Since that one only has 30 to Sp. Def.  Thought I'd throw it in since I felt the trade was a little in my favour there.

Thanks for the trade. Enjoy!
Thank you
