He looks amazing~ â™¥
I believe that is a female charr, judging by the face and head. Female heads go horn-ear-horn-ear from top down, and male heads go horn-horn-ear-ear. Even now that the horns are unisex, they purposely kept this horn-ear arrangement split between the sexes.
Well I cant argue with the gayest charr ever, you know your charr better than I do!
Naw its a he.
It's a male charr.
Ah! I wish we had a male face like that in game, it's really nice!
same, need more handsome bois
look at the side of the head facing us... it is horn-horn-ear-ear.
More handsome bois are always welcome~
