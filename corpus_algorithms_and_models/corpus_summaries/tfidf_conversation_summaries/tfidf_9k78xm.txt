**THIS IS SUPER CLUTTERED AND IT STRESSES ME OUT SO I MADE A NEW POST FOR THE UPDATE:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9kuza2/tifu_by_spending_300_on_laundry_update/?





For reference, I’m a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. I grew up middle class with a very simple family. Right now, I’m traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally I expected to do laundry at some point. I figured most Hilton’s have guest laundry so this shouldn’t be a problem. 

As I’m checking in I ask the front desk, “Do you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?” 

He goes on to tell me they don’t have quarter laundry but their Hilton does have guest laundry. I’d just leave my shit with him and they’d have it done by that evening. 

Me, being the simpleton I am, thinks it’s complimentary. To be fair, HE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT COST A LOT OF MONEY. I mean, based on my reaction alone, that should’ve been some indicator that I was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. Christ, I just asked where the local laundromat was. Of course I don’t have that sort of money. Plus, after he said that, I literally jerked my head back and was like, “Really? How does that work?” And proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how I never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. Not once did he mention cost. Even after I dropped off my huge bag of crumpled up laundry he didn’t say a word. Hindsight, of course it cost money. But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. I figured most people didn’t use the service since they typically just stayed at the hotel a night or two. It was probably used mostly by few people like me who traveled for work. Maybe I’m dumb, but still. He should have mentioned a cost. 

So I go about my day. Get back to the hotel. Get my laundry and thank the girl. The guy I had talked to before was gone now and it was a new person. As I’m leaving she says, “I’ll just add the cost to your room.” 

I’m taken aback but it happens so fast that I just smile and nod and go to my room. The entire walk up I’m replaying her words in my head. Cost? What cost? It wasn’t until I got to my room that I started to panic. I raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. They charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! The real fucking kicker is that they didn’t even wash nice clothes. Among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts, and my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. It was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. 

Now, I was raised to be polite, so I made sure to tell her I’m not at all mad at her since it’s not her fault, but WHAT THE FUCK???  I’m proud to say I kept my composure the entire time, but I felt like crying. I still sort of do. She gave me the number to her manager, and I sent him an email yesterday afternoon. He works on Monday, so I’m definitely going to stop in and see if there is ANYTHING they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. I travel a lot for work so I have a crap ton of Hilton honors points. Enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. I’m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.* My job definitely doesn’t cover that cost, and I most certainly don’t have that kind of dough. Not sure what I’m going to do. If anyone has any suggestions I’d be grateful for help. Unless I’m completely fucked.... 

Tl;dr - I thought guest laundry was complimentary. It is, in fact, not. Got a $300 bill when I could’ve just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry. 


**UPDATE**

This isn't a super exciting update, but I thought I'd keep you all in the loop. I received an e-mail early this morning from one of the managers at Hilton in reply to the frantic e-mail I sent after the "incident." She is "happy to work with me on the balance" but I don't quite know what this means yet as the e-mail was pretty vague. Could be anything from a full refund, to knocking ten dollars off, or a voucher, or something like that. She also asked me what amount I could pay towards the $300 bill. 

In my head, I was like *"uhhhh how bout free-fifty yo,"* but I realized that getting away with paying a reduced rate is more than fair and she was super generous to even offer that. Realistically, if I can get this down to $50, I'd be happy. I mean, I'd be happy with anything at all, but 50 bones would allow me to rest easy at night. 

So I decided to reply. 

I thought about it, and instead of listing a number I'd contribute toward the total, I chose to give her a more detailed account of what had happened. You see, email number one was written when I was tweaking out on adrenaline after this all originally transpired. I didn't do a good job of explaining how I was mislead, or how I didn't fill out any forms, and instead sounded like some frantic teenage girl who'd just gotten her first speeding ticket. So I pretty much shared the story that I did with you all, but spiffed it up with some grown-up words. At the end, I said something along the lines of, "In regards to how much I can pay toward the $300 bill--I was prepared to spend $5 in quarters for my laundry that afternoon (haha). I'm willing to work with you on the price, but I am unable to spend anywhere near $300 for laundry."

That's good right?! I have no idea as I'm horrible at this sort of thing. I'm so bad at balancing politeness with sternness; I always lean toward to nice, so when I try to be stern I either am not stern enough or am like Winston from New Girl and take it too far. I hate complaining and causing problems!! But I hate being out $300 dollars more, so I bit the bullet. Anyway, I sent that e-mail maybe five hours ago. My original plan was to go to the hotel this afternoon and sort this out, but since I'd received that e-mail, I thought I'd hold off to see if we could solve it that way. If I don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I will definitely go down there after work. I held off because I felt like marching down there hours after getting an e-mail was a bit aggressive. I'm in Houston for the week (staying at a different hotel) so it's no trouble for me to make the trip.

Anyway, that's what's up!! I'm hoping she just e-mails me this afternoon, and I can be done with all this drama. Shout out to all the Redditors who offered to help me pay the bill. That's insanely nice of you and it fills me with joy to know there are such kind strangers in this world. However, I could never accept payment from strangers for my own fuck up. 


Thanks for all the support and advice!! I really appreciate it.
Could u sell your Hotel points to someone for cash, or book a room for someone in exchange for cash?
At this point I would be willing to sell my soul for the money to cover this haha
No, this is terrible advice.
I know you're joking, but please do not do this.
It's not advice, it's offering a possibility for consideration, as a potential way to lessen the expense.
Except that selling hotel points is generally expressly forbidden by the program and can be traced back to you, causing you to lose all your points and your entire account. It might be a potential way, but not a very smart one.
Yeah, then she’d only have ten years left to live, and then the hell hounds would come for her.
Well done for helpfully pointing that out- if it is all the points she has then that's not such a deterrent, if the need is considered great enough.
And then the person you sold the hotel stays to finds their bookings are now cancelled since your account was shut down... and you have to deal with them as well. 

But if you're not convinced please try this with your own account and points instead of telling others to risk theirs.
[deleted]
I think she should.
I'm not *telling*, again I was suggesting a possibility for consideration. If it's too risky, then at least the possibility has been weighed up.
  Do you have any positive suggestions that might help ease the problem?
And I'm suggesting too all the downsides with this idea, of which there are many and would far outweigh any potential profit.
Based on...? And face consequences such as having her account shut down, having the points bookings cancelled and having to deal with an irate person who bought a hotel stay off her and has nothing to show for it?
So now we've mutually explained our positions, are we gonna stop squabbling?
It's £300 not £3000
I thought you were talking about her selling her soul loll
Apparently I’m on Tumblr now.
I can arrange that, where are you located?
At a Hilton that charges an arm and a leg for laundry..
Ask them to present the signed form for the laundry as you were told it was complimentary. When they cant present the form, ask them to remove the charge in full.
You think this would work?
Yes. Especially if they sent it out as you described. They have to have a charge sheet for it.
How else would they be able to prove their case if you decided to make a claim with your banking institution? If you argued the charge with them they have nothing not even a signed receipt backing it up. Paper trails are important.
Yes, something like this would require some kind of understanding of what the charges would be. The fact they charge by the clothing will help your case here.
Yeah, this is your best option. Don’t be nice, for once.
I’m the same way, I don’t want to get mad at minimum wage workers. But you gotta flop your proverbial dick at them. Say, “I’m not paying this, you didn’t tell me there was a cost.”
Don’t budge or let them just charge you half, or some bullshit.
Yeah, this is your best option. Don’t be nice, for once.

Maybe leave out the lie and just say you thought it was complimentary and you expect such standards from a Hilton hotel. They didn't tell you it was in fact not complimentary so in my eyes there's no ground for a contract between you and them.
Where is their evidence they even washed the items?
Absolutely. If there is no documentation, you are in a great position. If you don't want to get into a he said she said situation with the original employee that took your laundry, you could always say a random employee you saw in the lobby/hallway told you it was complementary when you asked, but of course you have no idea who it was. 

Or, as a previous poster mentioned, you could let them know it's a real bummer they lost that $300 dress you brought to wear to a formal dinner and you'd like reimbursement for the full cost of the dress.

Edit- you might consider posting to r/legaladvice
I worked at similar hotel chains in the past and can’t imagine the manager just not taking the charge off if you wrote to him explaining the situation, especially since no form was filled out and the front desk employee who assisted you neglected to mention any cost, despite the fact that you asked about quarter laundry ffs. And you're a loyal/frequent guest
I used to work in the hotel and hated how the guests could get away with almost anything. Free upgrades from cheap rooms to vips , free dinners etc. Being humble is good. But since hotels have different policies and complimentary complimentary services you can never be sure. Just hinting towards a bad tripadvisor review should be enough.
Yes. Explain that had you been presented with the costs prior to dropping your clothes off, you would have reevaluated the amount. Because you never signed off on them charging you, plus you ran back to another employee astonished by it not being complimentary means you have a good argument. Don't bring up your points. Make sure they know that while you should have asked first, it is their responsibility to inform you of the cost beforehand. Otherwise they are trapping you rather than allowing you to decide. For a Hilton, that is quite scummy behavior. 

Just make sure to be rational through the whole thing. I've found that when working with any company to be reimbursed, it is very helpful to remain calm. They will do more for the calm person than the angry one. Save the anger for if they don't help lol.
I don’t think I could act angry if I tried haha if anything I’m too passive. I imagine I’m going to go in Monday, explain the situation and be super honest. My biggest fear is I won’t be persistent enough. But I’ll try my best...
Be persistent! Especially if they try to blame you.

That said, they will probably apologize and help fix it to some extent. People tend to be pretty nice, especially if you are honest. I added the anger stuff because sometimes it's hard to not end up fuming. Persistence will get you far though. Also, keep us updated! I'm too invested now.
Haha I’ll keep you updated. I dunno how to even do an update tho? Do I just edit the post?
And that is a question for a Redditor who is more experienced than I am. I have no clue. Probably edit? Maybe add a comment and pin?
Yes please do it this way. You are telling the truth. They did not properly inform you so at least they can give you a massive discount.
I think usually people just make a new post that says "Update: *insert title of old post here*" and include links in to the old post.. Plus pot a link to the update in this post.
Yeah you can edit your original post.  Just add "UPDATE: blah blah blah" at the top or bottom and you're golden.
Do you have a friend or family member who would help? If it doesn't go well, someone else could call in to the hotel or corporate for you later. My mom is very nonconfrontational, and I've pretended to be her a few times to get things taken care of.
You don't need to be angry, you need to be firm. This is their mistake not yours and you're not paying for it, period.
I have a similar issue with being too nice! :) I've found a few tricks to manage it:

Have a few answers in your mind to questions they may ask, have a few comparisons to fall back from (Like the other posters one about the mini-bar, water, food etc all having price sheets on). Always ask what their standard protocol is and if it was followed as it's unlikely for you to be the first to have had this issue.

Worst case make a list of the sequence of events and questions on a notepad and keep it tucked in a bag or something so you can pull it out if needed. Don't admit fault as you did nothing wrong.

If it goes bad and they blankly refuse and start to throw blame around then start writing notes of who said what. I've noticed this really has a funny effect on people, if they ask why you simply say I want to be able to remember what happened in case I need to refer back to it later. Usually scares the hell out of people and makes them as uneasy as I normally am in these situations :)

**This next bit is most important:** If the manager or whomever does anything that isn't a full waiving of the charge end the meeting by thanking them for their time, tell them you still disagree that there's any charge at all and will consider your options and get in touch shortly.

Don't feel pressured to make a yes/no decision on the day even if they offer a partial discount. Even if you decide to pay full/partial amount do it after the day so you have time to think. Most mistakes I make are in the moment where lots of information has been passed between two parties and I haven't had time to let it all sink in properly. Walking away and having time to think is powerful.

No. He never said it was complimentary. They would ask him and he will say no. If your in an area with audiotape and video theyll call your bluff.
If you arent persistent, youre about to be out 300 bucks... thats way too much money to lose on something like laundry. This is one of those times where you have to step out of your comfort zone. You can do it!!! We have faith in you.
Politeness goes a long way too I would always try that first. If they walk all over you though then it is time to get mad. I use to travel a lot for work too and I always found politeness always got me farther with shitty situations and if I did get mad it meant more because they realize I not just some jerk to walk over.
And if not, if you paid with a credit card you can always dispute the charge as unauthorized (which it was). They’ll usually refund you.
Just ask. Realize that this service is like 100% profit, so they can easily remove it based on the misunderstanding
Call the number on your CC or Hilton corporate if the hotel can't sort you out.
Are you suggesting that she lie and say she was told it is complementary? Why would anyone assume there is free laundry service at any hotel? Have you ever stayed at a hotel with free laundry service? Heard of one?

If you walked into a restaurant and said, "hey, where are the self serve vending machines?" And they said, "We don't have self serve food here, sit down at that table and we will bring you the food you ask for".

Of course it's going to cost money. Asking for service and then refusing to pay is theft.

Be polite, but firm.
Yes
For $300, be really fucking angry. Its what you need to do to not get scammed for their predatory services.
The guy working the desk was really young. I’m hoping it wasn’t a scam but rather him just not doing his job.
Perhaps a persistent female redditor could call the front desk and pretend to be you
I'd do it but am non-female
Hotels do shady shit. The mariot was once fined by for jamming wifi signals to force guests to pay for their wifi services (read that recently).

Even if they say its a legitimate charge, you should go escelate the situation to a manager, or general manager or if none of that works, give hotel a bad review [which regardless of the outcome, you should definitely do].

If reddit were to get a hold of the hotel in question, reddit would have your back as far as giving the hotel 1 star reviews to force their hand.

The loss of revenue due to lowering their rating on google maps of yelp would be devastating for them.
Hahaha could work...
Was she told it was chargeable, or that it is a service for guests? Because if a price was not discussed, and the attendant indicated that it was no problem and to just leave it there and it would be done, then where I come from thats not going to be charged for. Reword to: i was led to believe it was complimentary by the staff and at no point was is indicated it was chargeable. Or stick with what i said, call it an unethicallifeprotop and argue word on word, he said it.
So... lie and hope you get your way? Im pretty sure they have a list, with pricing, on what each garment costs to wash. And if they had such a form, i believe that OP prob had to fill that out saying how much of each item she needs washed.
Did they actually say it was complimentary? I didn’t see anything but that OP just assumed it was
Right. What I'm saying is, if you walk into a restaurant and the waitress asks you if you'd like a hamburger, and you say yes, you can't after you've eaten the hamburger, say "But wait you didn't tell me how much it cost first so now I don't have to pay."

If you're in a restaurant, you're going to be charged for your food. When you're in a hotel, you're going to be charged for room service laundry service sizes all sorts of crap like that. no one needs to tell you that there's a charge for these things, it's implied.

also I can promise that on the piece of paper that she signed when she checked in there was small print that said something along the lines of we're going to charge this card for all the shit you order.
She said she filled nothing in, therein lies my point. Unethical but its a chain hotel, their annual profits are more than a families lifetime earnings.
Even if it didn't work, what's the harm in trying?

And don't be afraid to bring up negative publicity. I find a lot of companies will back off when you tell them you're going to the local news with your story, or making sure to share it around online on review sites.

I did this once because I was not told that a $500 security deposit was NOT REFUNDABLE if I decided not to take an apartment, and it was surprising how fast they changed their tune when I told them I was really upset, and going to talk to the local news about how they are taking advantage of a young couple out shopping for their first apartment. We didn't have a lot of money, and were young, but I asked multiple times about the money they wanted to do the credit check, and was told it became the Security Deposit, which I knew comes back to you when you leave. And I made sure to leave some negative reviews online too. They contacted me and offered to refund half, and when I said I wanted the full amount back they didn't argue, as long as I took down the negative reviews and didn't go to the local news about it.
This is $300. You GET angry for this. hell, p.m. me and I'll send you my phone number if you want me to call them and yell at them for you. I'm angry on your behalf!
Haha thank you for this. I mean, I’m a very optimistic person. The only reason I’m not crying right now is because there’s a chance it could work out. And if the manager tells me to piss off, I might be able to get it figured out with Hilton customer service. Everyone’s comments here have also made me feel so much better about it all... I’m also not an angry person in general lol
You should be angry. They charged you $300 for a fuckin load of laundry. That's a huge rip off.
I work in customer service. Being angry and being an asshole will get you absolutely nowhere. 

Remain calm, yet firm. Explain that you were never told about any cost for the service up front and it was not until after the service was completed that the charges, which still were not stated, would be added to your bill.

This is an unacceptable business practice. I would be furious that they tried dinging me $300 without authorization. You have a very good leg to stand on here.

Do not back down. Don't change your demands. You are justified in not being charged. That is fair, especially since you asked if there were coin-operated machines nearby. If an associate says "no" to you, ask for their supervisor or manager. Write down all their names. It might be company policy to refuse the first request, because people are afraid of confrontation. I am a professional at telling people "no," but I understand when the company is in the wrong. This is a battle the company should not initially refuse, but be ready for it.

Again, don't back down. Don't be an asshole, but tell them that anything short of waiving the laundry service fee is unacceptable. You don't need to threaten to go to social media. I have never changed my approach because a customer made a threat.
I think this argumentation, using a non-existent order form etc. should be your A-bomb.

Be honest, tell them you haven't been informed about the cost and see what the, can do for you. If they don't present a solution that you think is appropriate, go nuclear with "show me the order form or get lost."   
IANAL, but I think this could hold up in small claims court. They can't charge you for something you didn't order (and they can prove you ordered).

On the other hand: You brought them clothes and implicitly ordered the laundry service. In a restaurant you also don't need to sign an order so they can make something for you. You just ask the waiter.

Maybe a law professional could weigh in here. Does a Hotel need a signature on a form to perform additional services like laundry? Even if you order stuff in the hotel bar and let them put the charge on the room they need your signature for it. I can't imagine it would be different for other services...
Be a mean mtf this time
That's my role in my family as well. My sister is 2 years older than me, and our voices sound almost exactly the same still, but when we were younger there was absolutely no difference when we were singing. In fact, we look nothing alike and I've been picked out of crowds before by people asking if I'm her sister based on my voice and our distinctive laugh. 

Anyway, from the time she was in 8th grade and I was in 6th, I'd break up with all of her boyfriends for her on the phone. She's a way nicer person than I am, and hates confrontation. I relish in it. Probably why she had a lot more boyfriends than I did to begin with.
Oh I'd do it. I'm a woman and I love things like this. I've gotten a free I Phone and free month of service out of TMobile before. They really screwed up, but I am a master at this.
I used to work at a Hilton. Insane that they wouldn't disclose the price before hand. I would've been scalped had I done that to a guest
Indeed. I feel like if op speaks with the manager and lets them know about the situation they will wipe the charge to make it right. Especially if op is hhonors member with gold or higher it will be comped, and maybe they'll even get a glass of wine to boot.
Ii8few4
Me too, buddy. 

Ii8few4 for life.
Sorry but what does that mean?
Just seems like our friend up there accidentally typed and posted some gibberish. I was just poking a bit of fun at them. :^)
It means li8few4.
Haha okay I feel like such a dummy lol
Lol well that clears it up
Please don’t become the next reddit thing.
If there was no sheet to sign with the costs outlined someone should be getting reprimanded. You can't just charge something to a guest at will without them signing it into their bill. 

Sounds like someone got lazy and OP should have that charge removes. This isn't hard to dispute.
Yeah, I have a feeling someone might be really regretting not giving that bit of information out come Monday.
YES. THIS. See my other comment. Please talk to the manager. They will fix this.
Same, I used to be a supervisor at a Hilton resort. I would raise absolute hell and if someone’s not helping you, ask for their higher up. Keep going till you get the GM. We comp shit allll the time, $300 is a literal drop in the bucket. You never signed anything so you will NOT pay this. Repeat it till you’re blue. You got this!!
They probably do this on the premise that discussing money is gauche or he was in a hurry and did not care. Regardless that's redickulous.
Don't you think they would refund this woman as this is obviously a huge misunderstanding? They're a huge hotel chain and I doubt they would rather have $300 than piss off a good customer, who was wronged. Seems like a decent manager would reverse this if you explained the situation calmly.
Yeah that's pretty wishy washy.

Summary:
Get back to the hotel.
They would ask him and he will say no.
I work in customer service.
I used to work at a Hilton.
You think this would work?
You GET angry for this.
She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service.
I still sort of do.
So I go about my day.
Asking for service and then refusing to pay is theft.
Have you ever stayed at a hotel with free laundry service?
Why would anyone assume there is free laundry service at any hotel?
Of course I don’t have that sort of money.
I can't imagine it would be different for other services...
Of course it's going to cost money.
Don’t be nice, for once.
Ask them to present the signed form for the laundry as you were told it was complimentary.
Don't bring up your points.
Not sure what I’m going to do.
I used to work in the hotel and hated how the guests could get away with almost anything.
She also asked me what amount I could pay towards the $300 bill.
I didn’t see anything but that OP just assumed it was.
They have to have a charge sheet for it.
I’m the same way, I don’t want to get mad at minimum wage workers.
And if the manager tells me to piss off, I might be able to get it figured out with Hilton customer service.
He never said it was complimentary.
I mean, I’m a very optimistic person.
If you're in a restaurant, you're going to be charged for your food.
I'm not *telling*, again I was suggesting a possibility for consideration.
Get my laundry and thank the girl.
You never signed anything so you will NOT pay this.
If they walk all over you though then it is time to get mad.
But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests.
Do I just edit the post?
I’m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.
So... lie and hope you get your way?
In a restaurant you also don't need to sign an order so they can make something for you.
Politeness goes a long way too I would always try that first.
