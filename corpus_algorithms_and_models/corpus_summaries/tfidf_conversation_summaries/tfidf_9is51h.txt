Same here.  Thinking about cheating soon. With a fleshlight.
lol. I have a feeling this if the male / female dynamic in most straight relationships. 

We need more blowjob queens.
Tried it and it ain't worth it to me
Or just women that return the favor at least
I don't know how women who don't give blowjobs have boyfriends.
She use to but now she prolly bored or not sexually attracted to me enough to want to

But I'm not trippin it's plenty of girls that will
You ever feel like cheating?
I use to but now she finally "realized" she was attracted to others guys so we have an open relationship
Oh. Cool.
This resonates with me so hard, lol. It sucks.
There are plenty of girls who love giving head tho even with broken jaws you gotta find em
I hear you. Doing my best. :p

Summary:
I love being asked she hates it.
I love giving she hates it.
