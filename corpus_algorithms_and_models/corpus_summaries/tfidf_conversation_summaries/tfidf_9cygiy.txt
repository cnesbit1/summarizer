Original Response:
To those who believe we have libertarian free will:

Say hypothetically, your libertarian free will is removed and you're reduced to merely having compatabalistic free will.

What would this situation feel like subjectively to you? It's one thing to pose the usual question of how you could tell if another being had free will, but if it happened that you had no free will anymore, do you think would you notice any difference in yourself introspectively?

My position is that since we don't have any, it would be just like now, and that our feelings of thinking about, desiring and choosing things, and our perception that we "could" have done something else other than what we did, are all compatible (heh) with determinism.
