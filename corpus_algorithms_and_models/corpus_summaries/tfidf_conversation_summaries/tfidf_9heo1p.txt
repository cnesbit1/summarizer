Original Response:
I often hear that, as long as two people are monotheistic, they believe in the same God. I want to discuss the validity of this statement.

This is often claimed as a way to harmonize belief systems like Islam and Christianity in that, though they have doctrinal differences, they worship the same God. This God is the creator of the universe. But the Islamic concept of God and the Christian concept of God aren't one-to-one. For example, God is triune in Christianity but not in Islam where it's a sin to even claim such. I posted a thread yesterday dealing with the nature of omniscience and I got responses from multiple Christians, some of which said that God does not know the future and some which claimed he does. So there's disagreement even between individuals within the same faith.

Let's do a thought experiment. There's a married couple. Their names are Alice and Bob. You and I both believe they have one child. If I say the child is a 6 foot black man and you say the child is a 3 foot white girl, can we really say we're talking about the same person just by the fact that we both believe this is Alice and Bob's only child? There are such stark differences between our descriptions.

Apply this thought process to the multitude of different and sometimes mutually exclusive things people ascribe to this thing they call "God". 

Person A believes God is triune, cannot see the future, feels emotions, and is the creator of the universe.

Person B believes God is one, can see the future, does not feel emotions, and is the creator of the universe.

Can we really say they believe in the same God because they both believe in an intelligence creating the universe?

Summary:
This God is the creator of the universe.
