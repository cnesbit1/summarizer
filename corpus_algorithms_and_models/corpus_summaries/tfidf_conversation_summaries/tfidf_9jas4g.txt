What are you talking about my dog reacts to himself in the mirror all the time. Pretty sure he knows it's him too because he doesn't freak out at it lol

Smell is a huge thing for dogs to interact with. Reflections have none and that causes them (as far as I know) to either growl (they cant identify the ither dogs intent) or be overly curious about the world behind the looking Glass.

Lol my puppy stares at herself in the mirror. No barking, no attacking or playing. She just knows she's pretty. XD

This is highly unlikely. In fact, the "mirror test" has been shown to be fallibale. Dogs have been observed recognizing self in other ways, especially through smell.
Ive heard about the mirror test being flawed, but the claims against it seem a bit flawed aswell. I should read more about it before i say anything though. Maybe they do have a sense of self but through sight it seems very clear most dont grasp it.
IIRC they developed a "smell test" that mimics the mirror test for use in dogs and they responded much better to that
