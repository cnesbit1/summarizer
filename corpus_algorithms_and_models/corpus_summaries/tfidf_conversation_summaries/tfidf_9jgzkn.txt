Ford, Ramirez, Swetnick.

Bye.
3 separate allegations. Try again.
Establishes a pattern of behavior further corroborated by friends of the victims, friends of the accused, and the accused himself.
Except none of the friends of the accused agree with the accusation, and everyone who was there or potentially there has no recollection. 

Your politics are getting in the way of whatever faith you may claim to have.
Mark Judge could testify. The Senate won’t let him. Or maybe they’re afraid that he would actually corroborate Dr. Ford?

I’m just saying that if he’s telling the truth, the Senate should hear it from him under oath. He was the only other person said to be in the room. 

And as an aside I really should change my flair since I identify more as Catholic, but that’s neither here nor there.
Ah right I forgot the standard of plausability rests on whether the friends of the accused agree with the accusations
The person to whom I was responding brought up the friends of the accused. Take your complaint up with them.
Hmm. So more hearings and more delay? I can see why people would go for that....
I'm going to say basically the same thing I said about Moore:

I understand and accept that the most likely outcome here is a conservative filling that seat. This is about not letting a sexual predator fill that seat, and I sure as hell won't be told it's my religious or patriotic duty to let that happen.
What’s the hurry? It’s not like the Republicans are going to lose the Senate, and even if they do it won’t take effect until January. 

Scalia’s seat was held open for over a year waiting for Trump to be elected. What’s the hurry this time?

Summary:
The person to whom I was responding brought up the friends of the accused.
The Senate won’t let him.
