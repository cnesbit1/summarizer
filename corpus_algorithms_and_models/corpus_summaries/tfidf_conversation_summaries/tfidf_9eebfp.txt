Original Response:
There is no greater win for Mr.Trump than to have **EVERY** auto manufacturing job to move from Canada back to the American *Rust Belt*, unfortunately, the virtue signalling gender-balanced cabinet can't explain that to JR. The Sycophantic media is not doing their job and ringing **ALARM BELLS** over the pending trap (1/7 of Canadian jobs are tied to the auto industry)
Those are scary figures. Maybe we should diversify our economy.
we are, into a diversified culture where the CeeBeeZee is larger than all other media outlets... combined
I like most aspects of the CBC and I believe having it benefits the country.
really? how much do you *Personally* contribute directly per year?
What do you mean? Part of my taxes pays for it, correct?
Oh so you support them as long as I am FORCED to pay for them? You don't actually pay for what you consume just what the *others* contribute?

Why am I forced to pay for your entertainment? You are not forced to pay for mine...
That's a pretty selfish assessment. There are government services that my tax dollars pay for that I do not use. We do it to create a better society for all Canadians.
Pierre(skippy) Poilievre (cpc mp)  is that you ? user name sounds right lol
I would prefer rather than the Billion spent entertaining you be spent on the Homeless Canadians and our Veterans... but that is pretty selfish of me to get between you and your CeeBeeZee

sound like him a whiny little turd
Then make it a campaign issue for all the bitching done about cbc on the right contact Scheer for fuck sakes. 

I'd like some more tax dollars to educate you Pierre.
We are too dumb and stupid to do so. We need larger ports to export our goods to other trading partner s and the goods that other countries want to buy from us is unfortunately precious metals, agriculture and raw materials.

But we are too restrictive. CN would need to double rail capacity and twin new lines just to meet the needs of agriculture alone.
no jobs are gonna move on words as completely hollow and capricious as the orange monkey's
Yes because you apparently think you just blow the rust off 30 year old manufacturing equipment, add a little oil and it will start right up just like in the moves.  Lol, thanks for the laugh.
You mean like how they are a source of facts and don't try to mislead the public as much as all other outlets in North America?
Do you support American Dairy?  I bet you do and they get most of their profits from US tax dollars.  Why you so conflicted?

Summary:
Why am I forced to pay for your entertainment?
You are not forced to pay for mine...
Oh so you support them as long as I am FORCED to pay for them?
