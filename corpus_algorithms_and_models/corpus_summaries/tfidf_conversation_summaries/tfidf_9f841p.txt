Original Response:
Just for fun, lets look back at the last ten entry drafts. In hindsight, who should have gone first and second overall? Obviously the last couple years are probably too close to call, but it’s worth a look. If you could go back in time and whisper advice to the GM, who would you suggest?

Lots of other big names in each draft, of course, but this is a start. Who would you draft first and second overall?
Year| 1| 2
---|---|----
2008| Karlsson | Stamkos
2009 | Tavares | Hedman
2010 | Seguin | Hall
2011 | Kucherov | Scheifele
2012 | Forsberg | Lindholm
2013| MacKinnon | Barkov/Jones
2014 | Ekblad | Draisaitl
2015| McDavid | Eichel
2016| Matthews | Laine
2017| Hischier| Patrick
This is it for me, but I'd be pretty easily convinced if someone told me Pastrnak should go 2nd in 2014.
I had him instead of Draisaitl, but I decided the fact that Drai pays center gives him the bump. It's really close though
Meh, I'm on the Pastrnak side of things. I think he carries more weight but its a good argument both ways.
Looking back on my choices, it's really a toss up between Ekblad, Draisaitl, and Pastrnak. Depending on team needs any could go first
Definitely not taking Ekblad over Draisaitl at this point.
Pastrnak and Draisaitl are both currently a fair bit better than Ekblad as of now so you might be right.
Ekblad should be the one bumped out.
2012...geesh. I’d draft Vasi over Lindholm if I was a gm. And the jury is still out on 2017. Heiskanen is looking very good. Pettersson in Vancouver looks to be very good. This year will reveal a lot more.
Probably just being a homer but I taker Rielly over Lindholm aside from that think you got it
Petterson over Patrick for sure
Slow down, Pettersson has yet to play a game.

Patrick also started shakey but the final few months he was looking solid out there.  Pettersson could very well pass Patrick, but in no way is he sure fire better AT ALL right now

Edit: I’m a Toronto fan who grew up hating Philly and watching the Sedins
Idk, I don't have a stake in it and I think Lindholm was the best defenseman taken in that draft.  I might have Vasilevsky over both of them and Forsberg, though.
Pretty much agree with this except 2012, I think Hellebuyck is a better pick than a 60point forward although I am biased.
People underrate solid production in the NHL as an 18 year old.

Doing what Patrick did in the NHL last year is much more impressive than what Petersson did in a much worse league imo.
"MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE" ok then.
Yes...MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE
I think he’s a bit of a risk because he’s just had one season
Patrick played in the NHL, and I think I’d have Heiskanin above Petterson anyway
Like 40% of center but center I guess
I'd pay close attention to Rielly this year then. He really had a breakout last season.
100% yes.

Summary:
I’d draft Vasi over Lindholm if I was a gm.
Looking back on my choices, it's really a toss up between Ekblad, Draisaitl, and Pastrnak.
Petterson over Patrick for sure.
Pettersson in Vancouver looks to be very good.
Ekblad should be the one bumped out.
Patrick played in the NHL, and I think I’d have Heiskanin above Petterson anyway.
Heiskanen is looking very good.
Pastrnak and Draisaitl are both currently a fair bit better than Ekblad as of now so you might be right.
