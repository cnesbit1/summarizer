Need some advice on how to tackle interview questions that catches people off guard, for eg. "what is one special talent that you would like to showcase?"

1) lean back and whisper. You'll establish a dominant physical position

2) Change the location of the meeting at the last second. Throws people off

3) decline to speak first. Makes them uncomfortable and puts u in control
Michael?

If you can't convince them, confuse them.
whatever you do, remember that it is perfectly ok to stop and think for a few moments (but not too long of course) to try and think of an answer. you do not have to blurt out something on the spot - always gather your thoughts even if you instantaneously think of something, and speak deliberately.

I have always found the best way to deal with most questions is to tie to back to a core story (this isn't really a real interview technique but adapted from another discipline) - I go into the interview with a very prepared and consistent story of who I am, why am I good at, what can I bring to the table, and what I am looking for. no matter how strange the question is, even if I give a slightly weak answer, as long as I tie it back to my core story - I should be able to leave an impression in the interviewer's mind. 

its quite a mental exercise, but you can start off by crafting your own core story like "i am a very enthu redditor who is here to change the world through my keyboard warrior skills". every of your answers should tie back to that. once you get the fundamentals pat down, then you work to inject subtlety, wit, humour, some self-deprecation, deadpan...whatever you want. 

go through 30 interviews...and you become a cool calm collected actor of the highest order. every question polishes you.
don't forget to mimic body language
I see, i always find myself in a panic to blurt answer immediately in interviews and presentations, gotta fix that up.

I also find it hard to strike a balance between being confident and arrogant in an interview

Will try your advice about establishing a core story, thanks!
yup, even if you feel panicky, just remind yourself that it is ok to pause and think. 

the "core story" method for me works because if I am completely out of ideas when faced with a tough question, I just try to find something that is somewhat truthful which relates to my core story. the core story thing also works very well for scenarios that require the elevator pitch or a quick 1-2 liner about yourself, or if they ask you to give an introduction at the start or some broad brush question about why are you the best for this role.
