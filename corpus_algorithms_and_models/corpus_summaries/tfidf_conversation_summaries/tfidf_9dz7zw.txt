Original Response:
A friend of mine believes that there's nothing you can do, that is that bad for God to send you to Hell, and I share this view, but now I'm curious what would happen to someone like Hitler? Would he be forgiven for the bad things he did? Would he be sent to Purgatory? Or would he go to hell? 

EDIT: Hey everyone, thanks for commenting and giving your thoughts and opinions! It's really interesting to see them all. Sorry for asking a pretty dumb question, but I was curious as to what people thought. Enjoy your day/night, everybody!
Hitler is not a worse sinner than you and me.
Yes he is. I’m sorry but I never murdered millions of Jews, millions of homosexuals, black people, and those who didn’t have blond hair and blue eyes.
Luke 18:10-14 - Jesus telling a parable.

&gt;“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, **I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.** I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”
That parable is about humility and pride.

It's hardly a matter of pride to know that you haven't committed some of the most heinous crimes in the history of humankind.
"Humility and pride" aren't some abstract concepts. These are thoughts we have when we think we are or aren't better (in God's standard) than others. Not being a criminal only matters on a human standard, and yeah Hitler and others committed crime which should not be tolerated. However if God is perfect as the Bible says, then any amount of sin makes us the worst criminals equally.
I think it's crazy how we've taken verses that are meant to emphasize how extremely holy God is and twist them into this weird message about how shoplifting makes you LITERALLY HITLER.
There’s a lot of false doctrine in Christianity and that is one of them.

I’m talking about the other guy.
If you break the smallest part of the law, you are guilty of breaking it all
Yaaqob did not mean if you committed murder you also committed deceit. He was saying, if you commit murder, you are a transgressor of Torah. I doubt you observe Torah.
Its almost like when it becomes acceptable to believe things that don't make sense as long as a religious tradition says it that many of them will veer into bizarre nonsense.

It was not Yeshua and that’s not what he meant. He meant, if you broke of the commands, you would be a transgressor of Torah, not if you steal, you are suddenly Hitler. Even if that means you did, that still doesn’t mean all sins are equal. Check this out:
&gt; ““Whoever, then, breaks one of the **least of these commands**, and teaches men so, shall be called **least in the reign of the heavens**; but **whoever does and teaches them**, he shall be called **great in the reign of the heavens.**”
‭‭Mattithyahu (Matthew)‬ ‭5:19‬ ‭TS2009‬‬http://bible.com/316/mat.5.19.ts2009

I bet you don’t observe Torah so why does that matter to you?
You do realise Hitler didn't just kill everyone without blonde hair and blue eyes right?
EvErY SiN iS EqUaL iN Gods EyEs.
That is the most ridiculous thing ever.
I think it’s about self righteousness
Paul said he was the chief of sinners.

“This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.”
‭‭I Timothy‬ ‭1:15‬ ‭NKJV‬‬http://bible.com/114/1ti.1.15.nkjv
Nice
Hate to be that guy but your knowledge of the Holocaust is completely wrong. He did not kill millions of homosexuals. 5,000-15,000 were sent to camps. He also didn’t kill millions of black people because there were barely any black people. Pretty much the only reason the black population was greater than 0 was France’s colonial WWI soldiers. 

And no, he didn’t kill anyone who didn’t have blonde hair and blue eyes. He just considered these to be features prevalent in the Aryan race and to be celebrated. He considered himself and the majority of Germans to be part of the Aryan master race despite not having blonde hair or blue eyes.
Was hitler really “guilty” of anything that I can’t point to God condoning or encouraging in the Bible?
Dude, thanks for the answer, but I'd have to disagree with you on that one. Not that I'm saying that I don't sin or something, but Hitler was responsible for millions of people's deaths.
I guess you didn’t read my comment correctly

I already said that

Summary:
He was saying, if you commit murder, you are a transgressor of Torah.
He did not kill millions of homosexuals.
I doubt you observe Torah.
Not that I'm saying that I don't sin or something, but Hitler was responsible for millions of people's deaths.
Hitler is not a worse sinner than you and me.
