Silky.  Might be hope for Ottawa after all.  Anyone know what the plan for him is this year?  I heard something about the London Knights, but I also heard they might put him in the big show, at least to start?
He's in an interesting situation right now, where he could play in Ottawa, the AHL, or London.
How can he play in the AHL?  I thought kids in junior either had to go back to Junior or go straight to the show
He came from the NCAA, so that rule doesn't apply. If he went to the CHL, then he wouldn't be able to be called up again.
Only if they came through the CHL. He didn't. His rights are owned by London should he choose that route but right now he's free from that.
He was drafted out of the NCAA, not the CHL
Thats only for people who have came from the chl.  Brady was drafted out of college, and never played in the chl, so he can play with any team he wants
Gotcha. Forgot he went the NCAA route
Oh yeah.  Thanks!
Gotcha.  Forgot he went the NCAA route. Thanks!
Oh right I forgot about that.  Thanks!
Not sure if you've been made aware yet but that's only if you were drafted from the chl.

My guess would be at least 9 games in the NHL. You don't give a guy a number 7 to send him to juniors.
