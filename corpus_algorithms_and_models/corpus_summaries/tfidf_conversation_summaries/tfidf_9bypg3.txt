Original Response:
I often see in debates people flaired "Jewish Atheist." I never see anyone flaired "Black Atheist," "Asian Atheist," or "White Atheist." Why is race a big issue for Jewish Atheists, but not an issue for other Atheists? And for that matter, while most atheists welcome debate of any religion, Jewish Atheists get very defensive and try to censor debates when the debate is about Judaism. Is "Jewish Atheism" really a form of atheism, or is it a sect of Judaism and not really atheism at all?
