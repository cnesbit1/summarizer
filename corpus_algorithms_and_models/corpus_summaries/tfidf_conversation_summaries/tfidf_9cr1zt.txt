My name is Corina and I love boxing, traveling, cooking, my husband Bob and our dog, Ernie. I’ve lived in Philly for almost two decades after moving to the US from Venezuela. It’s been a good life and only in recent years have things changed drastically on my end.
 
In 2011, I came down with an awful sinus infection. That’s all I thought it was. The doctors couldn’t figure out why my blood pressure was through the roof or what was going on. Turns out, I had something called IGA nephropathy. I was 27 years old.
 
Being diagnosed with chronic kidney disease—that rapidly progressed—wasn’t a life sentence for me. I refused to let it hold me back or get me down. I found ways to stay active, to stay positive, and to stay… myself. I didn’t want to lose a sense of myself through this diagnosis. The specialists said it could take 20 years until my kidneys would stop working. It only took 5.
 
My name is Corina, and I used to love boxing. I used to love traveling. I used to have more energy for everyday things. My husband Bob and our dog Ernie make every day a little bit easier, when I can stay awake long enough to spend time with them. Doing anything in Philly—no matter the season—is exhausting. Walking is exhausting. Talking is exhausting. Putting all of this on paper is exhausting… and terrifying, yet here I am.
 
My name is Corina, I’m 34 years old, and I need a new kidney.

My blood type is O (as in S.O.S. or O.M.G. or “O, wow that’s the universal donor blood type, so O donors are in high demand”) so that’s where things get a little trickier. 

Right now, my life isn’t the same as it used to be, and I don’t feel the same, either. But I’m still me. Still Corina. And I’m still hopeful. And I’m still patient. And a patient, too—here at Jefferson University Hospital in Philly, in case you’re local to the area.

**EDIT**

I am truly shocked by the amount of responses I have gotten so far. Not only am I hearing from people with the same disease as mine but also people who know someone that has it and is curious to learn more. This is truly amazing!

Not only are people just generally sending positive vibes, but they're offering to get tested to donate also. I'm incredibly grateful. **If you asked me to send you a donor form in the comments, could you please email me at [findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com](findingakidneyforcorina@gmail.com). It's getting hard to keep track of everyone on here! (which I guess is not a bad thing!)**

To all of you with IGA Nephropathy, kidney disease or other chronic illness, I'm happy to have helped you in any way, however small. And it makes me feel a little less alone hearing a lot of you who've gone through the same and have come out the other side feeling better!

Lastly, I will try my hardest to reply to every single one of your questions. I do need to get back to work today though! So I will chip away at this every night this week. 


**EDIT #2**

I think I was able to get to all of your questions and comments tonight! 

Again, thanks to everyone for your questions, words of support and over all positivity. I saw some really great questions and interactions, and as a newbie on Reddit it was nice to see such a huge community of people ask and answer so many questions related to IgaN, kidney disease, transplant and other chronic illness. 

To all of you who offered to help. You are amazing humans. I cannot believe how many people are willing to help a stranger. I am shocked and incredibly grateful.
You are such a brave person ! I wish i had the courage you did to talk about this. Is it ok if i ask about how dialysis is?
Dialysis sucks, I’m not gonna lie. But I do peritoneal dialysis which is done with a cycle machine over night. And it’s just a solution that goes into the peritoneum and drained a few times throughout the night. I preferred it a million times over hemodialysis which is the kind where you have to go to a center and sit there for 4 hours 3 times a week. I did that for 3 months and I HATED it. I feel emotionally and mentally a lot better on PD. 

Overall dialysis makes me feel better than when I was going on kidney failure but the main side effect I have is extreme fatigue. But I still work 9-5, which helps staying positive and useful as a person.
I was on hemodialysis for 18 months. They offered peritoneal, but I did not want to turn my home into a medical clinic. I was healthy enough to drive myself to the clinic and back for almost all the treatments. My work allowed FMLA per hour so I left work at 12:30 every day, hemo from 1-3:30, rest then home by 5:00. I am glad you were able to have the equipment available to you at home since you were so tired. The support group around you makes all the difference. Best of luck.
What is your job?
I was lucky, only had to do PD for a little less than a year. I didn't even consider doing hemo, I still wanted to travel and go camping. Received kidney when I was 27. I feel bad for people that end up on hemo dialysis that are healthy enough for PD.
I do UX design and I’m an art director
My mother was in the same situation as you at around a similar age and with the same treatment. I totally understand that it is an indescribable situation that is incredibly difficult to go through. 

Wishing you all the best and to never give up hope of finding a donor!
Thanks!
What would stop them from switching to PD? I’m so glad you got a kidney!
Also turns you house into a warehouse too lol. They literally delivered supplies on a pallet with a forklift. Crazy times looking back.
It's amazing what we're capable of when it's do or die. I was a kid who didn't like taking responsibility for anything and let my mom set up my appointments/handle my phone calls. I had also dropped out of high school and wasn't doing anything with my life. Well, I got sick and all of a sudden it was an immediate mentality shift. I was handling everything, keeping track of many different medicines (6 times a day, roughly every 2 hours, I had to take different pills). I suffered through 80 lbs of water weight in my legs (so much that I couldn't walk up steps because my skin was too tight. Moving any way other than like a penguin would cause excruciating pain) among many other things.

The point isn't to take away from OP's resilience, but to hopefully help you realize that you very likely have it in you, too, you've just never been forced to show it. I was probably the least likely candidate to have my shit together should shit go down, but I did it, so you can, too, if the need arises (and hopefully it doesn't!)
I do home hemodialysis, I dont know if it is offered everywhere, I live in Ontario Canada.  Basically I have the full hemo machine in my house and I am trained to run it.  I started on PD but I never really felt good doing it, Home Hemo has been the answer for me.
Yea everyone is different for sure. I'm glad you're doing well on hemo!
Do they offer home hemodialysis where you live.  I was on hemodialysis for 7 years, 3 of which were at home.  Home hemodialysis is around 2.5 hours 5 days a week.  You get to set your own schedule and is supposed give you better clearance than in-center hemodialysis since you are doing it more often.  The only "scary" part is that you have to put in your own needles.  But isn't as big a deal since I had button holes.  With button holes the needle isn't sharp, you just stick a blunt needle into a hole that is created by the dialysis nurse.  

Have you also considered going out of state?  Places like southern Florida offer shorter wait times for transplant.  I was told to look for states without helmet laws as they will have younger people who are potential donors (kind of morbid but that's what it is).

Even though this a throwaway account I'll check back if you have any questions.  I finally got my kidney in 2012 and it has been live changing.
Hi Corina!

My questions might seems a bit impersonal, sorry if they do. I'm a graduate student stundying immunology, so the disease you're dealing with is interesting to me from a science perspective.

Did they genotype you at any point to figure out if a known mutation was causing your case of IgA nephropathy? Do you know if you have a family history of kidney disease or lung or intestinal problems? Do you still have your tonsils? Have you tried any of the dietary changes that might slow progression?

Hope you find a donor and get back to boxing in the near future.
(If it helps, I have IGA &amp; my dad is a celiac. Lots of interesting research suggesting that it's a similar condition manifesting in different organs.)
Did didn’t genotype me, I’ve only been seen by nephrologist, but I saw a integrative doc and did a few studies on my gut health and what not and she suggested that I go gluten free... that didn’t really do much for me. I also went vegan for a while... also didn’t do much at all.

My 82 year old uncle is also on dialysis but not issues when he was young.

No other major family history, other than high blood pressure on my dad’s side. 

I still have my tonsils.

I do wish there was more info about what causes it, what I can tell you is that whenever I had a cold or any upper respiratory thing I would see blood in my urine... so things would get flared up.
i know someone with igA as well, he figured out it was caused by allergies though the doctors he saw refused to say there was a link. have a look at this https://www.karger.com/Article/PDF/185266
Not OP, but transplant recipient here. Six years strong. I suffered from IgN. When diagnosed I was treated with blood pressure medicine and eventually had my tonsils out. I laughed when my nephrologist recommended that procedure. It did not slow down the progression of the disease. Dietary habits did nothing as well. It progressed very rapidly. My mother and I always suffered from "stomach issues". I also caught c-diff post-transplant. Horrible. 

I was on dialysis for approx seven months during transplant work up. I also had a scare with TB from nearby dialysis patient who tested positive. That nearly set me back. 

Creatin, BP, tacrolimus levels all are good. I take Imuran as well.
It's not caused by allergies, though it may be related to them (yes there could be a link, doesn't mean the link is causation).
&gt;she suggested that I go gluten free

The idea there is that gluten can be an antigen - something the immune systems "sees" and responds to. Cutting gluten might reduce overall immune response (we often think of that as inflammation) in the gut, which is typically the major site of IgA production. Thereby reducing IgA production. But the evidence of this working is thin.

&gt;I do wish there was more info about what causes it

From what I can tell, it looks like multiple causes on a genetic level. A handful of gene mutations are assocaited with IgA nephropathy, some more obvious than others (so IgA mutations, but also mutations in other proteins). But yeah, mechanism isn't clear.

&gt;what I can tell you is that whenever I had a cold or any upper respiratory thing I would see blood in my urine... so things would get flared up.

This generally makes sense. IgA is the major antibody type in mucosal sites (so the gut as a mentioned above but also the lungs, mouth, nasal pasages, &amp; genitals). An infection at those sites would be likely to induce more IgA expression. So then you'd see symptoms after a lung or sinus infection, probably also after a stomach infection but those aren't as common in adults.

Incidentally, when you saw blood in your urine after an infection, do you know the timeline? Like, generally a few days after infection symptoms? Or a week or more?

​
Hey, to clarify, is that IgN or IgM? If that's IgM it would kinda make sense to take out tonsils, but only kinda. Not saying your doctor was off the wall - just that if I had to guess, I'd guess that's a treatment option that might work for some folks and not others.

Glad you're doing well now!
As someone who has HLRCC I suggest you get the DNA test to see if you have the FH gene mutation for HLRCC.
They typically diagnose it using a kidney biopsy and a process of elimination tests. Per my nephrologist, there are no direct tests to confirm IGA nephropathy except to look at the damage. And they put you on a low protein diet with ACE inhibitors. Sometimes they try high dose methylprednisone. These kind of slowed it down for me but only for 2 years. One of my hunches is that prednisone works to slow it down but my doctor didn't want me to take it long term due to side effects. I kind of agree with him on that.
I have IGA nephropathy and they have never seen blood in my urine. I don't know the exact infection that triggered it.
Wait, explain the tonsils thing?
Can you offer some clarification on  the significance of this disease and the role tonsils may/not play?

I'd like to learn a bit more about this.
The way my doctor described it to me, and if I remember correctly, is that when you get a tonsil infection, the body sends antibodies (IgA) over there to fight the disease. Somehow, those antibodies will travel to the kidneys as well. The problem is, those antibodies can't distinguish between bad and good, so when they arrive at the kidneys they start fighting those as well. The doctor said that it's easy for germs/antibodies to travel from the tonsils to the kidneys, I assume it's not easy for the rest of the body. So when you get a tonsil infection, it will damage your kidneys as well, to the point where it may actually worsen and speed up the progression of the overal disease. That's why removing the tonsils is sometimes advised. It's not a cure, but it may help prevent damage in the future.
You seem knowledgeable on this subject. How many cases of pathophysiology do you see that are correlated to genetic mutations? Even more so protein based mutations?
I would say there are two main components:

 * A trigger that causes an IgA immune response
 * The IgA antibodies coagulating into chains

For me dairy (bovine albumin?) was the primary cause of extreme attacks of fatigue (usually would cause me to fall asleep for a few hours). Raw steak and also raw egg white could also trigger it.

A biopsy confirmed IgAN (and also membranous nephropathy). Avoidance of dairy eliminated the extreme sleepiness attacks.

In order to treat IgAN you could either try to remove all IgA triggers, or try to prevent the IgA chains forming.

I took calcium disodium EDTA sublingually ([warning - there are two kinds of EDTA - if you take the wrong one you may die](https://www.chelationwatch.org/reg/fda_warning.shtml)) as there was [one case in the literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1292346) of a patient whose IgA deposits disappeared (temporarily I would presume). I am not convinced it improved anything as far as preventing IgA chains forming. However there has been at least [one study that claimed that EDTA helped decelerate renal decline](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/22/10/2924/1831338).

I was taking a mercury chelating drug (DMPS) to treat the membranous nephropathy (now in full remission). Mercury is well-known to antagonise the immune system, and after a year or two I found I could tolerate dairy food sources without falling sleep.

My kidney function is normal. I still occasionally have sleep attacks, and obviously IgAN is incurable (unless you blast the immune system with chemo to reboot it, which is not a permanent solution and also carries many risks). Previously dairy would trigger falling asleep 95% of the time, now I would say it's very rare, maybe 1-2% of the time. It may be that the DMPS has reduced system-wide levels of mercury, and this has moderated the immune system's response to foreign proteins.

If anyone reading this has IgAN, I would suggest investigating food allergies as a possible trigger. This is not to say that food allergies are the primary cause, but may be one of the causal components, along with genetics, that combine to cause problematic IgA immune responses.
It's controversial whether IgM is a real entity or just a secondary biopsy finding MCD/FSGS/MPGN. Tonsil removal is actually standard practice in Japan where the incidence of IgA is highest.  As you said, it works for some and not others. 

Basically the pathophysiology of IgA Nephropathy is renal mesangial deposition of oligo-glycosylated IgA1. This abnormal IgA1 is due to a genetic defect in IgA production. One of the sites of production are the tonsils, thus the recommendation for removal. Of course, there are other production sites as well (Peyer’s patches) and thus variable response rates.
As someone who also has IGA Nephropathy, here are my answers.  Haven't been genotyped, no family history of kidney disease, although a history of intestinal issues.  I still have my tonsils.  Dietary changes that I implimented helped but they were very restrictive and difficult to maintain.  For me it was no red meat, no dairy, no gluten.  It was effective in reducing the creatinine and blood count but very difficult to stay on, currently I am being treated by a combination of Lisinopril and Amlodipine Besylate.
IgAN is differentiable from lupus because of the rapidness of hematuria following upper respiratory infection (along with high levels of IgA complexes in glomerulus but you need a biopsy for that). Usually less that 1 week for IgAN and over 1 week for lupus.

Have you ever heard of hematuria as a result of taking a dietary immunoglobulin-g supplement?
No, but my work is not clinical.

Looking for dietary IgG supplements, the ones I can find are bovine derived (cow IgG). I'm not sure what they're purporting to treat, but I would not trust those supplements to have any impact.  They contain IgG, but IgG is just one specialized protein and it's function depend on intact structure and what epitope a given IgG  binds. There's no evidence the IgG in those supplements is intact after packaging. If it is intact it's unclear if any would make it out of the gut into the bloodstream. In the absence of those things it's just a pill with a little extra protein, like eating a piece of freeze-dried, powdered steak.
I don't see clinical samples. I do basic reasearch on some receptors that might be involved in IgA nephropathy, but looking at the evolution of those receptors. So VERY removed from the clinical treatment side of things.

&gt;How many cases of pathophysiology do you see that are correlated to genetic mutations? Even more so protein based mutations?

I did a cursory search in PubMed and looked at mutations associated with IgA nephropathy. The mutations are of interest to me in understanding potential molecular and cellular mechanisms, but I don't have any sense for patient correlation - probably low since it's not one single clear mutation that's easy to look for and diagnose. But I thought there was a chance the OP had been geneotyped during treatment, or had participated in a study genotyping to evaluate mechanisms of this disease.

&amp;#x200B;
Not what I was asking. I asked OP about timing because I wanted to see if her case anecdotally lined up with a memory response not a de novo class switch to IgA.
Interesting. That makes sense. To be clear, the IgG supplement was in a protein powder supplement, I wasn't trying to get more IgG, it was incidental.

I was experiencing hematuria and got diagnosed as Stage 1 IgA Nephropathy from this symptom alone. When I stopped taking a protein supplement which contained bovine IgG I stopped experiencing hematuria. I had repeatedly told every specialist I saw that I was taking a protein supplement, but didn't realize it had IgG in it until reading the fine print later. IIRC, the nephrologists said I didn't have protein in my urine and no abundance of the acid that excess protein creatine can create so they weren't really worried about the protein powered.
IgM is very much a "real entity." You mean it may not be impacting disease in biopsy findings, and be incidental to disease progression?

&gt;Basically the pathophysiology of IgA Nephropathy is renal mesangial deposition of oligo-glycosylated IgA1. This abnormal IgA1 is due to a genetic defect in IgA production. 

It's not that simple, though that's one potential cause. The glycosylation of IgA could be altered after production and secreation of IgA. Mutations in the complment cascade and the involvement of C3 and other late complement proteins point to multiple genes and proteins involved in IgA nephropathy (that's just one example). There are likely also involvement of complement and IgA receptors. Mutations or changes in expression of any of those proteins might contribute in an individual case of IgA nephropathy.

&amp;#x200B;
&gt; When I stopped taking a protein supplement which contained bovine IgG I stopped experiencing hematuria.

That's weird. You might have been having inflammation related to the IgG proteins or other components. Or it might ahve been coincidental if you had some other treatment start around that time. (Or somethings else entirely.)
Yeah... I need to go get a PCP and a checkup.

Thanks for answering my question!
I had a stomach flu a few months ago I had blood in my urine and needed to pee every hour or so even if it was a few drops.  That night the flu took over and I was vomiting and shaking all night. My urine was back to "normal" within 48  hours after the flu passed if I remember correctly.
How is life post transplant?  I assume you are still living with IgN?  Are you back to regular daily meds and monitoring your urine and blood?
I mean that the deposition of IgM may not be pathogenic itself but is rather a by-product of some other disease process. 

True there are probably many defects along the pathway - but as of right now there isn’t much that can be done clinically. Hence the routine tonsillectomies in Japan.
Life is great. I recognize how fortunate I truly am and receiving a transplant has increased my quality of life ten fold. Two BP meds and two immunosuppressive meds. Could be worse I suppose.
Thanks for the suggestion!
Hey /u/wobblebase , to help you out, I talked to my friend /u/whalesharksarecool and she said this about tonsils:

*"There is a redittor with IGA neuropathy, and in the comments of the IAMA, there is someone studying Immunology, and they were wondering  Did they genotype you at any point to figure out if a known mutation was causing your case of IgA nephropathy? And also for some reason if you still have your tonsils.* 

 

They did not genotype me. I do still have my tonsils. That was never seriously considered as a therapy for me as My IGA was well-established in my kidneys by the time it was found and they didn’t think it could help."

Hope this might help your study/project.

Summary:
I still have my tonsils.
I do still have my tonsils.
Not what I was asking.
I have IGA nephropathy and they have never seen blood in my urine.
Do you still have your tonsils?
I take Imuran as well.
Turns out, I had something called IGA nephropathy.
As someone who also has IGA Nephropathy, here are my answers.
I used to love traveling.
I do need to get back to work today though!
Received kidney when I was 27.
I was 27 years old.
(which I guess is not a bad thing!
I assume you are still living with IgN?
And also for some reason if you still have your tonsils.
It did not slow down the progression of the disease.
Did they genotype you at any point to figure out if a known mutation was causing your case of IgA nephropathy?
But I still work 9-5, which helps staying positive and useful as a person.
To all of you who offered to help.
My name is Corina, and I used to love boxing.
I was on hemodialysis for 7 years, 3 of which were at home.
I don't see clinical samples.
I’m so glad you got a kidney!
The specialists said it could take 20 years until my kidneys would stop working.
I kind of agree with him on that.
I don't know the exact infection that triggered it.
Even more so protein based mutations?
I was on hemodialysis for 18 months.
