Pulling him across? Holtby grabbed onto Aho.
Yeah, the ref's arm was up for either a hook or interference, so...
It was for a hook from Orlov. Nothing to do with Holtby who was interfered with.
Yeah, you could see Orlov pushing Aho straight in to Holtby.
What, no you couldn't.   
Aho just had too much speed and no good exit and ran into Holtby.  
It was a hook and it was interference. Shouldn't have been a goal though, but Rierden didn't want to waste a time out in the pre-season.
Aho had the speed, but Orlov was clearly going as fast behind Aho. Take a look tomorrow from replays, watch Orlovs right hand. It stretches out right before they enter the goalie area.   
As far as that goal´s considered viable, that´s up to the ref.  


I wouldn´t waste the tie-out either.
Saw the replay from the other side and now I do see Orlov's hand. Wasn't paying attention enough to whether it was on him or pushing. I'd assume pushing.   
 Either way I'm just gonna go homer glasses and say it's all Aho's fault cuz why not, preseason.
you can see his left arm push his hips there at the end

Oh yeah, I was wrong, they showed a better replay after the period ended. Saw it then.
I didn't see it either honestly till the reply. I was just like hey I'll take it lol.

Summary:
It was for a hook from Orlov.
Yeah, you could see Orlov pushing Aho straight in to Holtby.
