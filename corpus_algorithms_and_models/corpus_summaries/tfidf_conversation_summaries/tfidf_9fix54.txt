Original Response:
Doesn't this seem like Trump just not understanding the study that concluded 3000 deaths? 

They didn't tally up any person who died in the aftermath of the hurricane, they tallied up people who died preventable deaths that weren't prevented. These deaths are attributed directly to the lackluster response and recovery plan for the hurricane, which is on Trump much as Katrina and its' FEMA disaster was on Bush. 

The real conspiracy here is why the original death tolls only included deaths from the actual hurricane, acting as though life carried on as normal in PR starting the day after the hurricane ended.

No. The actual number is much more likely to be half that.

[Here's Eight studies (they actually make Trumps point for him)](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2018/09/13/here-are-studies-disputing-trump-claim-that-hurricane-death-toll-was-low/Jeg8g3ZJ9hIbAkJOPFEgVM/story.html)




* Average mean estimate of 8 studies is **1776.25**
* 6 of 8 the studies have estimates **below 1500**
* University of Puerto Rico mean estimate as low as **822**
* Only one study had mean estimate of a number as high as 3000 (Harvard) and their lower estimate of their offered range was **793**

Furthermore, the study that [found almost 3000 was pretty poorly conceived.](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/projects/PRstudy/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf)

its based on the difference between an estimate of how many people should die in a normal year  and an estimate of the current population, minus (yet another) estimate of how many people they think left the country... Maybe you find that rigorous but I certainly do not.
Compelling argument. 

I can totally see now why I should believe you and Trump over the George Washington University School of Public Health
Why should you believe them? Because the NWO told you they’re good?

It was always obvious that number was way lower than the actual death toll and would rise dramatically. Their electrical grid was taken out. Whole sections of the island were inaccessible. Their local governments were in disarray because local officials were also victims of the hurricanes and government offices and infrastructure were destroyed. They literally could not have an accurate death from the hurricane itself, let alone its after effects, so early after it hit. Their morgues were literally overflowing and bodies were being stored in refrigerated containers. It was really fucking obvious that *way* more than 6-18 people died in the hurricane, and that people continued to die in the aftermath.
Very valid reply!

I agree that 3000 is likely an outlier due to experimental procedure. But, and it is a large but, Trumps argument is not "3000 deaths is ridiculous, its more like 1200-1500 deaths as shown by these studies". His argument is "3000 deaths is ridiculous, its more like &lt;20 as was the case when i visited and threw paper towels to them". His fundamental argument is that there was a negligble loss of life due to how great he is, whereas every study conducted found a significant loss of life due to the residual effects of the hurricane
Ummm.......they did?
You counted?
Better than believing Trump because he said "trust me"
Not really

Big Brother saying “trust me” scares me more.
Good argument.
They didn't tally or count anything because it was likely too difficult to get reliable metrics to do physical counting with. They estimated... some studies more rigorous than others.

The number is mostly likely in the range of 1000-1500 or something like that
University studies are more "Big Brother" than the president of the United States?
Trump is big brother
How is Tump not Big Brother in this situation?

He's the fucking Pesident!
[deleted]
Because the Media and Institutions are against him. The Deep State is big brother. Not flavor of the week
Duh. They’re part of the Deep State. 

Trump is just a wild guy who managed to get in. He’s essentially under house arrest.
You guys and your Deep State bullshit.

Just keep trusting the man with a golden toilet to be on your side.

Why are you believing GWU over 8 separate studies? You're being intentionally misleading here.
64 the old official number is actually about as ridiculous as 3000. But I agree with you that Trump presented a not very well thought out opinion.

The level of downvotes from a comment I put some work in to and laid out fairly objectively.... I've been as high as +10 and as low as -10 and the score keeps changing.

Kinda insane for a reasonable disagreement don't you think?
I can’t get through the paywall, but in looking at these statistics that you presented, finding the mean doesn’t make it right. Only one of those numbers from 793 to 3000 (or maybe outside of that range) is actually right. Now I have no idea where those different numbers come from, but it seems that the 2975 number comes from 6 months after the storm due to complications from the storm and lack of resources due to the storm. Yeah, maybe only a small handful of people died from the storm in the few hours it was going on, but the result of the lack of infrastructure because of the storm killed a lot more people.

Probably because that's how EVERY OTHER natural disaster works???

The fake news here is the conspiracy.  

It's classic moving the goalpost.

If I accidentally tripped on a sidewalk which then subsequently moved a rock which tripped someone and killed them that doesn't make me a murderer.

Likewise these people may have been killed indirectly from the storm, but the inability of weak or compromised people to be self sufficient isn't the fault of the storm.
Look at the other 8 studies. I got all the estimates from there  and the ones with rrangesI added together and diveded by two to get the mean of their estimate. The last study I linked to (the one the media is quoting) sucks nuts.

Summary:
Doesn't this seem like Trump just not understanding the study that concluded 3000 deaths?
The Deep State is big brother.
