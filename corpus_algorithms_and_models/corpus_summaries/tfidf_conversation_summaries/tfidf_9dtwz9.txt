Original Response:
For these kind of unemployment trends. It's best to look at year over year data

(2017, we added 26,000 jobs. In 2016 We added 22,000 jobs)
So....the past two years averaged 24k new jobs.

This year we lost 51.6k jobs
No. Month to month numbers don't mean anything. We might add 50k jobs next month, then lose another 50k the next month after that. You have to look at the longer term trend
&gt; This year we lost 51.6k jobs

Admittedly, I could have phrased that better.  I should have said "*this year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August.*"

As for the year-long picture, [this guy's post covers that ground](https://old.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/9dtwz9/canadian_economy_lost_51600_jobs_in_august/e5kajvw/).

And it's mostly more of the same.
I don't think you understand what "in August" means
I phrased it poorly.

I should have said 

&gt; "in the past two Augusts, we averaged 24k new jobs"

&gt; "This year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August"

I can see how the way I said it would cause some confusion.
But our population went up far more than 22k.
You have to understand what "unemployment" means - First there's population, and out of that population only a certain amount of people are in the labour force (people between age 16 and 65 who's not in school or a stay at home parent, or unable to work due to disability, etc) and then out of all those people, those that are recently looking for jobs in the last 3 months are considered "unemployed" and the % between those that are looking for jobs in the last 3 months vs the labour force is the unemployment rate

What this means is that A) despite population going way more then 22K, it doesn't mean that all those people are employable (toddlers, retirees, for example) and B) for the last two years before we got around 22K less people looking for jobs in August then now.
So what is the yearly size increase of Canadas working age population?
It's pretty sad that in this day of age... people have to argue in ignorance instead of actually seeking information before stating their opinion... and they can't even bother to google stuff up before shit-posting on reddit

Here's the data that you need from 2013 to 2017

As for 2018. It's a simple matter of pulling the 18,631,000 (employment # in Canada from https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/180907/dq180907a-eng.htm and add the total uneomployment numbers)
Looks like our population is outpacing employment

Summary:
This year we lost 51.6k jobs.
I should have said "*this year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August.
