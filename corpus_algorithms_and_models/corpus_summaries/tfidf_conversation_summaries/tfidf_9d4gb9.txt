Well aside from the usual economic and diplomatic pressure, we could just threaten invasion. It's a tiny island nation with a population comparable a country town.
They rely on financial aid from Australia, granting us the leverage which let us open the camps there in the first place.

[edit] Of course that could back fire, China's been eager to grow their influence wherever they can fill the gap from the west pulling out of places like in African countries.
This is a joke right?
I'll leave that up to you ;)
Since we fund the Nauru government, they do what we want.  This is what our government wants them to do.  

Why do you think they won't give ABC journalists visas?  The gocvernment of Nauru doesn't care about the ABC, our current government does though.

Summary:
This is what our government wants them to do.
