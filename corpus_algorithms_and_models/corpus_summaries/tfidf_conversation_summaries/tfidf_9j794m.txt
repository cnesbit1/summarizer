Iâ€™ll start things off with the Jets.

1. Scheifele - 91
2. Wheeler - 83
3. Laine - 80
4. Connor - 68
5. Ehlers - 65
I don't think Laine gets 80 playing with Little
I think he plays with Roslovic
I don't think he gets 80 with a rookie center either ðŸ¤”
I still have the jets doing something similar this trade deadline as the last. Get a rental center to play with Ehlers and Laine

That could be a guy like Matt Duchene. Just throwing it out there
Even worse.
Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up. A first wont be enough and I wouldnt want to give up a Vesalainen or a Niku. 

Wtf do I know though. I figured SJ didnt have the pieces for a Karlsson trade.
That may depend. I could see it happening if the Jets are 1st in the central by a decent bit and they look primed for another run, we'll see though, I do agree that the price on Duchene won't be cheap but the Sens would be stupid not to trade him cause with each passing day it seems less and less likely he wants to stay (See Quote about Zach Smith from yesterday)
Totally agreed. They gotta ace this trade though. Can't blame them for biding their time and waiting for the right moment. Sucks he's on the shit end of it again though. Hopefully he ends up happy somewhere this time.
Maybe 80â€™s a reach but I think Roslovicâ€™s looked really good this preseason
Yeah I think if he does get traded he'll go to UFA regardless just so he can make a choice of where he wants to be cause he hasn't had the greatest luck personally the past few years
&gt; Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up

if we're basing it off EK's value then Duchene will go for a 3rd round pick

Summary:
Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up.
I think he plays with Roslovic.
