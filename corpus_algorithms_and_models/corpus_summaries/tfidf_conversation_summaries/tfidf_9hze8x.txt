Yeah was gonna comment that.
me too, just as bad if not worse iirc. edit: [oooooh yea, thats right](https://youtu.be/rbZiUtXaTOY?t=45s)
I'd say worse. Joe was really putting it on Kato in the kickboxing fight and didn't appear to be taking his foot off the gas, and then the spinning backfist.
Schilling also handled the losses pretty badly, iirc he really tried to downplay it on JRE and imply Kato was scared of him and got lucky...twice.
I only knew Joe's name from the Muay Thai circles but ever since that comment I stopped caring what Joe said. Some guys got way more skills than the other fighter, but some fighters just end motherfuckers. You can win every round in a fight but it don't mean shit if you get KOd.
He said the kickboxing one was an early stoppage.
Hahahahaha really ? Early for Yamasaki maybe, what a dickhead
why is there a cage behind that ring? lol
That's bellator kickboxing.  They now do bellator mma fights and kickboxing matches the same night.
aah diidn't know that thanks, must be a bit weird for the fighters though lol
