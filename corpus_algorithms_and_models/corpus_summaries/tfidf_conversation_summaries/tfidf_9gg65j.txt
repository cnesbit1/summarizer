Original Response:
I've seen this suggested a few times and I don't get why it's not in the game yet. It seems like it would be really easy to implement something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/7TOSdS3.jpg) (from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/70gi3k/suggestion_easier_access_to_inventory_sorting)) and would save a lot of clicking during inventory management.

edit: Does anyone think this would have any downside?
Can we please get an option to combine "Deposit All Materials" and "Compact" into **one** button?
This is the most important one, almost everyone presses both of them anyways so just make it one!
That's not even close to true.
Only as an [option](http://i.imgur.com/QOFexzt.png), please.
i do it , first, salvage all with coper fed, then deposit all, then compact 

repeating this until my bags are full of shit i cant salvage and then go to a merch and sell everything i dont need (mostly minor runes)
What? Where’s your proof?
Asking for proof of the contrarian but not the initial bogus claim OMEGALUL
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)
**Burden of proof (law)**

The burden of proof (Latin: onus probandi) is the obligation of a party in a trial to produce the evidence that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the burden of proof. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets its burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation.

Yes I am also waiting for him to post his proof. Thanks for linking it so I didn't have to.
Here’s some proof. I myself always press both. So do my friends and guildies.
And none of my friends or guildies do. Solid proof bud.
I find that hard to believe. I don’t see why anyone wouldn’t compact and deposit.
Because compact is fucking garbage and useless? Lmao what a waste of time
Can you elaborate? I like not having random junk spread out in my inventory. I prefer everything to be compact with no spaces between items. Looks very nice and organized that way.
I really hate free spaces between items in my inventory.

Also, with no spaces between, new item is always added as last.

That's exactly what I'm doing as well.

Two-in-one button would be time/click-saver.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence
**Anecdotal evidence**

Anecdotal evidence is evidence from anecdotes, i.e., evidence collected in a casual or informal manner and relying heavily or entirely on personal testimony. When compared to other types of evidence, anecdotal evidence is generally regarded as limited in value due to a number of potential weaknesses, but may be considered within the scope of scientific method as some anecdotal evidence can be both empirical and verifiable, e.g. in the use of case studies in medicine. Other anecdotal evidence, however, does not qualify as scientific evidence, because its nature prevents it from being investigated by the scientific method.

Sounds like proof to me :\^)
If you don't, you're playing the game wrong
Tbh, I don't compact either. I have a layout with different type of bags and I want items where I place them. Not saying that's universal. But that its for me.
I never compact, it fucks up the order of everything :p
"I do it so everyone must as well", projecting much?
I also never use Compact.  I put things in certain places and compact just messed it up.
Because it messes shit up in my inventory. How do you not understand that not everyone plays the way you do?? 

There are people who do it and those who don’t, saying everyone does it based on your anecdotal evidence is just bloody stupid and conceited.
Wow dude. Don’t take everything so personally. I know not everyone uses it but my argument was that the majority do.
Your argument that the “majority” do, comes from what ? Everyone you know does it ? Well everyone that I know doesn’t do it. So the majority don’t actually do it thanks very much.
No prob

Summary:
I also never use Compact.
