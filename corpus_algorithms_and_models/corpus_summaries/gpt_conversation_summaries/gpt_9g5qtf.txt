We seem to be the sexy pick this year. Can't wait for you all to be disappointed again. They got a lot of success from their insane first line, they just got to keep playing at that level. On the other hand, haven't they had defensemen go down to injury in the last 2 weeks of the seasons the past 2 seasons? defense is critical... People said we would miss the playoffs last year too Brandon Carlo back to back years. And how is it our fault our defensemen get hurt right before the playoffs. I don’t think Carlo decided he wanted to snap his ankle trying to kick a puck free or get drilled headfirst into the boards by Ovi. I don’t think Krug meant to hurt his knee and get shoved into the boards awkwardly. I don’t think Colin Miller chose to have Boro be a dirty fuck and go knee on knee. I’m pretty sure Chara and McAvoy didn’t ask for MCL injuries last season. https://www.reddit.com/r/hockey/comments/6m1laj/what_are_your_nhl_standings_predictions_for_next/ first thread i found and many were putting us missing the playoffs.
