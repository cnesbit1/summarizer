My husband knows that I'm the type of person who, if I see a woman struggling, I will help. "Hey! Oh my god! It's been SUCH a long time since I've seen you! How are you doing these days!?" I saw your confusion for a split second, then realize "this rando is trying to help me," and you played along. I explained what I saw. How the guy you were with had grabbed your shirt and backpack straps, how he aggressively demanded the keys to the car, and how you were just trying to get away. If you're a redditor, I hope you're okay. And if you're the asshole I got her away from, may your crotch be infested with the fleas of 1000 camels, and nary a person in sight to help you.
