Took nearly 700 miles but I finally made it the entire day without forgetting to cancel my indicators. I dont think I will ever feel this good again.  
ride a BMW and know the true frustration of stupid indicator/horn layout.  
I swear that Honda has 2 different Horn/Indicator layouts that change randomly when I get on my motorcycle.  
Glad to know it's not just me. It certainly doesn't help that the horn and turn signal button positions are swapped between my last and current bike that I've only had a little over a month now.  
I was trying to park in a spot by a crowd of people and missed the indicator. Just laid on the horn for a few seconds because I was so surprised and didn't realize the horn was mine for a bit. I didn't want to take off my helmet after that :/
