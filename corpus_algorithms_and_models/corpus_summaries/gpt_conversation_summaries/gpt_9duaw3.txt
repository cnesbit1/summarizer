Do you have any more pics of the build? What exactly did you change? Any balls ups or tips for someone thinking of doing something similar?  
Desert sled isn’t actually a dual sport it just looks like it is  
This handles better and is in my opinion a better off roader than the desert sled which I also extensively tested recently. It was also built 8 years before it was released :p  
First pic is Clear Mountain, I can't forget that view. Why haven't I seen you around? Also that dirt track, Lacey's Creek maybe?  
Pink Grom?? Why haven't I seen YOU around? ;) Dirt track is up Mt Nebo somewhere  
Man you might have! Although all you'd see is a pink blur.  
I've done the dirt at Laceys Creek, haven't seen the tracks on Nebo though. Looks a bit rough for my Grom.  
Haha, I have no doubt your monster handles better in its current form :P  
Beautiful 👌🏻
