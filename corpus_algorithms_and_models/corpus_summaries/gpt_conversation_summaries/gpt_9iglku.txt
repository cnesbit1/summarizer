For fuck's sake, the provinces don't *have* jurisdiction over the banking industry. Alberta already tried this once and was told no. Can't imagine Quebec would be allowed either. Here's the thing: Quebec wont ever separate, so dont even take that into consideration when choosing a party to vote for. Then vote for the party you actually prefer, and if they end up trying to separate, simply vote No at the referendum. If QS and PQ could have reconciled their differences there's a strong chance they could have rolled to at least a minority, possibly a majority, government. I don't like the mainstream choices either but the fact that we have two legit options that didn't or barely existed a decade ago gives me hope that getting in on the ground level of a fringe party could be a good thing for the future of the province. I am always surprised when people don't vote for a party in Quebec because the party is pro-separation, especially when the party does not plan on doing a referendum in its first mandate. I don't see the harm in Quebec being allowed to make more decisions that are different from the rest of Canada, as long as it pays for them itself. A non-sovereign but autonomous province of Quebec that pays for itself (or at least pays for anything new but keeps the current equalisation format) is fine for me. I am not a separatist, but the QS candidate in my riding is the only one that has talked about issues facing my riding.
