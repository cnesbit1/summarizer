For a few days my back had been hurting, but I didn’t really care, as I was in my junior year of high school and I totally didn’t care enough. Worth mentioning was that I hadn’t felt the need to poo for a full week. 

Back to the morning of February 23, I was in pain. I couldn’t sit up straight at school, I was constantly grunting to cope, but after the first few periods I was managing and it didn’t hurt me too much. 

Instead of the sight of my normally rather flat stomach, I was greeted to my body being curved. The left side of my body was considerably more concave than the right, and that’s where it lined up with the hurt in my back. Panic ensued as I informed my mother. 

Fast forward a half hour, and I’m being inspected at a clinic. Of course, the doctors there are quite perplexed, and I need an x-ray. They inform me that I should probably head to the ER, since they don’t know what to do. 

At the ER, I of course get another x-ray. They wheel me around in a wheelchair, where I’m comically hunched to the side like the crooked man. 

Imagine my surprise when my mom walks in with the doctor and asks me when the last time I “took a crap” was. I tried to recall and realized that I in fact could not remember. It was at that point the doctor informed me that I was absolutely filled with stool. 

The next few days were spent with me trying to drop a deuce after drinking a cup of water mixed with powdered laxative. 

To add to it, the more matter I defecated, the more relaxed the muscle became the straighter my body, so I was on a personal mission to push like my life depended on it. 

Edit from the toilet: It’s kinda wild how many people have said they’ve had a similar or the same problem. We all need to fix our diets. 

To clarify, what proooobably did it was me eating Mini Wheats cereal every morning for breakfast, a single Nutella to go every lunch, and then whatever my mother made for dinner which tends to be high in protein, medium in carbs, and little fiber.
