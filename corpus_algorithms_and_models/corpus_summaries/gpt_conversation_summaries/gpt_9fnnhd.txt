The whole political atmosphere is toxic though. As I said, the entire political atmosphere is toxic as fuck these days. I dont really give a shit about what people want to do with their lives. Not sure why other people care so much. Earlier I was talking about how its toxic on both sides. That's why I brought up that point. I can still point out that both the right and the left are obnoxious these days. Politics is a WWE match these days. It's annoying as hell. There is no decency on either side. Every citizen should exercise the activity of calling out bullshit on every side. I would say that unhealthy obsesion with other people's sexual life style is more of a concern than a girl that wants to be a dude. I hate people for their innate stupidity. I agree its overkill, grow the fuck up and deal with the problems.
