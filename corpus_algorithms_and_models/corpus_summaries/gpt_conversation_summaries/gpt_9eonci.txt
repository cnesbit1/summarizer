Even in the past few months the internet censorship has began to completely purge whole swarths of information that I once thought I was somehow enlightened by having the chance to learn. You must seek truth in spite of the lies. When the worlds seems at its worst is exactly the time when people need to fight for the common good. Truth will be brought to the light, forever and always. With all that being said, I want this post to serve as a jumping-off point for truth. What posts/videos/links/theories from this sub keeps you searching everyday for the truth? Dig into your saved archives and share anything below! Keep searching... Gloria Steinem was CIA and feminism was used to put a wedge in the family while at the same time drive down wages destroying the union movement with the addition of so many millions of workers. Feminism is the cause of much of the hardships of our common era. High divorce rates, stagnant wages, single parent statics for grades are very bad, and many other problems associated with broken families. One man could at one time support a family of ten off of one wage. My grandfather worked for the railroad as a switchman and had enough to send three of his children, the ones who wanted to go, to college. And that's in the 1960's. This is now impossible. Inflation and usury coupled with the destructive force of feminism have brought our once great nation to its knees. Freedom is self sufficiency.
