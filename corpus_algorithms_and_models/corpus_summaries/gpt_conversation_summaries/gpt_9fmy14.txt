It triggers them to change sex bc some species of frogs are able to do that.  
No, the rest became infertile. None of them "turned gay."  
They didnâ€™t have sex at all because their testosterone was gone  
You mean asexual? Gay means they are attracted to the same gender.  
Gay = enaging in sex acts with the same gender of your species.  
If it turned them gay they would exclusively have sex with other male frogs but avoid having sex with female frogs.  
I think you are confused about what gayness is.  
And the ones that did try to reproduce, tried to reproduce with the infertile new trans-female frogs that were still male by chromosomes.
