Own up to it  
Nah you'll probably look dumb. Only way out is through brother  
Would it be better to talk with your grandma or a female relative? Edit: maybe mention you’re a fucking girl.  
Yes the stereotypical porn addict is definitely male, so no surprise there.  
Or you could just not assume that she’s a guy. There was literally nothing in the post to indicate otherwise.  
I guess guys just aren’t used to hearing something like this from a girl.  
Happened to me the other day during a pre shower fap. Wife yelled in- turn down the music! I closed my phone utterly horrified.  
Never spoke of it. There is no way she thought it was music.  
Stereotypical doesn't necessarily mean reality  
Quite true. I know many female masturbators, but even myself, when confronted with a genderless chronic masturbator online will default to a male. Biases are weird like that.
