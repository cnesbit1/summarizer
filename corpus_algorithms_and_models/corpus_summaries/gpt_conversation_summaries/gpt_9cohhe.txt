I don't want them accessible to law-abiding gun enthusiasts planning mass shootings or suicide.  
It's not some made up fantasy in my head. One of these gun nuts committed a terrorist attack within earshot of me, a few years ago.  
He was a law abiding gun nut when he got up that morning, not a criminal.  
So he used a rifle, and yet it's a handgun ban you are in favour of. Or maybe all firearms, so only the Police and Military can have them. Yeah, that'll work out well for the populace.  
That's exactly what happened in Quebec City 4 years after. Another law-abiding gun nut brought a shitload of weapons to shoot a mosque. That guy's shitty rifle also jammed, but his trusty handgun let him kill/injure a shitload of innocent people.  
So again, who is at fault? The lunatic hell bent on blood, or a gun? Blaming an object for the actions of a person is foolish, and does not solve anything. We need people control.  
My point is: if a criminal wants to hurt somebody they're going to find an alternative way to do it with or without a gun.  
Vehicles, knives, dogs, poisonings, drugs, Bombs... I mean the list is endless you can use pretty much anything as a weapon to hurt somebody else.  
I hate the 'you're more likely to die from x so don't worry about y' argument but firearm homicides by law abiding gun owners are literally irrelevant, you're talking maybe a dozen a year.
