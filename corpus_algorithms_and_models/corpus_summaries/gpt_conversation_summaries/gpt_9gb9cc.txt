Depends on if he's once again on pace for a 20 goals season and how competitive the market is. Optimistically, a late first, a good prospect (Ã  la Burrows) or a second and a b-prospect.  
A 2nd at the deadline is most likely. Bergevin usually fleeces someone at the deadline though, so maybe we can package him for something good, ala Weise/Fleischmann to Chicago.  
A late first for Byron?  
That's not far off one Erik Karlsson.
