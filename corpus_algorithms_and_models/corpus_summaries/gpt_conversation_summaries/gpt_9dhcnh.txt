In primary 5 there was this guy who would pee in a weird way. He would pull his pants down to his knee, and then not hold his dick with his hand, instead he would just put both hands on his hips and kind of thrust his pelvis toward the urinal so that he was closer. 

So me and other boys would make fun of him by pretending to do that pose he did. He then told our teacher what we did, and what exactly we were making fun of. This was a female teacher, and he was telling her how he stands when he pees and how we are mean for making fun of that. Luckily she just told all of us involved not to talk to one another, and no action was taken. 

Was in sec 4 and got told on by other students for holding hands with bf at the mrt in uniform. Dunman High students sure are a bunch of prudes -.- also got some old uncle shouted at me at the mrt for doing the same thing lol. 

River valley high, same thing for us! We get taught that relationships are so bad, but not given any reason why; and when we leave the school system, this 6 years of indoctrination causes the mindset to become so ingrained in us that we don't know how to go about relationshiping ): 

Ah the ol' Mrs Look talk. If you're in a relationship they'll either force you two to break up or they'll ask one of you to leave the school. 

Also can confirm what she said didn't change much. Every year still got a lot of "secret" couples. Most teachers knew about it but as long as no PDA and their grades weren't affected they didn't condemn it.
