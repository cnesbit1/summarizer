Cool concept. Bad execution.  
Well I certainly enjoy that style (and other examples of it) but I wish the “bagged bike” could be made more practical.  
Edit: I think a less exaggerated length, improved riding position (like look where the shifter is), fenders that allow for hitting a bump.  
Wouldn’t the fact that it has like 1mm ground clearance cause a lot of problems if you tried to go anywhere  
I think you'll find its probably got air bags that inflate and raise the ride up to something useable.  
The seat looks like crap even if it supposed to be a "rat" bike.  
come on, that wheelbase is ridiculous. it takes two people to to park it  and no one is taking that on any incline. its a show only bike.  
point is, it's a show bike that is barely ridable but somehow people are being brigaded in this thread for pointing it out.  
Nobody disagreeing with you that its a show bike, and probably handles like shit. But you could still cruise around on it, regardless of how impractical it is, or if the type of riding you can do it on it doesn't meet your criteria of what 'ridable' is.
