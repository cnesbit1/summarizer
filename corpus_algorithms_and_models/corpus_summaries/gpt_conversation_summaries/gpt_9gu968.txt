It's there [as a preservative.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-thimerosal-color-office.pdf) Thiomersal (the preservative that contains mercury) is actually a different chemical of the following composition: C9H9HgNaO2S. Mercury is not in vaccinations, a mercury containing compound named thimerosal is in a select few, which acts as an anti-septic/anti-fungal agent. Most mercury has been eliminated from vaccines, except for the flu shot. It serves as a preservative in vaccines. It's not molecular mercury, it's thiomersal. A single atom of mercury in a chemical compound does not have the same damaging interaction with our biology as molecular mercury.  It is an important difference to note.
