There was an allegation that Media Matters paid somewhere north of $2 million for control over /r/politics. To be fair, it was anon posting, so not strong evidence of course, but very believable.  
Anyone who saw the transformation of that sub from Aug to Sept 2016 would know that it was highly plausible. *Something* happened and the sub's been a cesspool ever since.  
I think most people would sell out if the price was right.  
Team HRC paid out a billion to hacks and activists and offshore marketing companies.  
The sub went from being very pro-Bernie for the Dem candidate to the chosen Dem candidate. The place remained very Dem favoring.  
I find it weird youve never heard of the Internet research agency  
I find it weird you seem to only know of orgs that are on one side of the political aisle. Why do you think that is  
Would you like to recommend any sources? Or lol are you denying the internet research agency exists?  
Think back: I remember when Reddit supported Ron Paul. This site is not as drawn down the left/right paradigm as you might think.
