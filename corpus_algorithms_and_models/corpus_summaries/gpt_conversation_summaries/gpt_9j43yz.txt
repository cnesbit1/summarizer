Leafs should have at least one of Sparks, McElhinny or Pickard hitting waivers, might be something to consider  
Cam Ward?  
Yeah he was our capstone free agent signing this summer...

I assure you the hawks sub is. The front office however may not be depending on what they know about Crawford that we don't  
Everytime the Leafs have been in a situation lately where they "have to make a decision" they've found a way to steer clear somehow.  
This one really gets me interested if they do it again somehow.  
I doubt it'd be Sparks, dude had an incredible year in the AHL last year, no?  
Yeah tru.. Having said that though, he's not been so great this preseason, plus he has the least amount of NHL experience. Big Mac had awful numbers before becoming Leafs back up but has shined in the role since, despite not playing a lot. So.. Who knows? Could happen.
