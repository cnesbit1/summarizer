Motorcycling is full of riders who are convinced that they can out-brake an ABS. In ideal conditions maybe some of them can. When taken by surprise, maybe not so many, and the consequences of underperforming can be catastrophic.

My guess is that under sufficient pressure, even a pro would fall without the ABS safety net. It would also be useful to see honest results of comparative braking distance, so that the perceived* merits of non-ABS could be fairly weighed against the drawbacks.

But if you're going to ride your bike on the street, where there may be unexpected patches of dirt, surprise poor environmental conditions, lots of cars and pedestrians suddenly doing stupid and unexpected things? That's another matter entirely.

As you said, maybe a *really* great rider can out-brake my 2018's ABS. Maybe even in surprise emergency situations - though I *highly* doubt it. But while I'm a competent, very experienced rider, I have no illusions - I'm not special in any way. I've been in enough emergency situations (and accidents, over the years) to know that Shit Happens, and sometimes you just don't react perfectly, even if you react well.

While I'd buy another bike without ABS for sure (and indeed, I'd buy a very classic bike with drum brakes even!) in terms of everyday street bike? The bike I ride to work every single day in traffic? It'll have ABS from now on, no doubt whatsoever.

What is there to test? You can't lock up your tires, that's a good thing (most of the time) especially if you dislike crashing your bike.
