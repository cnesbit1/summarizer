The fact that politicians are bought for paltry sums of money, between 2-10k dollars sometimes made me think these people were at least talented negotiators. Those ones probably are more convincing but remember this is a Monsanto guy. They are offering much larger sums to politicians than Just 10’s of thousands. Politicians are supposed to be dfenders of the public. Instead they are corporate whores. Congressmen are also immune from insider trading laws. Lobbyists know this. Sure they might give a few grand to re-election campaign but knowledge of an upcoming product, acquisition or merger is far more valuable. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think they finally made this change. People in congress aren’t allowed to trade on insider info anymore. I stand corrected, you are right. They apparently changed the law. However, they also made it very difficult to see if anyone has broken it. There is basically one database where the information is kept, it relies upon self reporting and to search it you must know exactly what you are looking for. So while the law is now tougher, it is also very difficult to hold people accountable for offenses. I completely agree. The law that was passed was just for the optics of it all. Doesn’t mean politicians aren’t still doing dirty shit and getting away with it.
