Ford did this when he started the River Rouge plant. Step off the line for any reason and fired. Foreman could not let anyone off the line and was there to basically scream and terrify the men. He had his own spy service, spying on his workers, keeping track of who was cheating on their wife, who drank booze. He paid $5 per day (a lot at the time) and thought this made him their ‘daddy’. If you didn’t go to church on Sunday, you could be fired. There's this persistent myth among American workers that Ford "gave us" things like the eight hour workday and vacation time and stuff like that, to "keep his skilled workers," and that this pressured other industries to do the same. This is false. Nothing we hold now was ever "given" to us, not even for the most skilled workman. All laborers are replaceable. We have generations of workers who literally fought and died to win the rights we have today.
