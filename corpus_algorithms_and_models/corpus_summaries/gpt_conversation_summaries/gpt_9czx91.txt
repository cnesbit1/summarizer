My gf(21) and I(M25) have been together for 3 1/2 years and our sex life has always been pretty great. Recently though, I've started to notice that things that used to be quite common (and I enjoyed) no longer occur. If I ask for these things, I get an eyeroll or "The more you ask, the less I want to do it" (I ask maybe once a week). I'm starting to go back and forth between felling resentful or sad that this might mean that I'm not as attractive to her anymore ( I've expressed this to her; she denied it). I love her a billion and I don't like feeling either of those things. Have any of you dealt with something like this before? How did you handle it? To put it simply, foreplay for women happens outside the bedroom. Take some stress off her shoulders by taking care of household cleaning type things and learn to date her again. Love on her without sex being involved. The little things matter the most. Then wait for her sex drive to rebound back. It usually happens. If her brain is FILLED with responsibilities, list of chores and groceries, bills to pay, work, etc where in hell do you want sex to fit in?! Seriously both you and her should read this book called  « Come as you are », helped many couples out there to better understand a women sexually. I read it with my BF, he understood and changed a few things. When it comes to what is on a woman’s mind, EVERYTHING is related. Our brains don’t compartmentalize things like a man’s does. If OP's partner wants to do something, she'll do it. If she doesn't, she probably won't. If OP is being useless around the house, then sure it adds a burden. Otherwise, she may be going through a funk. If a woman feels like she’s mothering a man, she’s not going to want to fuck him plain and simple. It’s not sexy being around a guy who can’t take care of himself and when OP says “I’ve been trying to do more around the house” it tells me that he’s not meeting the mark and based on the way majority of women think and admit to thinking, it probably plays a big role. This doesn’t always work. Sometimes as the guy takes on a more pampering, chore-doing role, he gets taken for granted even more. I think communicating directly is the best option as per usual.
