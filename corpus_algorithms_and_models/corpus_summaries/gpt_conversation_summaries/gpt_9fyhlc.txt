I agree with the Senator: *Complete change* exactly what is needed. Change every single thing.

Anything less than complete change is unacceptable.

This is very discouraging. Nancy Pelosi is one of the most respected members of congress, and some users here are speaking of her here as if she is basically incapable of helping with ideas to reform the Catholic Church.

To be clear about this and my statement. There are of course Bishops who also would qualify for public excommunication, in large part because of this scandal.

While I agree with you that the Pope's statement is not good and very tone deaf it's also right. This scandal will lead to many people leaving the source of God's grace.

Edit: I'm also not resistant to change but not all changes are equal. I would evaluate each proposed change before giving an opinion.

I mean plenty are not just excommunicated but also defrocked. We don't know which ones if at all are formally excommunicated. 

Which is why I say bring back public excommunications. I'm sure there would be some Bishops on that list.
