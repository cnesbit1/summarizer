Burnouts are so obnoxious...and pointless. And it’s a sport bike doing a burnout? Cruiser move. ...and I don’t even know what to make of the bride wearing boots holding the front tire? And in the beautiful backdrop of the woods. Such a waste of photographer’s time....there’s probably a pickup truck and illegitimate kid in a tux there somewhere too.....Should probably just keep this shit on Facebook where people give their fake opinions. Yea... Why does a wedding photo need a motorcycle? Like, leave it at home for the day. Cause that's what they wanted. Don't like it? Don't look at it. Motorcycle? That's fine. Burnout? It's your bike, I suppose... Nope, happily married and I still have my bike. I just have enough brains to know you keep the bike and the dog and the guitar at home on my Wedding day because I’m not 12 years old. I know, because if I was the lesser man, I'd be doing the same. I don't because I know better than to spoil the fun of the photo. I'll keep my cringe on the inside, and be happy for the new couple like any sensible person ought to. Besides which, the longer one looks, the more pleasant the picture becomes. First impressions aren't always worth sharing. I mean it's one thing to dislike the photo, I personally don't. But now you're going on some rant about illegitimate kids and pick ups? c'mon... Don't want people to comment on your retarded wedding photo? Don't post it on a public forum asking for comments. Why not? Maybe they both love motorcycles. This was probably taken on a wedding photo day, not the actual wedding day. Many couples get dressed up and go take a bunch of wedding photos on another day, because there's no time on the wedding day itself. But really, does it matter? Why does Reddit hate people having fun wrong so much?
