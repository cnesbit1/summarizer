My main concern is giving it too much throttle and high-siding on a corner exit.  
50% because I don't want to total the bike and 50% because I don't want to total my body.  
If you are worried about the bike you should pick up a cheap bike and make it a track bike.  
And any TD org with the money you give it will have you out on that first day, in some controlled structure.  
If you're worried about messing up the 600, pick up a cheapie to ride the crap out of.  
If you ride within your limits, have proper tire pressures and listen to instructors there's no reason you should expect to crash. Also, I wouldn't expect to be taking corners at 100 during your first track day. Take it easy and learn the basics.  
The reason to go 300 on a track is to save money/learn quicker cause the slower pace gives you more time to think and correct mistakes. Donâ€™t worry about losing the rear. The front is gonna wash out on you before the rear will most likely.  
Rules of Track Riding:  
1) Don't track a bike you aren't afraid to lose. Buy a cheap secondary if you want to track but are afraid to lose your main.  
2) Injuries on tracks tend to be less severe than on public roads. This is because you're forced to wear a full set of race-level gear and there few things to actually collide with. Most track incidents are relatively benign slides.
