There’s things to know here.

Jesperi is from Pori.  
I am from Rauma and support the archrival of their town and team.  

Also yeah to other users not aware of Liiga, this is kind of like Caps-Pens or Fin-Swe situation, maybe even more heated, if that's the correct word for it.  

Since Jepu &amp; Armia are from Pori, I think I'm maybe obligated to hate you now... or something.  

Haha true, se could really use some help in center, also yeah always good to see young guys make IT, especially those who are from your city.  

Also really excited for Kakko, i think he has a really good change to be first Finnish player picked no1.  

Apparently, Google Translate doesn't want me to say "Fuck you, you Rauma scum" in Finnish.  

Google translate is already really bad for Finnish but insults are usually something it doesn't handle very well with any language.  

Apparently it thinks that Rauma means scum.  

*Looks outside*  

Well, that’s not entirely wrong.  
Yeah! Smell you, you Rauma!
