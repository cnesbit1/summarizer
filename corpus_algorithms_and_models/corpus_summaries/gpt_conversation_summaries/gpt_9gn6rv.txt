The problem with this fan base is that they fail to identify the fact that the team straight up over-achieved in the 2017 playoff run. The problem with this fan base is we hate an owner and GM that peddle hope and doing "everything they can" to make us a playoff team, when in reality the owner will not spend to compete properly. A true rebuild would be centered around Karlsson, Duchene and Stone. We've lost the best player we've ever had and potentially have two more stars out the door. The Sens rebuild should have started with a new owner and worked it's way down from there. The fact it started with Karlsson means it started by tripping and broke a leg during the fall. Fans want him to at least acknowledge mistakes. In this interview Dorian tried to spin every single thing the organization has done as a positive. Even ignoring the Karlsson situation, the Duchene trade was an objective failure which deprived a rebuilding team of an almost certain top 5 pick. Yet Dorianâ€™s only mention of it was as part of a story praising Melnyk for giving the ok for the trade. The reason the sens suck now is because *they don't have any of those players anymore*, and because Craig is probably too old to be effective, and there looks to be a pretty good chance the sens are going to look even worse after next offseason when Duchene and Stone have a chance to walk as well. There has never been a worse management team in the NHL than what we're seeing from the Melnyk-Doiron Connection. this is unprecedented.
