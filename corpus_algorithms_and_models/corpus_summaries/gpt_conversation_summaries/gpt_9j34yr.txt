Anything wrong with simply telling them once and then letting them live their life as they want to?  
No, lol.  Your church teaches that all who go to purgatory are bound for heaven.  Purgatory is for their purification, not to "see how they do."  
The catholic teaching is that those in purgatory are going to heaven. Purgatory is essentially heaven's waiting room - if you make it to purgatory, then you are guaranteed to be going to Heaven. Purgatory is for cleansing your soul of remaining effects of repented sin before you enter Heaven.  
That's not how purgatory works.
