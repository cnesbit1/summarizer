Actually, just pick a depth player on the 2016-2017 Avs and chances are you are right.  
Remember when Colborne scored a hat trick in his first game with you guys and hype was real? Good times.  
Tbh I dont think he would be able to de-throne Gelinas. That guy was brutal.  
I do and while I didn’t think it was a Byron repeat I also didn’t think he was so terrible he’d be out of the league already. Was pretty surprised just how bad he was with the Avs.  
Martinsen wasn’t that bad, that being said I’d take Sven andrigetto over him every day  
3 goals in his first game. And then 1 goal for the rest of the season. 2.5 million well spent.  
Except Peter Worrell is the real answer.  
His only upside was this goal: https://youtu.be/BfhlkeNpAj4  
His Beard was fucking awesome though.  
Fedor had a solid career as a reliable NHLer.  He was just on his last legs when Colorado chose to acquire him
