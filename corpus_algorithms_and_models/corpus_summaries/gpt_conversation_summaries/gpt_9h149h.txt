Walkability is something that's important to a stadium.  There has to be activity around the stadium for fans to do before and after games.  A few stadiums have excellent walkability, while others are terrible.  I'll analyze each stadium using Google Maps, as I haven't been to many of these places, and I'd appreciate input from you guys about other things from each stadium that add to the walkability of a stadium.

* HONDA CENTER (ANAHEIM):  The area around Ponda seems a little low-key.  There's several microbreweries and restaurants, but they seem to be more towards the baseball stadium or on the other side of the river.  Walkability seems a little limited in this regard, especially since there's a train station directly serving the stadium.

* GILA RIVER ARENA (ARIZONA):  Okay, this stadium gets a lot of shit for how remote it is, but it has an entertainment plaza with lots of activity right in front of the stadium, similar to LA Live.  Is this plaza any fun?  It looks like fun on gamedays.

* TD GARDEN (BOSTON):  I'm not familiar with Boston, but the stadium is surrounded by highway ramps.  That being said, there seems to be a lot of action directly outside the stadium.  Great for some quality gameday grub.  It's all close together too in concentric avenues in a triangle-shaped block.  Really spiffy.

* KEYBANK CENTER (BUFFALO):  Parking lots, a casino, a couple restaurants, and a huge marina.  Oh, and there's a minor league ballpark.  I don't know much about Buffalo, but there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of action.  Maybe there's more than what's being presented?

* SADDLEDOME (CALGARY):  Served directly by rail, the Saddledome appears to be a part of the Stampede fairgrounds complex.  But the Stampede is after hockey season, so aside from the museum and some country-western bars, what's there to do come gametime?

* PNC ARENA (CAROLINA):  .......I'm not seeing anything.  There's a college football stadium, a high school football field, a large horse stable, and a tiny bistro.  Help me out here.  This looks really really sad.

* UNITED CENTER (CHICAGO):  The action seems to be several blocks away in Greektown.  This part of Chicago doesn't really have the best
