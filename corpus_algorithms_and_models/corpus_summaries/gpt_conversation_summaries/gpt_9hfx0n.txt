Went to Sim Lim Square to try the famous salted egg yolk chicken rice today and it blew my mind!!  
It's in Sim Lim but I think it's level 2!! Not basement! ðŸ˜Š  
That's my fav salted egg chicken too!!! Had it all the time when I was interning near there  
Thereâ€™s one at jiayuen eating house in Paya Lebar. It sells a slightly difference version that translates to salted egg yolk cream chicken  
Name of that place is Taste Good. Cai png starts at around 10am and salted egg starts at 12pm. So go there for lunch. Open on weekends.  
Oooh the shop on level 2 that's closer to the sex shop sells good salted egg yolk chicken rice too.  
Used to order it to camp (during NS days) and it was a real treat. Went back a few months ago, quality has dropped significantly with a marked increase in price; paid almost $10 for a plate topped with cereal.  
There are two stalls at level 2 try both!
