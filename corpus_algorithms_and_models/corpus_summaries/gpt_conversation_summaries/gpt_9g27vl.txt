She just dashed out.  
Shit happened way too fast. It looked like she timed it to run out in front of him. Stupid. Hope she's ok and learned her lesson  
It's infinitely more likely this is just an accident and she didn't see the biker, it happens all the time.  
There's a LOT going on to look at and look out for. Even an observant rider just has to look at the wrong hazard at the wrong time to miss another hazard in this sort of situation.
