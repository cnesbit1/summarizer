Yes actually this is one of the good things about owning a Royal Enfield that you can customize it how you prefer!
The motorcycle I do believe is made in India. There are US dealers though.
They are sold in US also. Look for royal enfield US
I own a Royal Enfield.  I was asking about the rims.
FWIW I considered getting one myself because I like smaller bikes and the price is pretty good - then all the reviews weren't very forgiving so... yeah.
If you don't baby an RE, you will get rust sooner.
RE sells a lot of third party rims here. Don't own an RE, but almost 80% of my riding mates here own REs. Solid motorcycles.
