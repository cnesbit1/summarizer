They didn't tally up any person who died in the aftermath of the hurricane, they tallied up people who died preventable deaths that weren't prevented. The real conspiracy here is why the original death tolls only included deaths from the actual hurricane, acting as though life carried on as normal in PR starting the day after the hurricane ended. No. The actual number is much more likely to be half that. Average mean estimate of 8 studies is **1776.25**. 6 of 8 the studies have estimates **below 1500**. University of Puerto Rico mean estimate as low as **822**. Only one study had mean estimate of a number as high as 3000 (Harvard) and their lower estimate of their offered range was **793**. Furthermore, the study that [found almost 3000 was pretty poorly conceived.](https://publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/projects/PRstudy/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf). It was always obvious that number was way lower than the actual death toll and would rise dramatically. Their electrical grid was taken out. Whole sections of the island were inaccessible. Their local governments were in disarray because local officials were also victims of the hurricanes and government offices and infrastructure were destroyed. They literally could not have an accurate death from the hurricane itself, let alone its after effects, so early after it hit. The number is mostly likely in the range of 1000-1500 or something like that.
