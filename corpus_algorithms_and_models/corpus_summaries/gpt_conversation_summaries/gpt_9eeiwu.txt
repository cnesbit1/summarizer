We know each other so well and have very similar needs and goals in life. One aspect in particular that had been receiving more attention was dirty talk regarding a threesome (FFM). As it became more and more of a serious discussion we were more aware of the possible consequences. We decided that to avoid any sort of relationship complications between us and the third, we would hire a professional (which is not illegal where we live). We both agreed that it was more important that I chose and that she checked off my boxes. In case the event did not go well, I did not want it to take place in our house. What would take place was the longest most thought out discussion. We typed all this up and handed it to the third before we began to make sure we were all on the same page (literally and figuratively). The threesome itself was very enjoyable. I was surprised at how I felt. Nothing felt bad, nothing felt like a boundary had been crossed. And that’s how we survived a threesome. It’s definitely a risk, and we knew that going in. Above all we wanted a stable relationship on the other side of the event, even if it meant backing out at any point in time. I just wanted to give our exact steps and reasoning because that’s not something we were able to find when looking up “how to have a threesome”.
