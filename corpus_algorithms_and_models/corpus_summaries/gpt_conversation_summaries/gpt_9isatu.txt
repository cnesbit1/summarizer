> I'm more upset about the fact he maintained communications with this stranger long enough to divulge about his past divorce, current relationship, and gave her the idea she could even seduce him in the first place.

From what you said it seems like he wants to be committed? maybe he thought like telling you would be "proof" hes committed but he still verbally flip flops.

Tell him that not cheating is fuckin compulsory for a committed relationship, sorry no gold stars here, and how your felt about him texting this chick. but at the same time, you kind of understand what he was trying to say ( even thought he explained himself in literally the worst way) He needs to understand he has to set boundaries , he can have friends that are girls but like know the difference before the sexting happens.

He also needs a better way to communicate commitment.

Ah now, that brings some new context to things.

So how does that change things? People need an to talk. He told her about his life, this isn't s big deal. This was something that happened outside your relationship and he is allowed to talk about it. His past doesn't disappear once your in a relationship. People need to vent. It go inappropriate and he ended it. This seems like normal behavior.

Honestly, what is wrong with showing appreciation for not doing something shitty? Seems like it's something we should all be appreciative of in our partners. If the problem is that YOU don't feel appreciated, then you should speak to him about it.
