Think of it this way: If you were to put an NHL team back in Quebec, how many new fans are you creating? Essentially none. Adding a team in Quebec City would not grow the fanbase, but simply reassign it. Despite an initially financially strong franchise, a dip in the Canadian dollar would lead to another financially precarious team, similar to the Ottawa Senators.

This is the same reason why you won’t see a new team in Markham or Hamilton, either. A team in Hamilton would in fact be destructive to the Buffalo Sabres, who count on Canadian fans crossing the border to see games.

Nobody is arguing that there would be revenue generated by ticket sales, merchandising, and broadcast rights that would rival the most lucrative teams, but the problem in the long run would be saturation of the market, which would actually cause an inverse reaction in the devaluation of the franchises in the vicinity. So even though these Canadian sites would be strong revenue generators initially, it would be a myopic solution to the league’s larger plans.

The entire point of teams are to make money, and canadian NHL franchises **make money**. The issue is some prick named Jeremy Jacobs pretty much vetos everything to do with canadian markets.

I honestly believe the Seattle team is as sure as anything, it's just when. That creates a new market in a city that has shown that it is one of the most passionate sport fan bases in North America. I think it's clear Seattle wants one, and it's clear the NHL wants one, it's just making it work for everyone involved.

The NHL is willing to go to 34 (and eventually 36) if ownership groups are willing to pony up money.
