Like the Phoenix pay system fiasco the Cons set up the shitball but the Libs carried it over the line.  
Uh Phoenix wasn't implemented until months after the Liberals took office, so no, the Liberals don't get to skate on by just blaming the Cons for that.  
It was in development for years before this.  
No.... It was deployed prior to completion.  
Which is why if it is a broken piece of shit with early warnings (which it was) you don't go ahead and say "yeah let's implement this as planned." Which the Liberals didn't do.  
The Liberals grossly fucked up implementing Phoenix. The Conservatives made the horrendous program.  
Liberals were in office November 2015  
"Feb. 24 (2016): First phase of Phoenix rollout begins, involving 34 federal departments and 120,000 employees"  
Yeah, I see your point: they could have delayed the rollout.  
When I first read about this debacle my first thought was that it probably stemmed from the usual: poor requirements and timelines based on when they *wanted* to release the product, not how long it would take to build and test.  
The Cons should've been more attentive to the scoping of the project, and the Libs should've done more than rubber-stamped the NEB's review.  
"The Liberals" didn't impliment anything, it was an IT service provider.  
How about IBM who went over budget by $180 million and still failed to deliver?  
At least IBM was open about Phoenix not being ready to launch before the government gave the gonahead.
