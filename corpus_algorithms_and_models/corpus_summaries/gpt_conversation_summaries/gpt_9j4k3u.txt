In America, where absolute freedom of speech is the standard, Muslims must have absolute religious liberty. First of all, no right as an absolute. Freedom of speech is curtailed when it becomes slanderous, libel, or presents an imminent danger. Also, Muslims have been in America since its founding. A threat to liberty anywhere is still a threat to liberty everywhere…to paraphrase a quote. No one is saying the US should become more Islamic. We're saying that we should respect everyone's right to practice their religion. These people trying to suppress others rights by claiming Islam isn't a religion are nuts. Yet so is *denying* someone the right to their religion , which is arguably a worse proposition. Just as any other religion in America, Islam would be subject to the secular rule of law that governs the actions of all believers. Of course, for this to work in the first place, we need to have a strong separation of church and state, and a strong demarcation of religious freedom. Freedom of religion must include freedom from it as well. We should not let the religious freedom (or lack thereof) of Islamic nations dictate our own. However, if we erode the power of the secular state in favor of our preferred religions, we can’t really complain when other religions take advantage of this. Generally, fascist nations have a lot more "witch trials" than democracies. Democracies have safeguards against this kind of thing, but if we erode democracy, then the ruling party gets to do whatever it wants.
