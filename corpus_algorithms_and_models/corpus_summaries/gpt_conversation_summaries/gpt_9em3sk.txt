After a sleepless night that I can only chalk up to changing my sleeping schedule for my new job, and also because I wanted to watch Seinfeld more than I wanted to sleep. I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life. I started my new job at a green grocer’s a few days ago. The woman who is training me is 35 weeks pregnant and going on her maternity leave tomorrow. S started talking about how the baby felt kinda odd today, and I’m falling in and out of sleep while standing (about 28 hours awake at this rate) and start craving bacon and eggs. We’re talking about how to cash up and close the store when suddenly S says “oh”, and then she says “oooOOOH”. This lady is in labour. I’m 23, and while I may be a woman myself I have no idea what the fuck to do so I start scrambling for the store owner who shouts “CALL THE AMBULANCE, I’LL CALL HER HUSBAND”. The sudden yelling from the manager, the contraction screams in the background, the bacon and eggs, and the customers witnessing the scene all set off some abominable reaction in my brain and the next thing I know I’m on the ground with the store’s owner leaning over me and instructing an onlooker to call a second ambulance. Eventually I’m released with one of those hospital sandwiches and a prescription to ‘rest up’. UPDATE: Currently on my break, and happy to report that S and her baby are okay! Baby arrived safely, and that’s all of the info I have.
