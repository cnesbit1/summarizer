Isn't this on Facebook? They should already know each other's genders  
No, the icons are slightly different and it would also have a thumbs up option in the lower corner. No clue what app it is though.  
Whisper  
It's whisper  
I just go with the assumption that when the profile picture is more than 1 girl, especially if all of the pictures are more than one girl, it’s the one you least want to meet.  
That must be some kind of unwritten rule, because it is 99% accurate.  
They're hoping for the cheerleader effect where they will appear hotter if they are in the presence of a group of hot people.  
If there are no full body pictures, they're large  
Extra extra large  
You can usually still tell by the face, although the overusage of angle shots from above will hide this, so also watch out for those.  
Super hard to tell sometimes. I found if one picture looked like a slight chance of them a being a tiny bit chubby, they always ended up being morbidly obese.

I think that’s a psychological thing. “Look I associate with beautiful women, therefor I must have value they deem worthy of my company.”  
Not at all, it looks like it's already on Tinder. They want to know if they're a woman so they don't get catfished.  
I think that’s a good rule for everyone. If their main profile picture isn’t just them, probably something wrong.

I've explained them all that, showed them all the shit Facebook is up to and that Whatsapp and Instragram ARE Facebook and they just don't give a shit.  
You have no idea how damaging Facebook actually is, even more so for people who are already dealing with anxiety, depression and a variety of other issues.  
I don't have a problem with Reddit. I know no one here, I don't care to know anyone here, I don't know or care how anyone is doing, don't give a crap if they disappear or change accounts.  
Comparing Reddit with Facebook is possibly something Reddit wants, especially now they are trying to push social platform features on us, but they are about as far removed as you
