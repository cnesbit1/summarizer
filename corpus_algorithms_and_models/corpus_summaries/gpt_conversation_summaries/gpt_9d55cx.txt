Lack of evidence is what leads to conspiracy theories. They were identified months ago, it's just being publicised now. Also you can see the guys in cctv leaving the plane from Russia, travelling across London, going to the Skripals home, then leaving the country. Because they're not trying to convince you. Suspects left the country long before identified so what's the value in letting the opposition know that you know who they are. This is the problem that CSI created. People expect investigations to happen quickly and for evidence to just fall into place. They also want to know all the details and see all the evidence. That rarely happens and, quite frankly, none of us have a legitimate reason to see the evidence. We're just nosy. Well part of this story was war posturing with Russia. And of course the unproven russia business loomed over it. So you have allegation after allegation against russia over 2-3 years, all unproven and then all of a sudden they were twisting this story to seem like russia launched a chemical/bio attack on UK. Let's look at it another way. We have pretty much the entire developed world, and their collective intelligence agencies, saying that Russia is being a dirty player. They all agree that Russia is causing a lot of problems. Russia is denying it and accusing all of the other countries of making everything up. Which is more plausible? no, I mean that none of it is proven. As in, the intelligence reports that are the basis for all of the russia nonsense literally contain disclaimers saying they're not to be taken as fact, could be wrong, etc etc.
