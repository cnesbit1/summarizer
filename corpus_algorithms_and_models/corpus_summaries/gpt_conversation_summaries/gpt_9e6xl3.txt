No one? Nah, someone will. It won't be me though. Won't pay more to a corrupt government monopoly when I can get it cheaper on the black market and still have shatter included in my order. Id rather support independent local growers than big corporate douchebags who need to use government to strong arm us.

We wanted liberty, not government monopolies.

You're missing the point entirely. The government sets the prices, decides the suppliers and who is allowed to distribute, leaving plenty of doors open for corruption.

The taxes aren't the issue, the monopolization of the industry by the government is the issue. Again, you confuse monopolies with taxation.

There is no guarantee for good growers or distributors to be allowed to compete, nor can they compete as the government sets the prices, I seriously don't understand how you fail to grasp this concept. It'd be as if the government decided who was allowed to sell Pepsi and made everyone sell it for the same price and then imposed purchasing limits. That's not a free nor is it a fair market.

Supply control on milk is robbing the average Canadian for the benefit of wealthy dairy farmers and their respective corporate cartel.

Not sure why advocating for more freedom in the market for the benefit of all Canadians would ever be a bad thing regardless.

The government sets the prices as the government controls the sale, supply and distribution. 

Government monopolies are immoral and doomed to be defied. Keep up.
