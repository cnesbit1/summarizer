For example. Everyone knows we are a "resourceless" nation. But to fully understand and comprehend the costs and danger of that is something that barely anyone begins to think about.

I have heard many suggestions for a more relaxed work environment where the work is only from 10 to 5, blanket bans on all immigrants whether they are helpful or not, social security for everyone, lower taxes, increased freedom of speech, etc. All the while failing to understand we are treading on thin ice.

It's not that I am not for some of those policies, but the lack of explanation on how to implement them is the issue. People are just backseat driving the government.

As such the only policy I would agree with you on is that blanket bans on immigration is a *very* bad idea.

Then we get to social security vs lower taxes. This is one or the other, really. Personally I'm on the side of social security.

So now going back to my two initial points: what are Singapore's greatest assets? I think it's in education.

I think we can afford to implement policies that cost money and policies that will change the direction of Singapore, because we can't afford not to.

I think this is necessary because it sets the stage for our further development in the 21st century, because we as a population are getting jaded earlier, exhausted sooner, and more mentally troubled.

This I agree with. One of the solutions the government actually is trying to implement is the Flexible Work Award.
