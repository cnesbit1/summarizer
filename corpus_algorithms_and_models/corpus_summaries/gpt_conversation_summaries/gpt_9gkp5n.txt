Let's be clear about a few things. This isn't new data. She came forward 6 years ago. She also stated that she was in fear for her life. For years, she has had to live with that. The psychological damage that can cause alone is a lifelong problem.

Stop excusing rapists and sexual assault perpetrators.

People ARE arguing such actions are excusable.

And you find someone guilty (or not) by investigating, collecting what evidence there is, and then making a judgement. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" is the measure for US juries, one doesn't have to prove it that completely in other contexts (like the court of public opinion). Arguably a higher standard, and therefore a lower burden of proof, would be called for before appointing someone to a lifetime position as a judge on the US Supreme Court.

There IS evidence. Her testimony is evidence. Is there more evidence? We don't KNOW yet.

If this is true, I'm sure they'll say so and it will be a short blip in the confirmation process. Meanwhile, I'll wait for them to say so.

Look, I don't know whether this is true. You don't either. It's significant, its timing is suspicious though explainable, I am saying it should be investigated.

A statement by a witness IS evidence.

She disclosed to her therapist years ago and the therapist has since verified that.

“Innocent til proven guilty” is for criminal trials, not SCOTUS confirmation hearings.

A 'not guilty' verdict does not mean the allegation is 'proven false'. What an entirely naive and simplistic understanding of the justice system.

It means there wasn't enough evidence to prove behind reasonable doubt. That means the crime could very well have taken place - there just wasn't enough to prosecute. Just as a 'guilty' verdict doesn't necessarily mean the crime happened - it's much rarer due the bar for proof being so high, but innocent people can and do get guilty convictions based on the available evidence.

This is a lifetime appointment of a very select 9 people out of 325 million. Your whole life is on trial, including when you were 17. We already have a sexual assaulter on the court, don’t need a second.
