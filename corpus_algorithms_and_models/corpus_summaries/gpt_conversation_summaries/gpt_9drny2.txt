This is true, and most people don't realize it lol.

To be clear though, this isn't about retirement homes, it's about community living and keeping seniors out of retirement homes.

Well as someone else commented some old folks' homes are more like prisons than dorms, but in the nicer ones...ask anyone who's ever worked in one (or anyone who works in an ER or clinic) there is a LOT of hooking up going on.

Seniors are *way* less prudish than most people assume.

Yes. Old People Sex. Its best not think about it.

Oh yeah, my wife works in a nursing home and everyone knows about Welcome Wagon Wanda who greats all the new incoming gentlemen.

Also to add to previous replies, probably 99% of the senior women can't get pregnant anymore so the use of contraception is not quite the same priority as in younger folks so now you have more outbreaks of STIs than any college campus.

And they're careless about it too. Lots of STDs to go around.
