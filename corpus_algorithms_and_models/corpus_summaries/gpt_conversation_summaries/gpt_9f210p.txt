If you smell super fishy, it could be bacterial vaginosis. This is common. Even if you aren’t sexually active. Sometimes new detergents, soaps and even an impending period can change the ecology of your vagina and cause an overgrowth of bacteria. 

Easy fix is to use boric acid suppositories. Insert them in your vagina, preferably at night, as they do dissolve and will cause a bit of discharge. Wear a thin panty liner the following day to avoid ruining your underwear. Most importantly, DO NOT INGEST THEM. They are poison. 

Watery, thin, whitish or grayish discharge is another sign of BV, btw. But the big sign is a strong fishy smell. Normally, vaginas have a musky, salty scent. They should never smell fishy. 

If you are virgin a bacterial vaginosis is less likely. Smell of your vagina is very probably normal and discharge too, so using boric acid would not be beneficial. Women wore skirts and underskirts and no panties in past... Now they have to use pantyliners. Submit your question to r/AskWomen or r/TwoXChromosomes and search those subreddits for "vagina smell". 

The only proper medical advice to a post like this is, "Go to an OGBYN." 

WAIT, Op!!!!

BEFORE YOU BUY ANYTHING TO INSERT INTO YOUR VAGINA, see a doctor first! 

Again, if you’re concerned about the smell, see your doctor. You can even go to your family doctor for this. Simply call and say you need an appointment because you’re worried you may have a vaginal infection and you’re worried that the smell is off.
