We should be honest and open about what is sin, for sure. The truth is the truth and we should never sugar coat it but treating someone who is still living in that sin in a hateful way is so evil of a way to be. Jesus would tell them that yes, they saw the sin of homosexuality but in their own hearts they have already committed a multitude of sins by how they treated this person. They did not show this person the love and forgiveness of God. They have passed judgement on that person, elevating themselves above them in their mind. They may even hate this person rather than having any compassion for them at all. They have spread gossip and hateful talk about them and possibly even convinced others into treating them the same, especially if those gossiping were in a position of leadership in the church. And most importantly, they have probably turned this person away from God. This person may never come to know Christ because instead of seeing him in his servants they saw nothing but hate. If we want to love God, we must love our brothers and sisters here on earth as well. Representing Jesus here on earth to everyone we meet, that is who we are supposed to be. If people come to know Christ, first through his servants and then through prayer to him on their own, they will eventually want to stop their sin in their own because they know He truly loves them and that his way is right. Our job is not to judge others it is to show them Christ in us so they will want to have him themselves.
