Women going back to work within weeks of having a baby Students crushed with debt for usual certificates

There was very little student debt until people decided it was the governments job to give them money for college. Then prices skyrocketed.

Your history is a little wonky. 30 years ago we had almost free and affordable college because govt was subsidizing the schools. Then the banks said why donâ€™t we just loan students the money instead and the govt can stop the subsidies.

I am referring to the same thing. They transferred the cost from the community to the individual.

Especially necessities such as rent(especially in places where you can save money by not having a car), healthy food and medical care, while distractions such as electronic gadgets and junk food are cheap.

And watch as increasingly performing life's necessities while poor are criminalized.
