How much porn do you watch? If any, stop  
When you stop watching porn (well I watched a lot of porn and this is about me and others who watched a lot of porn) your dick feels completely lifeless.... No erections nothing.... Just keep going - don't give in and watch porn to check your dick works.... It does it just needs a break..... all of a sudden you start waking up with erections like a teenager again.....  
I recently stopped watching porn and stopped masturbating after doing it up to 3-5 times a day (on days when I'm off work and bored around the house, also on rare occasions would I go above 3 times) and I totally get the "completely lifeless" feeling.  
How long does the flatline usually last? I stopped fapping a month or so ago and my dick still feels lifeless for the most part. On the bright side, porn doesn't really interest me anymore.  
Average is about two weeks.... The more you watched the longer it takes... It passes though
