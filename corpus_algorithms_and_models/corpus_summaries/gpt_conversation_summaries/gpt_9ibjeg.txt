We missed the greatest production of the modern era because of Crosby's concussions. HE PUT UP 159 IN 99 GAMES BETWEEN 2010 and 2013. That's a 132 point pace whether you take his first 82 games or his last 82 games out of that 99 game stretch. We were going to see the beast seasons of this generation and they don't exist. If Crosby had never had concussion issue I can't even imagine where his points would be right now. He missed most of the prime years of his career. I mean he was on pace for 136 points in 2007 at the 41 game mark and he scored 120. I mean honestly they kind of have a point. The if the greatest players of all time Lemieux, Crosby and Orr have all lost at least 150 games of their prime due to serious injury. Okay I agree. But he was also on pace 3 years in a row for 130 points between 2010 and 2013. Either way, if the absolute worst we were going to get from him is 120 points, we are still missing out.
