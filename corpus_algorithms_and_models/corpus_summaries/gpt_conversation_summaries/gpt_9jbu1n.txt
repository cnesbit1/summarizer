Thanks man! Nexx xr2 carbon I believe. Great helmet, super lightweight, slightly noisy though!  
I think it’s pretty well built, not compared to an arai etc but I’m very happy with it and as I’ve had it for a few years I’m considering buying another  
All joking aside, you _really_ should wear earplugs. Even ignoring the hearing loss, it results in less fatigue, better focus, and honestly it's easier to hear the engine.  
I find that I'm able to hear the engine of my bike and other vehicles better with earplugs.  
It’s is noisy, not unbearably, but definitely noticeable when travelling over 60mph. However that is the only bad thing I can say about it  
I can't ride my bike for more than 10 minutes on the street before my right ear on the exhaust side kills, especially during downshifts. I can't imagine no ear protection on the track. So much more comfortable and no need to worry about tinnitus/permanent ear damage. Earplugs 24/7 even for short trips.  
I use them all the time as well, I actually cannot hear my Sena in helmet bluetooth speakers on the interstate unless I'm wearing ear plugs. It cuts all the wind noise out and all I hear is music and my engine.  
Research shows if you cut out one sense (hearing, vision, smell, etc.) the other senses become more acute and it is easier to focus.  
Maybe you know this already but you shouldn't be "mashing them in" all willy nilly, the correct technique with foam earplugs is to roll/squish them into a long sknniy shape, stick it into your ear, and let the foam expand.
