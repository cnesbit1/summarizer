The experiment was very important for Ontario and the tax payers of Ontario. If weâ€™ll done the knowledge would help us understand how to best spend those dollars (maybe less of them actually) to get maximum impact, and at the same time have everyone be better off for it. Knowledge is power. 

That is just complete nonsense. The only way to know if this is even possible in Canada is by running the experiment in Canada. 

Canceling this experiment will harm Canadians letting it continue would not. 

The benefit of having a working program of universal basic income is one of efficiency: rather than paying into running multiple different programs - social assistance (welfare), employment insurance, disability, old age pension (CPP), etc - you replace it with a single program. 

Let's ask the more meaningful question: what is gained by cancelling this program? 

We haven't gained any useful data thanks to Ford's meddling - even if it were to be reinstated this second, the problems Ford has caused have contaminated the results. 

We've lost millions of dollars for no useful data with more to be lost in legal battles. These costs will likely outstrip the cost of running the experiment rather quickly. 

In short this was a stupid, incompetent move by an unqualified moron. 

It has potential negative AND positive impacts for Canadians. Shutting it down could have huge negative impacts... no doubt the courts will be consumed with this mess and it will end up potentially costing more than the program itself.
