It's a really good example of how racism can occupy our brains, and use us to teach racism to others, all while we genuinely believe ourselves immune. 

when people are racist, they know they're racist. and it looks pretty intentional to me. 

I wish. Lordy, do I wish. Yes, some do. But so, so many people manage to delude themselves into thinking they are not. 

Unconscious bias affects **everyone**, and the only way to stop it is diligent awareness. 

You would be surprised what levels of "I'm not a racist" people can come up with. 

I can't see myself losing so much awareness that I could make this. 

These people didn't think of themselves as racist, but their racism was constantly on display.
