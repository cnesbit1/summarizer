Eventually, this group of three women sat down by me and asked if everything was ok. It happened so quickly that I didnâ€™t get a chance to thank you ladies for helping me and showing me compassion when I felt so alone. Thank you. I stopped and got out of my car. I talked calmly as I approached her and stopped about 10 feet away to avoid frightening her. I asked if she needed any help or if there was anyone I could call for her. I offered her my cell so she could call on her own, but as I moved closer and extended my hand, I could see my movement terrified her. She declined the offer and started repeating, "Go away. Go away." I immediately went to campus security because I know they are trained to respond to this kind of situation and they did respond immediately. I felt so useless. I know there was little else I could have done in the situation. Honestly what you did was great. Maybe return with campus security. I'm sorry, thank you for showing empathy. I think what you did was fine. If she had been assaulted she might have done that to any man that approached her, even a police officer or medic. You did great helping her out and I'm sure she is appreciative of it, even if she was too rattled to tell you. The college is in a small town with a part time police force and none immediately available after midnight. About a month later, I received a visit from the sheriff's office to get my statement as they were pursuing criminal assault charges.
