Why? they are gods people too they are just blinded by god himself to bring salvation to the world, until the great tribulation. there will be a remnant that come to Christ . Read Romans 11

Edit. Look up something on jesus in the Old Testament. Check out behold Israel on you tube he has sermons on this and Jesus in the feasts. They missed the first coming, don’t understand what the messiah is for and what he is and are waiting for a world leader who will end up being the antichrist they will reject him when he claims to be god and then they will turn to jesus.

That’s not to say you shouldn’t try to tell them about Jesus. but they already know all the stories . And they have to come to it on their own. They don’t like being preached to. Also Isaiah is a good one to prove jesus.

“What then? What the people of Israel sought so earnestly they did not obtain. The elect among them did, but the others were hardened, as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭11:7-8‬ ‭NIV‬‬ http://bible.com/111/rom.11.7-8.

Read all of Romans 11. It explains everything

“I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: Israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the Gentiles has come in, and in this way all Israel will be saved. As it is written: “The deliverer will come from Zion; he will turn godlessness away from Jacob.” ‭‭Romans‬ ‭11:25-26‬ ‭NIV‬‬ http://bible.com/111/rom.11.25-26.niv

Israel is blinded until the end of the gentile times. The gentile times are now up until the great tribulation. Jesus will bring his people to him in the end and there will be a grafted olive tree with cultivated (Jews ) wild (gentiles) to the root (jesus)

Jesus is god in the flesh . He’s who Adam and Eve walked with in the garden he was the light and word at the beginning of the world he’s the part of god that is the visible manifestation of god in the
