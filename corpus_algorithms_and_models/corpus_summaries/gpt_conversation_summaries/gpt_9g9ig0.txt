I won't wash my hair after 10pm when everyone has gone into their rooms because it's too close to 12 am and if I close my eyes, Bloody Mary will come out of the mirror and get me hahaha. I absolutely love horror movies and Halloween, all things spooky, but can’t do the real life freaky shit cause my mind tricks me into thinking it’s real. I am terrified of baths for an equally silly reason. I'm afraid of getting electrocuted with a toaster. There is an episode of Psych that has a girl die because someone drops a toaster in her bathtub through a window and electrocuted her. Now, even with a bathtub with no windows and a door closed and lock, I still find baths very scary. I feel too vulnerable. Showers are fine though. You're not alone!! I'm more afraid a serial killer is going to break through the door though, I listen to too many murder podcasts and watch too many crime shows haha Funny because I love horror movies too! But usually a very scary movie makes me scared for over a week. I used to shower whit candles as my only light before. But after I saw a really scary program about Bloody Mary I can’t do it anymore. I hang blankets over mirrors and stuff if I need to sleep in the same room as them. I also grew up in an apt that was shower only, so I didnt take a lot of baths growing up so that could also have something to do with it.
