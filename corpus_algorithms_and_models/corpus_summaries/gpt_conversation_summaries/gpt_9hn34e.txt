I’m a Christian guy in my early 20s. I know I’ll always have the Lord, but I do fear growing old alone. I really want a Christian girl to share my life with, but I have a big problem. I hate sex. It seems embarrassing and gross and dirty. My big dilemma is that, like I said, I do want a girl to share my life with. I want to be a normal Christian husband/wife in every way minus sex. I mean why couldn’t we just hug instead? I’m a single child and have very few friends, none close. Even as a Christian, the thought of life alone is scary. I picture myself a depressed and lonely bitter old man living in a dirty little rundown shack all alone! Seriously, I do. I know it seems unusual. I think it might be because I’m shy and lack confidence. It is possible that you are asexual. And it is completely fine. Asexual does not mean that there is no sex drive at all. It means that person is not that interested in sex IRL. Are you sure you are asexual and do not have another problem. You need to unpack this nit sure you need a label but if it was me I would seek therapy well before getting into a relationship.
