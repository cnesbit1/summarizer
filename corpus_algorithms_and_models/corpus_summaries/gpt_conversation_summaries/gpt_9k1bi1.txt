At best, a Socratic method is a great, incisive way of cutting away problematic thinking and getting to the heart of the truth. It has integrity and it’s useful. That is not what’s going on here. These folks are not above pretending to be Christians to trick people here into engaging. They’re not above using their ‘method’ on those who are openly in crisis and are here seeking support. A quick glance at a questioner’s post history will often tell you everything you need to know.

Faith is one of those things that is understood and experienced from within. It isn’t an of-this-world thing, so it can’t be persuasively expressed as an of-this-world answer to an of-this-world question (Why do you believe? What evidence do you have? Why your God and not some other? Etc etc.) That’s okay. The reason it’s difficult to give a persuasive answer is because it’s an irrelevant question.

A lived relationship with God is a complex, nuanced, ever-growing, ever-developing thing. That makes it hard to sum up in a persuasive and pithy nutshell. That is the strength and complexity of your faith, not its weakness.

You’re not letting God or your fellow Christian down by preferring not to engage, when to engage would be to encourage someone in a hobby aimed at humiliating other people. It is actually not a pastime any decent person should support.

I couldn’t find one video with a smart/educated Christian. 

Makes me wonder if they didn’t post any of the smarter conversations or if the smarter ones aren’t in public. 

If I was wanting to prove a point I would use the worst interviews to make the other side look bad.
