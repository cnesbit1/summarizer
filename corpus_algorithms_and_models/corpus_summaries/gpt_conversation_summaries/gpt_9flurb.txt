Valium is an anti anxiety med. It’s a Benzo, not a painkiller. 

Diazepam is used to treat anxiety, alcohol withdrawal, and seizures. It is also used to relieve muscle spasms and to provide sedation before medical procedures. This medication works by calming the brain and nerves. Diazepam belongs to a class of drugs known as benzodiazepines. 

It can be used as a muscle relaxer, but that’s not the same as a painkiller. The fact that you all argue things you don’t actually understand is infuriating.

Agreed. It's more like a mild tranquilliser, so if muscle spasms are causing pain, then yes they will help the muscle relax a little, which would, as a consequence, lessen the pain. But it is not a "painkiller". It's also like a sedative, so you feel more loose. 

Agreed we have not used proper terms. However to the average Joe, having back pain and being prescribed valium to relieve this will equate to it being a pain killer as it makes the pain go away. When in reality it is a muscle relaxant which reduces muscular pain. 

Yeah, it fixes the cause of the pain, rather than dulling the pain as an opioid would. 

To be fair to the doctor and the pharmacist, it probably wasn’t actually prescribed for pain. In this situation is was almost certainly just prescribed as an anti anxiety med.
