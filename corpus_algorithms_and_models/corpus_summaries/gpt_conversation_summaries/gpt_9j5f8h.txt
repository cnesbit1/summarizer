The problem itself lies in me completely losing interest in gay sex the moment I cum. like it's baffling it's so instantaneous. I don't feel disgust per say, I just lose interest and I feel like I'd straight up walk out on someone if that happened to me during sex. 

This is not all that uncommon. I mean what you describe here is pretty extreme--but it's not really all that uncommon for something to go from sexy to meh after orgasming. 

Haha, thats interesting. But regarding the sex drive kill after the orgasm, I know what you're describing here, I get that with women in smaller doses. I'm not nearly as attracted after sex, but definitely still attracted even if my penis doesn't really get me at that point. With gay sex it's like from 100 to complete 0. just nothing. It couldn't be less sexual, it doesnt evoke any feelings.

So in a way for me gay sex is more about playfulness and less about pure attraction--and once I'm done, the playfulness leaves the building, and there's very little left.

I'd say that's how I am 100%, but one experience kind of changed it. not thoroughly though, I was more attracted to how things went and the atmosphere, the mood, the situation all that and less to the actual person himself, since I know next to nothing about him other than that I like how he looks and that we can barely communicate since he speaks broken english.
