I'm pretty sure this is the third time I've seen PK do this now.  
fuck he does it every game  
Takes quite a bit of strength and technique to single-arm body punch a 200 pound guy into the ground.  
This was hardly a punch and happens multiple times every game. Speaking of emotion, you got your mad out of your system?  
He hit Mack out of fucking no where. I went ballistic. I cannot stand shit like this  
You think this is dirty?  
It isn’t Todd Bertuzzi level scum but it’s sure up there  
How? He fucking hits him in the chest. You gonna put flags on the guys next and say no contact? There's literally nothing wrong with this hit  
Doesnt take a rocket scientist to recognize a cheap shot mi amigo. Might be in the chest but it’s unwarranted and unnecessary.  This is a consistent thing for PK, this isn’t an outlier  
Considering we're still in preseason it's pretty unnecessary.
