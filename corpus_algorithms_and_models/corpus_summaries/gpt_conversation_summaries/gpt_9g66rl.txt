You couldn't find 2 more different bikes to compare. Do you want an upright bike you can mess around with on all kinds of terrain, or street only? A fun hooligan bike, or a track day weapon? What kind of riding are you interested in? Is it your first bike? If so, DRZ all the way. 

I'm still a new rider so something thats slow and more in town kind of riding is what I plan to do. 

An R6 is one of the worst possible around town bikes. Out of sport bikes, it, and the R1, are probably the most aggressive. They are track weapons, much more so than anything else. 

If you don't want the DRZ (which is a great towner bike) and are set on supersports, check the other brands. The CBR and GSXR are fairly comfortable. Even my '08 zx6r is very comfortable. I've toured long-distance on it. 

Well in my area, that would be a much more expensive bike. The SM models usually command more of a premium than the S model. 

DrS you forgot to tell him/her how much of a hoot supermotos are in general! You can have so much fun with them w/o having to worry about launching yourself to the stratosphere if you sneeze. 

Really I am thinking of supermotoing the hell out of mine in a year or two. 

I really think OP canâ€™t go wrong getting that SM as a first bike, unless he deals with frequent altitude changes and other things that might make the carb a hassle. 

Definitely don't recommend going out on your own too extremely. Did that once...haha nothing quite like getting lost in the woods for a few hours and wondering if you'll run out of gas.
