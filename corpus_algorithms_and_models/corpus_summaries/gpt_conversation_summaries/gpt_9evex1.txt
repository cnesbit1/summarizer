Living in SF, I run into a lot of characters. Tonight, a kid (20), came up to me and called me beautiful. A woman about my age came on the train, and noticed my predicament. Kathleen, thank you. You made me feel safer for 20 minutes when no one else did anything. Calling them out might get me a fellow man hit in the face. Id prefer to go the fake friend route but I wouldnt want to make the girl uncomfortable or end up being another creepy stranger dude. How would I passively insert myself here is my question I suppose. “All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.” A.Lincoln Talk to him - divert the conversation perhaps, sometimes all it takes is them knowing that someone else is paying attention. It’s intimidating to confront someone you’re stuck in a tiny space with for who knows how long, because like you said, it can escalate so quickly and this person is unpredictable. You want a white knight. Gottcha.... Ill give it a shot next time Im worried a girl is uncomfortable. It totally would. I would welcome any intervention and trust my gut about the person trying to help. In this case, the dude was talking about his expensive clothes, so butt into the conversation and ask him where he got x item. "Dude! I need to know where you got that shirt!" Just keep his attention, ask him what bars he'd been to, keep him talking and if you can, get him turned away from his original target. The fear of violence stops a lot of women as well - I’ve seen videos of women being bystanders, telling men to do something, and then continuing to be bystanders when the men refuse. It’s sending the message that men are supposed to engage in violence, which is ridiculous because nobody is supposed to engage in violence. If you’re worried about your safety by saying something, imagine how we feel. I was in a very similar situation more recently although I will say the guy bothering me in this case was more run of the mill drunk than straight up predator. Kathy did a great job shielding OP without escalating or insinuating anything. Where and when did they say only men should? All persons, whatever gender, should look out for each other. Sometimes it's not about teaching them a lesson, but just getting through the day. And bring up stories like this to other men. Morality tales help. If you see anyone, man or woman in an uncomfortable situation, you should do what you can
