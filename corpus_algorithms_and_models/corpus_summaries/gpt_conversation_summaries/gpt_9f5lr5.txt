What a fucking asshole thing to say. And OBVIOUSLY I would never do that as Jews (Catholics, Blacks, etc) are not represented by this asshole. He is just some pomp'ed up figurehead who is a total dick. He does not represent Jews, and Jews don't swear to him.

But holy fuck the "Jew Privilege" of this guy to downplay everyone else's pain, and yet again, declare himself the "biggest victim" in the room.

The subtext is not even subtle.

Maybe they should stop shooting innocent people in the head, stealing their land, and destroying their thousand year old olive trees. You are trying so hard to paint a sympathetic Israel. The truth of the matter, and the disparity of death and weaponry and the permanent state of fear endured by the Palestinians is finally coming to light.

I don't think anyone is anti-Israel. They are anti-zionist. Which is exactly what Bibi is. He is a fucking Zionist and he gives Jews a bad name. Huge difference.

Wtf? This isn't a translation. He spoke those words to a camera. He's not illiterate, he speaks perfect english.

You don't think anyone is anti-Israel?? Have you been on Reddit for more than one day?

Almost 7 years. Again they are against the Zionist not Israel. Zionist are running Israel so it's hard to separate. I know this is hard for you to understand but just try and I think you can do it

The text is the evidence. The literal point was to “read between the lines”.

I'm predominantly playing devil's adovocate, as I think it's important we reflect upon even our conclusions (otherwise we are as good as those who blindly accept the first explanation).
