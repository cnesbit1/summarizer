I'd buy me a KTM 390 or Enduro. Easy to maintain, high quality, distinct look, best thumpers in the market.  
Honestly I agree. It's beyond me how they can't make a reliable thumper. Every other manufacturing has done it since the 90s.  
When did that start? I've got a 23 year old LC4 in the garage that's been a tank some I bought the thing when it was four years old.  
Right? My RFS motor has been treating me well too. I don't get the hate for KTM's  
All the issues people have with the 690s and 390s  
Google KTM "any model" reliability - you'll have a good read.  
Glad you got one that's not fucked. I had the misfortune of working on several RC8's and a few dozen Superduke 1290's all of which seems to come completely fucked from the factory and KTM were the most difficult company to deal with.  
I had one customer that had a completely fucked from the factory RC8 and KTM didn't validate the warranty at first, then the just said "it's how the customer rides the bike" and that was it.
