Season 10 Ep 8. Asia Argento is in it this episode. A tall man doesn't hang himself on a doorknob. He always said if he went out, it would be by heroin. Weinstein killed him. The day he committed suicide the girl he kept going to bat for whose true friends warned him about was seen cheating on him. Israelis know how to honey trap, ask Vanunu. Either Weinstein or Clinton murdered him, it wasn't a broken heart. Harvey hired Mossad: https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/israeli-operatives-who-aided-harvey-weinstein-collected-information-on-former-obama-administration-officials And we're just supposed to believe he killed himself by hanging due to a broken heart. L O fucking L. Argento dated Harvey publicly after whatever incident happened. She stuck u or pedophile Polanski. Her life is ruined now because of her own actions. Why would Bourdain get killed? It makes no sense. If he was alive she would've embarrassed him and used all his money by now. He was a broken man with a broken heart. He had more integrity than to kill himself over a dumb bitch. How much integrity does it take to pay off the dumb bitches sexual abuse victim? You're admitting that he was completely smitten with a dumb bitch. You're the emotional one. Possibly an incel. You're very upset that a celeb hero of yours who has all kinds of demons was set over the edge by that "dumb bitch".
