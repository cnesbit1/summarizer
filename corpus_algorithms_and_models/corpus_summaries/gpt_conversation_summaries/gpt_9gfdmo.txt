I don’t think political leaders can or should be doubling as moral leaders — my first assumption about humans is that we have a sin nature, and so every politician will surely have his share of that. Policy matters more to me than character precisely because I assume poor character. I believe that Christian religion depends on some sort of political structure for protection, precisely because it’s so pacifist. So, I support minimizing immigration from all parts of the world that don’t share Christian culture. I also had hoped that Trump would pull out of some of the wars for Israel and so far he has been successful in that. It’s easy to take that safety for granted and to assume everyone would reciprocate and be as pacifist as we like to be, and as full of love for outsiders. It's a myth that Democrats want to take all your guns. We just want better regulations and laws that require EVERYONE to do a full background check before being allowed to buy a gun. Countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States. For the record I’m pretty neutral on guns. Never owner one. Never even fired one. I’m pro Medicare for our country. And yeah gun control... seems fine to me. Many people desire stricter controls on guns of all types at the point of sale such as background checks and mandatory gun safety courses.
