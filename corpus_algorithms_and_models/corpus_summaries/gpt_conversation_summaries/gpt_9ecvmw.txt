The concept was cool and the animation was unlike anything on TV. FWIW beast wars and reboot were in large part handled by dan didio, who went on to be the head honcho at dc comics until flashpoint(2002ish-2012). Considered by many to be one of the better eras in all of comics, though there are always some questionable decisions. He’s also one of those who pushed hard for the more adult characterization and serialized format you see start mid s2, and that beast wars had from the start. Dinobot’s sacrifice haunts and inspires me to this day. More formative than the death of Optimus Prime. Netflix has a new series in the Reboot universe. It starts off slow but I have hopes that next season will be better. The new reboot of Reboot isn't bad. It's not as good as the original but it's fun and entertaining. Amazing show. And it really does hold up to rewatches, especially past first season. The first couple episodes are def a bit kiddy but it matures and finds its voice fast. Still rewatch it every few years. The dinobot episode was amazing. I always wondered why it had a different name in Canada, considering the show was Canadian made. He’s still a pretty high executive at DC. I believe he’s co-publisher with Jim Lee, which yeah is above EIC and I assume less hands on. It was also called War Planets. I had all the little toys too. shadow raiders, also awesome but I think it never finished? not sure if it was just cancelled or they made the beast planet too strong and had no idea how to end it lol
