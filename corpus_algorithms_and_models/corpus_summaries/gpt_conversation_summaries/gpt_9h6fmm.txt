Older Goldwings do look so much nicer so theyâ€™re definitely a consideration, I have also considered getting a Gwing and taking the fairings off but that makes the bike so much smaller and takes away a lot of storage which sort of defeats the purpose, basically I want the size and comfort and storage of a Goldwing with the aesthetic of a Norton Commando, Triumph Bonneville, CB750 etc. The new Indians are fairly solid If you want a bike that is more comfortable than a Harley, more reliable, better built, nicer looking out of the box, and is American Made for the same money... buy an Indian. Look at the Scout and Scout Bobber. You can add whatever level of farings or bags you want or don't, they come as 550'ish lbs and 100 bhp, so plenty of giddeeyup. And they are pretty reasonably priced - $12-14k OTD. The whole, "you'll spend more time fixing it than riding it" thing isn't true any longer. It's a reputation that Harley has had a hard time shaking off. Indian's and Harley are both very good bike manufacturer's, neither is quite as reliable as a metric bike. However the difference is minimal anymore. Modern Harleys are not the money pits they used to be. That bad reputation comes from the years when AMF owned the brand and tried to ramp up production faster than quality control could keep up with. AMF sold HD in 1981. You should also watch out for bikes made before 2001 that use Magneti Marelli's EFI system, as those are prone to failure. After 2001 Harley switched to Delphi for their EFI systems.
