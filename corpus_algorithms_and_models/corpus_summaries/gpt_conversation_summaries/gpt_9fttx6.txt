It has zero nutritional value and does not quench thirst.  
There’s a reason a soda comes in like a 40oz cup with unlimited free refills. Try drinking nearly as much water as people consume soda. You’ll be done with your water after the first cup  
All I’m sayin is go to dinner with your friends/coworkers. Watch how much Coca Cola someone can consume in a short period of time in comparison to water. Apparently you’ve never worked inside a resturant. Watch someone order coke, 3-4 refills easily. Water, you’d be lucky to fill their cup more than once.  
Does it taste better since it’s loaded with sugar? Sure, but at the end of the day when I’m extremely thirsty I crave water, as humans should. If you’re craving soda you need electrolytes  
Diet soda is poison.  
Water might not please you but it sustains you.  
Add a small pinch of salt, sugar and lemon juice not for flavour but electrolytes. The drink will be a relief to your body.
