500 miles in I had a low-speed (fortunately) low-side crash that broke the fantasy I was living in. Fortunately, I had basic gear (gloves, boots, helmet) or my left hand would be quite a bit thinner.

So the message I would like new or prospective riders to take from this is, first of all, assume the advice here and everywhere else online applies to EVERYBODY.

You are the biggest threat to your own safety. And the best antidote to over-confidence is constant honest self-assessment.

Good luck. Wear your gear.

Edit: People seem to be taking issue with me admitting I’ve done something reckless, and I’m not going to defend it. It was reckless. The purpose of me bringing it up was to illustrate how your perception of your ability and control can change, particularly in the beginning if you haven’t had an accident.

Speeding is not just a thing that happens. Just because it's easy to do and most everyone does it (super guilty) doesn't mean it isn't completely avoidable with a small amount of discipline.

It’s fun to get the revs up + it’s fun to shift  = speed

I’ve said it every time in this thread, I don’t advocate it and the reason I mentioned it wasn’t to say that this is my daily commuting behavior. It was a moment where I realized I had pushed it too far and I’m hoping I can save someone that lesson by giving them the facts as I’ve seen them.

It doesn't happen unless you let it.

Which exactly the theme of this post.

It’s not “it just happens” it’s “it can happen to you”
