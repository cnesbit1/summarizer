It must be weird right now because the power is a shifting to those who want to do their job but have been prevented from doing it. I'm assuming the leadership is still pretty much controlled but the climate makes it difficult for bad actor to remain discreet. People must be outing themselves left and right. I am specifically speaking of the part of law enforcement that collaborates to hide crimes rather than police them. I would say cops do precisely what cops are created to do. Look into the origin of cops and it's all about protecting industry and private property, not the public. The majority of people feel the same sense of paranoia walking out of a store without having bought anything. While it's a complex problem, the most expeditious solution would be to legalize both all drugs and prostitution. These are the two big areas in which the police mandate is to go after people for consensual activity, and ubiquitous consensual activity at that. Cops don’t work for us, they work for the state. Once you understand that, it makes much more sense. That’s where people are wrong. The Supreme Court has ruled that duty of police is NOT to protect a citizen. They work for the corporation that pays them. Unfortunately you are misled to believe they are there for you. They are there to serve and protect the crown or corporation they work for. Cops have always worked against law-abiding citizens, as designed. They are nothing more than the enforcement arm of a corrupt fascist state, always have been.
