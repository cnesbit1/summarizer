**Here is what will literally drive your girl to the point of gyrating and dripping in your palms: fingering her with your middle finger, palm up, and simply rubbing her G-spot firmly (in pressure) but gently in speed in a CIRCULAR motion**. 

It got to the point where she was screaming into pillows and losing 95% of bodily control. She had no recall of what her body was doing in reaction because the feeling itself was “pure ecstasy” to her, and her limbs were extending and clenching every which way (kind of like we men do when a blow job goes on for “too long”). 

**TLDR — It May sound like remedial school on sex, but there IS not only a “proper” way of fingering a girl, but a way to drive her nuts. Just firmly and smoothly rub her G-spot in a slow, firm circular motion, and let the good times (and her juices) flow**. 

Same. Literally nothing on the inside will make me cum without clit stimulation. I've done a lot of self exploring and found that I just basically don't have much, if any, feeling inside anywhere. 

Well sure techniques vary from person to person, but I know what areas of my own anatomy bring me to orgasm. I have had exactly one vaginal orgasm without clitoral stimulation in 22 years of having sex and even longer for finger banging.
