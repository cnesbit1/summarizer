Last Wednesday I cleared out the freezer. My shitty ex-roommates had left 18 pounds of cheap meat in there, and I was so preoccupied by my thoughts of “who the fuck even does that” that it wasn’t until after it was all in the bottom of the can that it occurred to me that the trash had just come the day before. 

On Friday, I exited the house and was greeted by several dozen flies. Ah. I’ve fucked up. This is immediately apparent to me. Well, it’ll just have to wait until trash day.

Sunday. Raccoons have been in my bagged garbage. I need to take care of that. Hesitantly, I open the can lid. Oooooooh boy. In a split second, I get the immediate impression that there are hundreds of maggots in the can. 

Monday. Otherwise known as today. I gear up. Poison, rubber gloves, eye protecting glasses, a face mask, and a box of moth balls. I can do this. I’m a scientist. I throw open the lid. It had not occurred to me that they might be on the underside of the lid.

There were at LEAST a thousand maggots JUST on the underside of the lid. These rained down everywhere, their hideous bodies plopping onto the ground. I thank my lucky stars none got on me. I screamed like I was being murdered, an entirely involuntary sound wrenched from somewhere deep in my spine. I sprayed. And I sprayed, and I sprayed. I walked around and sprayed the writhing layer of maggots on the underside of the lid. I sprayed at the ground. A fly flew at my face and I gave up, running back inside, sobbing. 

And it’s Labor Day. I called eight different pest control places until I found one that was both open and able to send someone out. I’m currently awaiting my savior, who should be here in a few hours. I’ll update with the cost of him coming out. 

Edit: the bug man came, he was super sweet, really excellent. If anyone in the Round Rock/Austin area needs pest control services, PM me, I’d be very happy to pass his info on. He didn’t charge me, said I reminded him of his daughter, so I gave him the money I had set aside for a tip. 

Also: I threw out the meat because I didn’t know if it was safe or not. I have
