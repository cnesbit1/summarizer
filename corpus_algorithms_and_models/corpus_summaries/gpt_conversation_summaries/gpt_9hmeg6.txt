The reason it isn’t a conspiracy is bc this is a known fact that slaughterhouses/animal factories do this type of thing ergo it isn’t a conspiracy because it doesn’t allude to something bad going on when it is well-known

Well by definition a conspiracy is a secret plan by a group to do something. If the activity is found out or is common knowledge then it stops being secret and gets labeled as something else depending on their action. You can still get charged with conspiracy however as it itself is a crime.

I know what goes on and I know most folks do turn a blind eye to if and crack jokes about bacon and shit. It’s why I went vegan last year in August. I’m just saying it isn’t a conspiracy when it’s well known what goes on in places like this. Only the owners are trying to hide it but most people know what happens anyway

90% of people at fast food places have no idea about the horrific conditions their food comes from. Congrats on becoming a vegan. It is the best thing people can do.

The one thing I think many miss when talking of the moralality of keeping livestock is how they are actually an integral part of sustainable farming practices. Intensive rotational grazing keeps soils healthy, and is the natural state for most lands. Fertilization through composting manure is necessary for healthy productive gardens. Proteins from meat, milk and eggs are what we are designed to thrive off of, so essential some people have huge health complications from their attempts to go vegan. Ironically, those who eat only meat and fat have been shown to be extremely healthy.

Throughout history the largest threat mankind faced was starvation. One of our bigger worries today is an overabundance of foods. This is specifically due to our livestock practices. While livestock and agricultural practices are not perfect, and there are areas of massive need of addressing, the attacks on things like eating meat are just silly.

The fact that we bred them to be more convenient to torture and slaughter doesn't make it okay to do so.

The problem with most of the logic in this thread from the vegans is basically since most meat is raised in these conditions we should abandon the idea of eating meat entirely.

There is a middle ground. We can responsibly and sustainably eat veggies and we can do the same for meat products.

I agree. I’m not against eating meat products, I do it myself. If my comments came off that way that’s my bad. I don’t think everyone should stop eating meat, just stop supporting the companies that keep the
