Everyone deserves a fair trial, the attorney doesn’t have to like the person she’s defending. Most defense attorneys spend their lives defending criminals.  
That doesn't mean he should try to pass off a rapist as an innocent person.  
Being a good lawyer doesn't mean trying to make a guilty person go free.  
The attorney was hired to defend him, did so, got paid. That’s how it works, defense lawyers defend criminals. This doesn’t mean she condones what he did, she was doing her JOB.  
A defendant is innocent until proven guilty, she is trying to defend a presumably innocent man because that is her job. Regardless of how terrible a person is, she must defend him to the best of her ability to ensure a fair trial.  
While I agree that the lawyer's victim blaming is disgusting, our justice system only works if defense attorneys are willing to do whatever they can to defend their clients.  
But she's not trying to present a fair case. She's choosing her words carefully to paint the woman as an intentional seducer -- "fake boobs" is the new "what was she wearing?" I guess -- and the guy as helpless in the face of her aggressive come-ons.  
The point is that's a bullshit victim blaming defense and she didn't have to take the case. "Defending someone as well as possible" vs twisting the truth intentionally.  
It also doesn’t mean she should vilify a victim. What does her ethnicity or her cosmetic surgery have to do with anything? Nothing.  
Victim shaming works. Until it stops working, attorneys are going to keep using it, because if it gives their client a better chance, they would be potentially violating their own duties to their client if they don’t.  
It's her job to give her client the best possible defense. This includes using every dirty trick the law allows.  
I agree. The lawyer is slimy even if she was just doing her job. Good employee. Shady person.  
Being a defense attorney doesn't mean you have to lie and twist reality though. Present a fair case so the judge and juries can decide.  
The point is that you can do your job and defend your client *without* resorting to painting someone else in a racist, sexist light.  
The fact that this year has more female candidates in the history of this country gives me hope.  
This is fucking horrible and disgusting! Seriously? No jail time? He raped her... They're are people rotting in jail for Marijuana possession and this guy just raped
