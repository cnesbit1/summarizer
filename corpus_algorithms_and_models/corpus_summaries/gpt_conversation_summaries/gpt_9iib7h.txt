Being the good boys that we were we promised them we would not invite our friends over. After several days of them being gone, I suddenly realized that they would have no clue if my friends came over while they were on such a remote island. My brother ended up getting a longer shift so in our boredom we decided we wanted to prank him when he got home. I then got the bright idea that not only should we do that, but we should move everything in the house two inches to the left. After one room of this prank, we decided it was lame so I came up with another idea. I told them, "What if we flipped over everything in the house and made it look like the house got broken into so that my brother freaks out when he comes home." I called my brother and told him that I would be staying with some family friends that night so he would have to hold down the fort himself. When my brother got home, he called me and asked me if I had left the garage door open. The moment he saw that he called the police and told them our house was being robbed. I called him and told him it was just a prank. We knew we were hosed when we saw the blue and red lights in front of our driveway. They told us that the guns they were pointing at us were loaded and that if we moved we would be shot. They questioned her for awhile and finally told us that we were the stupidest fucking kids alive and that they never wanted to come back to our house again.
