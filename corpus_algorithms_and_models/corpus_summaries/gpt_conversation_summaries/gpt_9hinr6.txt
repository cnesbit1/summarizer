It all depends on what you consider witchcraft. Wiccan is Witchcraft but it’s also a religion focused on White Magic. The witchcraft your thinking of focuses on Black Magic. Which encompasses putting Curses, and Hexes on people.  
Magic spells of sexual consent vs. magic spells of sexual molestation.  
You know, magic is as real as the people believe. Sometimes societies and the individuals composing them take for granted what they believe. Its, in large majority, magical thinking.  
Extreme would be putting hexes on people and probably some animal sacrifices. Shit like that  
Extreme is like Witches Gone Wild. Regular is Harry Potter, study-hard Hermione style witchcraft  
I say "magic" is simply the means by which will manifests to reality. Whether that's by bartering inherently worthless metal or strips of paper, by written "spelling", or by physical effort it's all magic IMO.  
well if magic would exists we would call it science.  
Black magic is not all curses, any magic you do for gain, power, ect is considered black magic  
I consider WiFi to be magic. Think about it. You can’t see,feel,hear, or smell WiFi but it’s there. And the capabilities of WiFi being able to remotely control objects over vast distances if it’s set up right is very mystical. Magic is the same thing can’t see,feel,hear, or smell magic but it’s there.
