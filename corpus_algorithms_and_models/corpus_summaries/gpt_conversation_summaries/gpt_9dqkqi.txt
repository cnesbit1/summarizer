The literal act of having sex doesn't arouse me[19F] at all. I don't know if I'm just SO desensitized to sex from porn or super intense fantasies but I just don't enjoy sex in the ways that I enjoy masturbation (namely, having a freaking orgasm). I don't think I'm asexual because I do desire sex and experience sexual attraction and have sexual feelings, but I just don't get anything out of it. I have a Mirena IUD. I can orgasm on my own just fine, my nipples aren't particularly desensitized either as 1. I've never had particularly sensitive nipples and 2. I have them pierced so that kinda helped with the minimal sensation issue... I've been on some form of hormonal birth control since I was about 14/15. I only ever felt true arousal once with my first boyfriend when I was younger, so aroused in fact that I almost came from him just playing with my boobs. But I then dated him for a while and that never happened again. Update: the IUD works locally and should have no effect on testosterone. I really haven't even been off of hormonal birth control since I was 14... I guess the timeline fits for me not finding sex all that great? I think about watching other people having sex... I'm never really involved in the fantasy.
