I (F 20s) absolutely love it when my SO (M/20s) licks, sucks, kisses my nipples. It turns me on and gets me wet every single time without miss. It’s so intimate and it’s so hot and it makes me feel wanted and admired. It’s so good that there were a few times that I orgasmed just from that. 

Do you guys have kids? My nipples are definitely my most erogenous zone and i looove having them played with and sucked on. I'm 5 months pregnant and am having a hard time coming to terms with future breast feeding... i mean i dont want to get aroused while feeding my child but i also dont want to lose my boobs as a sexual object (for my man). Just wondering how a mother or couple can compartmentalize that.

It might kill the arousal for a bit. It stopped being an erogenous zone for us one month before and about 9 months after birth.

It doesn't even come into your head, and while you're breastfeeding I doubt you will want your husband/partner to play with them. It's like they become de-sexualised if that's even a word?

Just depends. I breastfed for two years and there was never a problem regarding what you’re talking about. But everyone is different. 

I’m also super sensitive and can orgasm from just nipple stim. I think/hope you’ll be able to successfully separate the two functions.
