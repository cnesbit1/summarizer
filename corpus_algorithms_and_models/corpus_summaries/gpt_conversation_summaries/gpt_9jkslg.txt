The number of people she's had sex with doesn't effect anything.  
Say she only had one partner ever. And they had sex 10 times a week for 1 year . That's 520 times . Now imagine it was 7 different guysover her life . Having sex with them 3 or 4 times, maybe even 1 only once.  You are looking at having sex 28 times max!  Over a lifetime.  It's all relevant. 

Plus your "sex number" is some real high school shit.  If you are kicking a girl out because of a sex number she dodged a bullet  .  
You aren’t entitled to this information, sorry to break that to you. She probably lied because you were the one being immature by insisting you have a right to know how many guys are in her *past*. Myself, I would have just told you to fuck off and definitely would not have slept with you. Poor girl.  
If she lied about something that actually mattered then I would be inclined to agree. I’m assuming here, but I’d be willing to bet you went about asking in a very dickish way as well. 

Whether she lied or not, you have zero right to post information like that about her. That’s fucked up and wrong no matter how you spin it.
