I’ve been saved, baptized, recommitted my life, and prayed countless times for god to save me, but it never felt real. I wanted so badly to feel saved and like God was with me, but it never happened. I don’t think I can ever truly be a Christian now that I’m older. What frustrates me the most is that I can’t express these feelings to my family. I can’t have a civil debate or talk about the way I feel without my mom or dad getting mad at me and starting a fight. Their firm pressure and forcing me to follow their beliefs has only pushed me farther away. I haven’t stepped foot in a church a single time since I moved away from home, and I don’t see myself ever going back. "When a young man who has been going to church in a routine way honestly realises that he does not believe in Christianity and stops going—provided he does it for honesty’s sake and not just to annoy his parents—the spirit of Christ is probably nearer to him then than it ever was before." \- C.S. Lewis Most people need to come to a fuller and more deep understanding on God, and that is usually a very personal and round about process. I forgot about this post while I was at work, but I really like and appreciate your response. I have tried so hard to convey that religion isn’t the number 1 priority in my life right now since I have a lot of other things going on in my life, but that isn’t enough for my family.
