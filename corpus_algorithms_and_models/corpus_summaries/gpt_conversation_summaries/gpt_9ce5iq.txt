*As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. And his disciples asked him, “Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?” Jesus answered, “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.*

My family is this way - it gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to others, that, no matter how bad things get, if you maintain faith, integrity, and compassion, you can still be completely happy and make the world a better place for others.

According to the Christian YouTuber I watched, these are the obvious signs of cursed twins:

1. Hate each other
2. Constantly fight
3. Constantly Disobey their parents
4. Compete with one another 
5. Bring constant misery and pain to their mother 

My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.

My twin sister and I have a very odd, lowly life right now. It almost seems unreal how fast our life turned around...how fast we hit rock bottom. We both struggle with mental issues that makes it hard for us to be normal independent adults.

Just FYI, #1-5 are all things totally within your control - not the stuff of curses, just choices.

The only uneducated opinions you are getting is from YouTube and these people filling your head with this curse nonsense.

All these are things that siblings (and children in general) do... My sister and I meet all of those to the extreme.

Then work on being more loving towards your sister.

This is the most reasonable things you've said here.
