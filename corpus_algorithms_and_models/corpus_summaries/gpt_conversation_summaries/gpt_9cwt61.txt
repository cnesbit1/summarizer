The McCafe near me is pretty impressive. They have an espresso machine and the menu is stock but complete. The prices are on par with McDonald's.

The only reason I still go to Tims is because it's on the right side of the road, it's extremely convenient. McDonalds is on the left side, I'd have to make two lefts at lights, go to McDonalds, and then another left at a light, so it can add 10-15 minutes just navigating traffic.

I’ve never used the Tim’s app so I can’t compare but I’ve had zero issues with my orders with the McD’s app, fwiw.

And strangely enough, whenever those $1 coffees are on, I've had the cashiers actually ask me if I want to save my free one for when it's regular price.

The minute McDonalds decides to go balls deep and open up a couple thousand McCafes, Tim's is done. The only advantage they have left is the number and convenience of their restaurants.

McDonalds has done amazing things. I never would have gone there 10 years ago. It's now nice. Efficient. Quality is good and consistent. And they have plenty options of quality stuff.

At this rate, if McDonalds introduces their own version of Timbits, it's game over for Timmies.

I 100% would take McDonalds coffee or Timmies. The only reason I even get Tim Hortons now is the McDonalds is double the distance away or I’d never go.
