Holding someone down, covering their mouth to “cop a feel” was certainly sexual assault in the 80’s. This statement is absurd  
Context matters, the situation matters. That's it. Party sex is always dangerous. Getting girls intoxicated to take advantage of especially when you're a privileged guy who apparently loves beer in high school. It's just not a good situation to be in.  
I’m not sure where you learned how to “make a move” but in my experience it has not involved forcefully holding a person down and quieting their screams by holding my hand over their mouth and having a friend turn up music.  
I do know what I saw yesterday. I believed her, I did not believe him. I know she welcomes an FBI investigation, the GOP does not.  
You have made some of the most grotesque defense of sexual assault after I confronted you with Trumps own words describing how he sexually assaults women.  
Which is fair. People have different perceptions. Although to argue as you did earlier that the events that she described were not assault is an absolute absurdity.
