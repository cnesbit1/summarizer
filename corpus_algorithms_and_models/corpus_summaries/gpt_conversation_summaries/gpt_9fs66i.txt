Canes lost 2 captains too  
They got demoted to As and Williams is now captain  
Jordan staal and who was the other one?  
Faulk  
My opinion is that Bill Peters's decision to go with co-captains was a wrong answer to a question where there were multiple correct answers.  
The entire debacle didn't make sense and frustrated literally everyone involved.  
Everyone was happy that Williams got it finally, especially Faulk.  
The majority of the fanbase agrees that the situation was bad.
