So scared . N levels start tomorrow.  
Just do your best :) good luck!  
And remember it’s not the end of the world if you don’t do great, even if it seems like it is.  
At this point there’s not much you can do to revise, if you’re ready then you’re ready.  
Just get lots of sleep and drink plenty of water so you’re focused and alert tomorrow.  
Good luck friend. Practice papers and confidence are your greatest weapon.  
Good luck and sleep early!  
good luck for your N levels!! :)  
damn same. at the beginning of the year I was thinking September is a long time from then and now it's just tomorrow. good luck tho.  
good morning all the best you got this!  
I'm also taking N levels tomorrow, good luck to you! Hope we both will be able to do our best  
Had a margarita last night with the history teacher, he’s starting to grow on me.. he’s a pretty good kisser.  
just curious - how do y’all define a *good kisser* like y’all can remember and rank meh??  
this is like plot twist for a lot of romance manga lol. awkward shy nerdy guy has a date with a vibrant cheery talkative girl, then turned to be expert in relationship stuff.  
edit: congrats though hope it goes well! :)
