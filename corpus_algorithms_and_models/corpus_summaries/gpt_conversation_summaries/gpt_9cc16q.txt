It’s a book where the girls a journalist, they meet when she interviews him, they fall in love, he turns out to be a BDSM fanatic. Never read it either but it’s everywhere these days.  
I would argue that it’s not some 50 shades shit because:  
* OP wasn’t stalked or controlled. There was consent and She felt safe.  
* Her writing is a thousand times better than 50 shades  
Dear lord. I expect my life to be less spectacular. It sounds a bit like a cheesy Virginia Andrews young adult novel rip off.  
Thank you my dear! We filmed the whole session so I am pretty sure it didn't happen in my imagination😊  
Alright, alright people. I was just noting the similarities between the journalist meeting the BDSM fanatic. Didn’t think everyone would take me so literally because I know and I get it. Have a nice day
