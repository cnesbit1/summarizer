Brisbane near the Lady Cilento, isn't it? What was he getting out of his van for there? That's not a great place to stop and those lights change pretty quickly.  
No idea why he was getting out. He disappeared around the back from what I could see in my mirrors  
How was this unsafe practice? Thats a perfectly justified use of lane splitting if it was legal where he is? He wasn’t going fast either since he was able to stop promptly.  
The only unsafe thing I saw here was someone opening their car door in the middle of the road.  
There's a lot of evidence that it's [actually safer.](http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/05/29/motorcycle-lanesplitting-report/) Most countries in the world allow lane splitting without issue. Yet, inexplicably, people in the US just fold their arms claim it's unsafe despite all evidence pointing to the contrary.  
It’s 100% legal in California lol  
he was probs checking the van or load, nothing unusual  
South bank, especially friday and saturday nights / arvos are fucking horrifying on the bike. Were you covering the front brake? If so nice job mate  
I try to get out of work early on Fridays purely because of that traffic lol
