You can bring up lockouts but the league came back stronger after each one.  
You can bring up expansion but hockey registration rates are increasing across the US.  
You can bring up taking advantage of cities for arenas but league franchise values are higher than they've ever been.  
The league is far better than it was when he took over.  
Hockey is a prohibitively expensive sport. Full stop.  
The cost alone of operating a hockey arena versus a field or gym/court pushes the costs up, not to mention more physical equipment than most other sports I can think of.  
I'm fairly certain player salaries and franchise values have outpaced inflation by quite a bit over the past 25 years.  
There are more hockey fans and participants than there were 25 years ago and I'm fairly certain those numbers outpace general population growth in most areas.  
Staying on topic: Bettman isn't responsible for the state of hockey or what equipment manufacturers do. He's responsible solely to the NHL and its owners.  
The issue is the gear has become more expensive because of two reasons: fools and their money, and puck speed.  
The goalies have to wear this gear because any player over 100lbs/40kg with a midtier+ stick can shoot the puck 70+ MPH.  
Bettman has the ability to regulate rebound strength of sticks, overall durability of said product and force Goalies and equipment manufacturers to reduce the size and hard plates in their gear, like shoulder pads and elbow pads in the NHL.
