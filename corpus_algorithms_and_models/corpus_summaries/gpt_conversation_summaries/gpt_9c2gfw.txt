The difference is that one is backed by pounds of glands and fat, the other typically lie much flatter.  
That wasn't the issue, the issue in the above comment was nipples visible through a shirt. And the other issue is that while women are told to make nipples not visible men are not because men's nipples are not sexualised by society. Women are legally allowed to go topless in public, they are legally allowed to breastfeed anywhere, but the manager was afraid that if drunk clients saw nipples through a shirt the client would behave inappropriately. Why should an employee have to wear a garment under their uniform in order to convince clients to behave in an appropriate manner?  
Funny thing about legality, you can't just pick and choose when to apply it. The only way such a dress code would be legal (and in this case it seems from the article that there wasn't a written down dress code in place) is if all employees (male and female) were required to wear either a bra or undershirt as a necessary part of their job. Nipples get erect for all kinds of involuntary reasons. Preventing drunk patrons from behaving inappropriately (which was the reason given) does not seem to me a necessary function of a uniform.  
that's the point. They don't want all their co-workers and customers spending the entire day being averting their eyes.  
Iâ€™m okay with this. Make it a blanket rule. Really when working with potential of get your work shirt dirty from some idiot who thinks it funny to throw something at you. I recommended that all servers/ bar staff wear something underneath so that they can switch shirts in the middle of a shift if they need to.  
Yes I am. There use to be a time when boys and men were expected to wear undershirts. So as a business just expect everyone on staff management included wear some sort of undershirt. This would maintain equality for both genders, would not isolate transgender individuals, and would create one rule that everyone must follow.
