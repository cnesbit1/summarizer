Enforcement by Change.org: If we are put on notice that your campaign or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it is defamatory or violates privacy, intellectual property or publicity rights or others, or is funding an illegal activity), if we discover that your campaign or content violates our Community Guidelines, or if we believe your campaign or content is inappropriate or objectionable, we may remove it from our platforms , or we may make edits to bring your content into compliance. In the vast majority of cases, we will notify you and try to work with you to fix the issue before we take any of these actions (but we are not obligated to do so).

Under their community guidelines:
No hate speech – We’re fans of free speech, but we don’t allow hate speech. Hate speech is typically the advocacy of beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people based on characteristics such as their age, colour, disability, ethnic origin, gender identity, nationality, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, medical condition, or veteran status.

If we follow this logic then slavery would still be legal today.

Slaves asking for their freedom ≠ hate speech.

Basically, you're advocating a law which would penalize the minority by curtailing their freedom (with potentially 2 years of imprisonment).

They are merely asking for reprive from this gullotine hanging over their heads.

It is true that police don’t go around enforcing it. But with this law in place it makes it feel as if being queer is wrong when it’s perfectly alright to love whoever you wanna love. It’s just one step towards being accepted and having equality.

And if the law isn’t being enforced alrdy, why keep it? Removing the law won’t force straight ppl to be gay.

No, you want LGBT people to be second-class citizens. That is reprehensible. Wanting to be treated as an equal human being is not an attack on your rights. Your rights do not supersede everyone else's.
