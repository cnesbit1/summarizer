I rode back from Law School, around 10:30pm. I was riding in the middle lane of a 3 lane highway, doing the speed limit. Almost out of nowhere, I notice this guy in a truck is speeding in the right lane. He proceeds to slow down, matches my speed, and tosses his cigarette out the window at me (went right by my face, but didn't hit me). He then proceeded to cut me off in the middle lane, and speed away. I’m a fairly new rider, and I just wanted to thank you for all of the previous posts about staying calm in these situations, and to not let anger allow you to do anything stupid. Just know it’s never worth it, and always be the better person! Ride safe out there! EDIT: Wow, I did not know people throwing stuff at riders happens so much. Thanks for those who share their stories/ gave constructive input! If you have any stories to share, I'd love to read them. This helped blow some steam off... I like to stay in the center when I can possibly be seen better. If you think that the fact of someone being in the middle lane constitutes something getting thrown at them on a motorcycle, you're a fucking asshole. Never said that. Yup the dude was in the wrong for throwing something at you. I hate when people throw their cigarette out even when it’s not aimed at me.
