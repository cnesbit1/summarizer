It was so much more popular and expensive than 8 last year. Apple might have saw the opportunity that people are still willing to pay a high price for iPhone. I like apple but even i feel this new pricing for 512Gb is abit crazy. And the Iphone Xr being their “budget” phone , starting at 1249. You can't put the words, apple and budget, together like ever. The Iphone X only came in the 64gb variant and 256gb variant and personally, 64gb is way too little for me, especially with no external storage to increase it. But there is cloud storage now but even with Apple’s 50Gb icloud backup, i kinda ran out of space already. So i would rather have more on board storage This is what irritates me the most, it's USD$749, which amounts to SGD$9xx - but they are charging us SGD$300 more! But alas, I will wait for iOS12 and see what improvements it does for my 4 year old 6 plus! feels like it'd brick it though. Heard from alot of friends with older phones that once they upgrade the iOS the phones get sluggish cause the hardware can't really improve the software.
