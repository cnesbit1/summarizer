Porn is cheap substitute for a real thing (relationship) and if I can't get the real  thing my way I reach for a substitute. I'm a passionate computer  programmer who's not willing to waste time by going out and try to get  women to like me. I don't expect you to understand. I'm just tired of waiting for the right lady I could give my affection to. One thing to consider is that the women in those porn videos might not be there voluntarily. They could be supporting drug habits, the victims of an abusive boyfriend, sex trafficking victims, etc. I found the right lady. It's worth the time, effort, and the wait!! Thank you for not judging me harshly. I've been single for 6 years now. I do admit my attitude is here to blame I just really dislike wasting my time. I used to be a computer programmer and I was just like you! I had a number of projects I was working on and I would sometimes go all day and all night. It can be addicting! And don't you think maybe a little unhealthy? Maybe a woman could help you round out your life? Not trying to push you or anything... just a suggestion! I absolutely agree ! Woman may improve my life. In several areas, perhaps. I've been asking God to get her banging on my front door shouting "I'm the lady you've been waiting for !".  So I don't have to waste my time going into public events and things other people indulge in just to meet her.
