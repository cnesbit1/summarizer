As far as I’m aware, yes. Trump isn’t allowed to drop the deal so he must continue to negotiate, but we aren’t obligated to sign anything unless we want to. We can hold out for as long as we want.  
The CPC has stated straight up they would just do as they are told (by Trump). Trudeau has stated that Canada he will fight get a fair deal. Personally I believe both groups.
