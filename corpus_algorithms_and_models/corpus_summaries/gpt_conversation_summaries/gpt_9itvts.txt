Duchene will get shit from management for sure. We will now trade him for peanuts to "clean the locker room".  
Exactly. This is a brilliant move by Duchene: he wants out, so he gives them a perfect excuse.  
This way he may not even have to wait for the deadline, because Melnyk/Dorion can just say he was 'a problem' in order to justify even the most lopsided trade.  
They've already made it known that they'd rather trade good players than pay them.  
I wouldn’t be surprised if Dutchy asked for a trade TBH. He doesn’t want to be stuck in a rebuild like we were in the past and wanted to play Playoff Hockey. No fucking way he’ll resign with Ottawa.  
Never thought Duchene would turn into a mercenary but it sure is looking like it.  
This isn't a team  
It's a god damn arms race (to the bottom).  
They're just trying to get the highest possible second rounder.  
To be fair to Dorion, he didn't say it was a *good* team.
