But just what those 'Mad Max' supporters want to see from this new party on immigration policy appears to vary wildly from person to person. And where Bernier chooses to draw that line could have major consequences for him, his new party and the broader political landscape in Canada.

Bernier may not be a racist or have racist policies, but he's attracting racists, bigots, and white nationalists. They're going to ruin whatever efforts he makes to make Canada better or give conservatives another/better choice. Which is already happening and it's hardly been a month since he broke ranks to create his own party, happening on the Facebook page:

Late Thursday night, a posting on Bernier's B.C. Facebook group revealed the challenges he may face in attracting supporters he doesn't necessarily want.

One account whose avatar featured an old Norse symbol known as the valknut, often associated with white supremacists, posted a "Make Canada Great Again" meme with a picture of Bernier. The same account also posted a screengrab of some of Bernier's tweets about "the cult of diversity" and added the comment "Yes Mr Bernier this cult must be destroyed."

"Already fake accounts are popping up covered in hate symbols," said another. "If this group isn't banning racists flashing swaztikas and Valknuts, this is over before it has started. CBC will eat Bernier [alive]. Ban this idiots Admins before they ruin any shot."

He will announce the party today. Hopefully he's got enough metal to correctly give conservative Canadians another choice on election day while ensuring that hateful shits have no voice on his platform.
