Marriage looks more and more to be an extremely one sided transaction with all benefits to the woman and none for the man.  
Does the word “~~alimony~~ maintenance” sound familiar to you?  
&gt;the standard of living enjoyed by the family before the breakdown of the marriage  
You are legally obliged to financially maintain your wife. Section 69(1) of the Women’s Charter.  
Marriage has always been about men securing sole sexual access from a woman at a cost to him. Now that the cost is ever increasing while access shrinks, see the contract become unappealing to men and discarded.  
When you make the provision of sex optional but the provision of maintenance mandatory, you skew the balance of the contract. Men who are aware of it will see that it might end up becoming a sexless trap where they keep paying the woman for free. Women will always press for marriage because security and lifetime payments.  
Now most men are unaware of these gems hidden in the women’s charter and they marry for true love hahaha.  
If you ever become rich, you will be targeted by 30s women looking to settle down and have kids. Money &gt; looks for them by then. If that happens, I hope you remember what you’ve learnt about the women’s charter from this thread today. Will make my efforts and negative karma worth it.  
The men have to pay to maintain their wives during marriage not just after. The men will have to do it whether they like it or not. While the law will no longer mandate that wives have to provide sex to their husbands whether the wives want it or not.
