God's law is eternally binding. "The law," that is, the Mosaic system, is what was done away with; but the principles are still here.

For instance, the ten commandments define and condemn all manner of sin. They still define sin today. The Mosaic system teaches us that the wages of sin is death, and that in order for the transgressor to live, a substitute must die in his place. It is still the same today, except we do not need the Mosaic system to teach us this. We may look back upon the Mosaic system, as well as the fulfillment in Christ, to see what our sins have done. This is to cause us to abhor sin and turn from it. But how can we know what to turn from? By the law of God, particularly as described in the ten commandments.

So then, the rituals, the ceremonies, the earthly temple; it is all done away with as a foreshadowing of the work of Christ. The lessons taught therein are not. Sin is still sin. Atonement is still needed for sin. Sin must be cleansed and done away with. And sin is defined by the ten commandments.

The Hebrew word used for "covet" in the commandment, much like the plain understanding of "covet", has the implication of a desire that is either strong and/or with potential will to acquire. But the commandment doesn't refer to coveting in general. It specifies things that should not be coveted: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” (Exodus 20:17 NASB)

Coveting your neighbours house involves a failure to love your neighbour. It fails to appreciate your neighbours good as equal to your own

Covetousness is selfishness. It is the root of every evil there is, and the very antithesis of the kingdom of God.
