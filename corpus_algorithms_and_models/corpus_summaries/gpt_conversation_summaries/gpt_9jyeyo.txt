Recently the son of a family friend committed suicide (gunshot). It was unexpected for those of us who did not know he struggled with depression. Once I got to the funeral home, there was quite a line. I stood and waited in line to see the family and to pay my final respects. Once I got home, I realized my mistake when I took off my hat. The hat I always wear. Smith &amp; Wesson branded logo. I feel like such an asshole. It was completely unintentional but man do I feel like such a jerk :( Rest easy up there bud. TL;DR wore a Smith &amp; Wesson branded hat to the viewing of a man who committed suicide by gunshot. Yes, OP shouldn't have worn a hat to a viewing, but not because it was indoors... You generally don't wear a hat in a formal setting. Informal settings, hats are perfectly fine indoors. I agree with you I'm really not arguing that you're wrong, I just don't think the family should really care about a hat on someone at a funeral. They're grieving, they most likely did not even notice him in a hat, and if it really did bother them i'm sure they would tell him and he would immediately take the hat off. We live in a world with unimaginable evils happening every day, and we're but a speck of dust in the universe; a hat really shouldn't matter in the end. I understand that it's a simple thing not to wear a hat though.
