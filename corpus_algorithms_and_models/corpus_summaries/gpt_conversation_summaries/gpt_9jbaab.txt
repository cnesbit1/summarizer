Back in 2014, a mass grave was found in Falfurrias, Texas:

They're about a 40 minute drive from each other:

Could just be a coincidence. Maybe.

Even the article you linked mentioned that a funeral home was just burying the bodies of illegal immigrants that were found dead from trekking across the countryside.

Pretty sure the people here are saying that two unrelated things happening 50 miles apart doesnâ€™t really seem to fit the parameters of a coincidence.

Rich old White guys going hunting? 
Immigrants dying less than an hour North from the border.

The graves are explained in your own link.

If I engage in human hunting parties and a mass grave turns up 40 minutes' drive from the ranch, feel free to knock on my door.

You could reason that separation between the grave and the "hunting ground" would be wise from a not-getting-caught standpoint. However, Dick Cheney DID shoot a guy in the face and that wasn't enough, so who knows. Maybe if the grave was on site that would have turned out differently.

The problem is that the association is very specious at best. Essentially the only thing you've got connecting these two disparate things is the distance. It's far more likely that they're unrelated.

7854 miles squared. That's how much area you get if you go from one point to 50 miles away in any direction. To be assumed to be accountable for anything that happens in there is just absurd. Sorry.

Do you even know how big Texas is? 37 miles in Texas is like 37 yards to the rest of the country. Really, come on now.
