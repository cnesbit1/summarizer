Islam doesn't take kindly to conversion. Be safe.  
It doesn’t teach to believe and uphold those books. It teaches to tolerate those who were born into those faiths, but still that they are wrong.  
And it’s not sectarians inventing death penalty for apostasy. The Quran is pretty clear about that. See Quran 3:90, 4:91, 9:11-12.  
An English translation of the Quran - 5:47 And let the people of the Gospel judge with what God has sent down in it. And whoever does not judge with what God has sent down, then these are the wicked.  
An English translation of the Quran - 5:68 Say: "O people of the Book, you are not upon anything until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel and what was sent down to you from your Lord." And for many of them, what was sent down to you from your Lord will only increase them in transgression and rejection. So do not feel sorry for the rejecting people.  
You’re ignoring the fact that death is clearly recommended for those who convert from Islam to another religion.  
Death for apostasy is a command given to Muslims.  
An English translation of the Quran - 2:256 There is no compulsion in the system; the proper way has been clarified from the wrong way. Whoever rejects evil, and believes in God, indeed he has taken grasp of the strongest hold that will never break. God is Hearer, Knower.  
An English translation of the Quran - 109:6 "To you is your system, and to me is mine."  
"Death penalty because you converted to another religion", that's what the sects do. It's not Scriptural.  
Muslim here. Fullsarj is correct! It is mostly a religion of peace, unless people try to drive you from your homes or block the acceptance of monotheism.
