The biggest contributing factors to this are A) boyfriend has a form of ptsd from abuse as a kid, B) I have almost no sex drive, and C) every time I try to feel anything pleasurable, by myself or with him, I start sobbing uncontrollably. I've seen both an obgyn and a therapist about it, and the determination was that there's nothing physically wrong with me, and the only thing mentally is mild depression. I'm a virgin and he's only had sex once, so he doesn't really know what he's doing either. Not happy crying, like child crying, overdramatic TV sobbing crying, and I can't stop it. When I try to at least, yes. It never lasts long enough for me to actually get anywhere before the sobbing starts. It's more confusing than anything else. I've done that, but after 7 years of all sexual encounters being focused on him, I've gotten bored with it. Nothing negative happens when I'm just doing things for him, only when I try to get anything out of it. I can try that next time, Thank you! Maybe try to find your limit. Not all at once but over the course of a couple weeks or something have your BF explore your body in different ways. My point is that you shouldn't just say "I'm gonna fuck him," you obviously can't. Sex is a great big journey there's plenty of stuff you can do before you get penetrated. So explore that, find your limit, the most you can do without crying, and then slowly start to get yourself comfortable with those things.
