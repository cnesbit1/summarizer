I don't wear gear (beside helmet) when I commute to work. It's a half hour trip through heavy traffic. I wear gear if I ride with friends because i push my comfort level then. 

The more reckless or hard you ride the more you increase your chances of something insignificant ruining your day. 

Road awareness and good riding habits go a long way, but it can only do so much. You might be perfectly fine doing this, you might not. 

I personally just think that it's a good idea to learn from other people's mistakes before making them yourself.
