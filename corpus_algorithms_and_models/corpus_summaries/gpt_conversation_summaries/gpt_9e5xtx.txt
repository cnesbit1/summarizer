Non-Canadians shouldn't be getting all the benefits that Canadians have paid into. Even those ones who pay taxes? No. If they want Canadian benefits with the taxes that they pay, let them attain Canadian PR. They're getting way more from Canada than they pay in taxes anyway. They can't just jump a fence and get everything that Canadians get. True globalism doesn't exist. Canadians are starting to turn against immigration. Let's not speed up that process. Whoa, whoa, hold on. Permanent Residents are non-Canadians too. I actually meant them in the first place. You're comparing honest people that went through a formal process to people that entered illegally. Don't move the goalposts please. I don't. You said "non-Canadians", I pointed out that PR's are non-Canadians too, so why you think they shouldn't be eligible even though they pay taxes? The subject of the thread is non-permanent residents and non Citizens. The title of the post even says "non-permanent". Permanent residents should qualify as well as natural citizens. "Non-permanent" carries with it the possibility that people may be here as a free ride on the system. The same thing goes for non-permanent residents who are already exempt from our healthcare system. That debate may go on. But the current law says those kids are Canadian citizens. I never said anything about PR holders.
