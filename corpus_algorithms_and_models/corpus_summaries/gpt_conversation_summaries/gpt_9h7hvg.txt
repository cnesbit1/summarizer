I host small rides through meetup (no charge of course) and have been wondering about liability. If a a rider went down, would I be held responsible? If yes then maybe I should put a disclaimer on the meetup page. Anyone else run into this?  
I go on group rides occasionally. Everyone rides his own ride, and no one should be held responsible for someone else's actions. If someone goes down on a group ride, unless a fellow biker causes it, there's no one else to blame; certainly not the organizer. You are individuals who happen to be sharing a public resource, that's all.  
Dude it’s America. Some lady sued McDonald’s because she spilled hot coffee in her lap and won.  
Ah, the classic "I don't know what I'm talking about" example. Try actually looking it up. They kept the coffee obscenely hot and had been warned by authorities not to keep the coffee so hot several times because it was dangerous to both employees and customers. The woman got 3rd degree burns. You know what that means? THAT MEANS SHE WAS BURNED DOWN TO THE BONE. Try educating yourself instead of being ignorant. It's amazing how people's perception of you changes.  
The coffee was not just “hot,” but dangerously hot. McDonald’s corporate policy was to serve it at a temperature that could cause serious burns in seconds. Mrs. Liebeck’s injuries were far from frivolous. She was wearing sweatpants that absorbed the coffee and kept it against her skin. She suffered third-degree burns (the most serious kind) and required skin grafts on her inner thighs and elsewhere.  
Liebeck’s case was far from an isolated event. McDonald’s had received more than 700 previous reports of injury from its coffee, including reports of third-degree burns, and had paid settlements in some cases.
