The timing was fine. His past misconduct is relevant to his nomination. She came forward shortly after he was nominated. She originally spoke about it with her therapist in 2012, when there was still a Democratic president in office. Just because she is accusing someone in the public sphere of a very serious thing doesn't mean she deserves to have her face and name shown all over. An assault is traumatic and having her character and life smeared in front of the entire country by the people that dont believe is what she wanted to avoid. Of course she will come out with her allegations when he is being nominated to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court. This directly relates to his character and morals and will effect all Americans for decades to come. If she was lying, why is she asking for a formal investigation by the FBI? If she has so much to lose, why would she bother? Maybe she didn't ever want to come forward because of the fallout she knew would hit her. She hoped she could forget about it. Then it became imminent that he could make it to a position of huge power so she was compelled to help stop that. No. Politicians politicized it. A victim has the right to come forward at any time they choose. Maybe she's only come forward now because she feels that an attempted rapist wouldn't make a good supreme court justice. That's correct. She came forward in July which was the appropriate time. People shouldn't be blaming Dr. Ford at all for any of this, she did everything she was supposed to. There aren't many people who sit around, combing through the newspapers for the names of federal judges. But people do care about the Supreme Court nominees because those are in the national news and really hard to ignore. Probably to avoid having her life turned upside down, you know, like what has happened. She’s received death threats and has had to move from her home. She is accusing someone publicly. She should not get to do it anonymously in the public sphere. If she had made her accusations to law enforcement in private then yes anonymity would have been an option. She did not. The burden of proof for declining to appoint a judge is not the same as the burden of proof for convicting someone. It’s not like we’re sending this guy to jail, it’s the SCOTUS, the standards should be higher. She still spoke about it and she discussed who he was. Testimony is evidence. She also reported it to her therapist several years ago.
