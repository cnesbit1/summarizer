I keep forgetting how loaded the leafs are up front . Like I knew they were strong, but literally any one of their top 6 could arguably a 1st line player on most other teams. Not sure if you're being sarcastic but I dunno, just cause a player gets 1st line time doesn't make them a first liner. They definitely have a great top 6, but it's not god like and it's not even the best in the league IMO. Crosby/Malkin are better than any Leafs player. However, as top 6 goes, the Leafs have a better “group.” If anything, I think it speaks to how great both teams top 6 are. Tavares, Matthews, and Marner would be first liners on pretty well every team, or they're playing a 1a/1b role with the same minutes and equal PP time. Nylander, Kadri and Marleau are 1st liners on most teams, and top end 2nd liners are some others.
