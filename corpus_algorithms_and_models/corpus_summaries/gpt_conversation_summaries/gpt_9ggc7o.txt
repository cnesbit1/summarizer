The most stupid part of the original pizza gate story (i think people have tried to use pizza gate for any high powered pedo people in USA) is that some how its only Democrats. If original pizzagate story was about Washington politicians from both parties instead of just one party it might have made more sense even with out any hard facts like at the moment. 

I have an unpopular opinion that I may be eaten alive for here... IF the russians had bots pumping shit out online and did influence the election maybe this was one of their attempts to distract and it actually stuck with little effort. 

Anyone who frequently spent time with Epstein is heavily suspect IMO. 

Sometimes I think this will never turn around no matter how much we expose. They don't even care. 

Both political partys have been involved for decades. 

Trump was friends with Jeffrey Epstein. He even said "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy. He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 

If you're trying to control politics through pedophile blackmail then your not going to focus on just one side of the house. 

Has Trump been to epsteins island? If so then there is certainly a pizzagate link there. 

From my understanding, Trump found in Epstein's flight logs exactly once. By comparison, Bill Clinton was found some 15 or so times.
