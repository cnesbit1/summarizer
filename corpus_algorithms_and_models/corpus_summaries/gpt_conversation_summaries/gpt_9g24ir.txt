Five days ago, my fiancee and I decided to evacuate from a city directly on the coast of North Carolina with our two children, due to record storm surge predictions and possible flooding. Two days ago was when everything got real. I won the N.C. educational lottery ($50,000) in a second chance drawing for scratch off cards that weren’t winners. Awesome, right? Nope. The NCEL refuses to disburse winnings without a valid drivers license and social security card. My license and social security card are located in our apartment back near the coast, which experienced 5 feet of flood waters so far, and is close to collapsing in on itself. We are currently staying at my fiancées mother’s house in VA, and currently have no plans on how to move forward. I am thankful that we are safe. I am hoping that my friends and family who stayed in the path of Florence are all safe. I would give anything for this all to be a dream, and wake up without having won the lottery or a hurricane bearing down on everything I hold dear. TL;DR evacuated from the path of a major hurricane. Forgot documents required to claim lotto winnings. The real TIFU is leaving your IDs in a house you are temporarily abandoning. It’s hard to think straight when you’re in that situation. I acknowledge that it was a major fuck up. People who are evacuating ASAP from a natural disaster while trying to secure their dwelling while they’re gone, calm their children, and secure accommodations for the immediate future. That’s who.
