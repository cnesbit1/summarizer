I have thousands of dollars of debt from University choices that didn’t pan out. The Government won’t give me benifits cause of it. Paycheques feel small and always far away. While the boss buys thousands of dollars of lottery tickets every month. I’d like a change.  
Then make a change.  Your boss doing well has absolutely nothing to do with you doing poorly.  It sucks that university didn’t work out, but there must be something else out there for you that pays better.  The government doesn’t owe you benefits because you spent money you didn’t have on a university course you didn’t like/couldn’t handle.  
So you want the government to take care of you? Grow up.  
Yet you're pouting about your University debts, government benefits, low pay, and your boss having more money than you.  
Take some responsibility for your own life.  
If I was on welfare I would agree with you but I’m hauling ass at my job every shift. The point of what I said was about the income difference being so ridiculous. If your an upper middle class person saying this to me, fuck right off.  
I really hope other people don't think like you. This is how we get millions of redditors masturbating in sub reddits like socialism and communism thinking their poor choices aren't their own faults and successful people must pay.  
Equalizing income or eliminating "disparity" is not an answer to anything. Some people are more successful than others; the world has always been that way.
