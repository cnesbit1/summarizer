He’ll accept it... for now.  
pretty girl at work said that this is how her current bf got her. they split up because he was abusive, years later he wouldnt leave her alone, ignoring her rejections, went wherever she went. eventually she thought it was sweet and that he must really love her so got back with him. she constantly complains about his behaviour, pretty much emotional abuse as far as i can tell. she wont leave him now, he won, she doesnt think she will get anyone as good as him ever again because she thinks she is fat and stupid... sad  
All the classic hallmarks of an abuser  
Have her check out emotional/domestic abuse.  
She sounds like a typical abused person and it's sad, but they can't see how badly treated they are until someone spells it out for them.  
The abuser controls mostly by fear. When someone has been threatened thousands of times with death if they were to leave, choosing to leave *means* choosing death. That’s on top of not having a shred of self esteem left. The hopelessness is soul shattering.  
Abused people generally can't/won't leave an abusive relationship until they're ready. It's difficult for them to leave for a lot of reasons. Mostly because their abusers have worn them down physically, mentally, or in both ways. It's frustrating for those looking on from the outside, because it's easy to just pick up and leave the abuser. From the abused person's perspective, it's like there's no way they can escape their situation. Please try to be patient with your coworker. Be there for her as much as you are able.  
I would like to point out that often it isn't a threat of death, either direct or indirect. It is a threat of 'you will have nothing if you leave me'. The abuser often claims that all the income is theirs and if you leave you have to leave the money behind... even if you are the one who works. They will have separated you from your friends and family by convincing you that your friends and family are horrible people, and they make sure that situations happen that makes that look like it is true. So you have no one to run to when you are truly ready to leave, at least in your mind. They have convinced you that the only person who could ever care for you, provide for you (even if you are the one providing), and make sure you live the best life you can live is the abuser. Leaving that is death in many ways. They
