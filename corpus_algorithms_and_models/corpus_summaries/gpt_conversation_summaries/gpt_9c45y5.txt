Papadopoulos is being charged with lying to the FBI. He is not being charged with any kind of collusion. He sentencing has been delayed again. The closest the Papadopoulos ever came to anyone Russian is when Stefan Halper honeypotted him.  
Flipping a witness is not the same as charging someone to compose.  
Is it an issue that Flynn, Page and Papadopolous were all honeypotted by Halper while Halper was being paid by the FBI? Isn't that collusion?  
Here's the thing: when someone pleads guilty to lying to investigators, it's because investigators know *everything*. He doesn't have any room to say anything except for what he knows to be true, otherwise he's going to jail basically forever.  
You can verify everything the piece talks about. Mueller is wildly inconsistent when it comes to "justice" and he has gone after people for crimes they did not commit.  
The fact you are being downvoted for this shows how far this sub was hijacked. War-hawk neocon talking points on Russia alongside anti-Israeli/pro-Iranian propaganda on this sub.  
Mueller has been discrediting himself for the last two decades. He really doesn't need much help.  
Carter page is relevant because he's much like George P as he was a low level Trump associate used in the investigation.  
You must be aware that there are theories that george was set up, right?  
Also, the story the thread is about is rather laughable. George proposed a meeting and Trump ok'd it? Where's the problem exactly?
