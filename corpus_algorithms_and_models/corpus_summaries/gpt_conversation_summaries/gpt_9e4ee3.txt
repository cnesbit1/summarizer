But it does seem odd that Air Canada flew their luggage home without them on the plane; thatâ€™s typically a big no-no.  
The judgement is already done and Air Canada lost.  
The tribunal said that Jet Airways was also responsible.  
&gt; Air Canada said the family had to disembark because Teesha was ill and her safety could be compromised if her condition worsened mid-flight. If she required an emergency landing, that would inconvenience other passengers, the airline said.  
&gt;According to the commission's decision, Teesha may have vomited, not because she was sick, but due to the smell from the plane's washroom.  
&gt;It also said Air Canada shouldn't have diagnosed the child without seeking medical attention.  
&gt;"An air hostess cannot decide if somebody's sick or unfit to travel," said Mittal.  
Yes, which is why they should have had her checked out by a qualified medical professional before kicking her off, as the court said as well.  
Its understandable for the airline to presume shes moderatey ill and say "we cant do that". But if you are giving yourself that authority then help the family get their luggage back and get them a hotel for the night since the corporartion is the party that doesnt think shes well enough to fly. Dont just abandon them in the damn airport with a sick preteen and young child in the middle of the night!  
There is a reason why the airlines don't send luggage on a different plane than the passengers, particularly by request.
