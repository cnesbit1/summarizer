Whoa... You know you done some bad shit when they send SWAT to come get you.  
Or you went fishing illegally.  
Or made fun of the government  
Or you jaywalked  
Or you smoked under a shelter  
Or you utterly wrecked the chief of police in a game of CS:GO  
If that happens they come for you in the middle of the night, not in broad daylight  
Or illegal football betting like in the ad.  
Or maybe you've won some online game and that sore loser think swatting is funny.  
or it was Just a Prank Bro  
Or you jaywalked on the way home
