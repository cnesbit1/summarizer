In Ohio too. I actually drove by one of the Rhoden houses the day after it happened going to Athens. Super surreal hearing about it on the news, turning a corner on 32, and then bam, news trucks and cop cars all over the place. I remember hearing that cartel/rival drug gang was a top rumor right after it happened. Seemed like the Rhoden family was involved in some shady stuff. I don’t think it was *the* cartels though, because as I recall there was a child left unharmed in one of the houses, and it seems to me that the legit cartels would have just killed him too. They aren’t really known for their “moral code” and IMO a cartel hit squad would have just killed everyone and everything in the houses. I really hope they close this one one day because it’s been super fascinating from the start. Ohio resident here. Operation was not large at all. They had a dozen plants or so. Nothing worth cartel involvement. Sorry I just looked it up, it was around 200 total plants but even that isn't anything the cartel would get involved with. There were 2 children I think. They only left those ima me to make an identification alive so I think cartel is still very possible. I believe it was a bigger set up than 12 plants. They had a whole grow set up that was probably worth a good bit. 200 plants really isn't a lot for a redneck grow op.
