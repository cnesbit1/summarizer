I hate when men think just because you’re a girl you can’t carry your own weight. I have customers tell me that because I’m a girl I shouldn’t be working in a shop by myself. I can tell you now that anyone who’s ever tried stealing whilst I’ve been working has either stumbled out the shop a shaking wreck or never come back. I also grew up playing tag teams with my 2 older brothers. So I can definitely fight a man.
