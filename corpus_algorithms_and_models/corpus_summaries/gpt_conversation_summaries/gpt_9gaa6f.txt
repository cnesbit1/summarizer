I'll start with how I met my girlfriend. We were at a summer camp, (we're both juniors) and things happened in that two week period that resulted in a relationship. However, she lives in Seattle, while I'm down in North Carolina, literally right off the path of Florence (which I really hoped and still hope would/will come and kill me). Speaking of Hurricane Florence, it was actually the reason she came over; for, two days ago, with odd motives, she had traveled over to Wilmington rather than California for the beach with a group of her friends, and obviously was in direct path of the storm. Me, seeing her story on Instagram, was an idiot and offered to give her stay. I then proceeded to start telling my parents about this, where my dad just sat there silent and looking amused why my mom was getting increasingly infuriated. My dad, on the other hand, seemed more relieved that I wasn't a complete social outcast and a homosexual (because from his time, especially where he comes from, China, this is kinda big) and let it pass, which was the complete opposite of what I was thinking. Now the first night we didn't do anything really, just slept (me for about 3 hours) but the second night we did; I actually blame the person at my camp for giving me an way oversized condom because I brought Cards Against Humanity over and he had multiple condoms to give out. This ended with the condom leaking, and some surprise and stress, followed up by a pregnancy test which resulted in a positive. I'm gonna go look at a doctor to make sure that the baby isn't real, because, according to the helpful and supporting comments, the only possible causes were a prior pregnancy and a really shitty test. I kinda just overreacted and posted this, literally a tifu within a tifu.
