Will circles life be bringing in the xs max?  
Yeah I hope so too, the singtel prices are so expensive what the hell  
Can’t blame them. The phone is expensive as hell.  
If you think they'll make it cheaper, I have bad news for you...  
I'm hoping that singtel will bring it as a lease option in, as that seems to be the most affordable option  
Yeah but their plans with phone (if you pay by installment is 65 a month) which is crazy ridiculous  
I’m currently using M1 and am paying 80 per month soo....  
Oh then that's actually fine. What phone will you be upgrading from?  
6s plus  
&gt;singtel prices are so expensive  

Why did you not blame the exorbitant iphone?
