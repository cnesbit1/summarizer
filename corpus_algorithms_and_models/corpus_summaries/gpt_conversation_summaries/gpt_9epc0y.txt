&gt;A 28-year-old Burnaby, B.C., man with no previous criminal record has been charged with the first-degree murder of 13-year-old Marrisa Shen.

&gt;Ibrahim Ali was arrested Sept. 7 in Burnaby. Police say he is a Syrian national and a permanent Canadian resident who arrived in the country 17 months ago.

As a fellow Canadian and Muslim I am ashamed of this act.

To those who are mixing this with immigration; let's not confuse merit-based immigration of skilled professionals with uncontrolled immigration of unskilled, single person migrants from war zones.

What evidence do you have that allowing in more refugees endangers Canadians?

I don't think any of us on Reddit have real evidence about anything. Most of our so called evidences are from news websites which have repeatedly proven to be partisan. So those evidences could not be trusted.

If this was not enough, our stupid PM has resettled 2 dozen ISIS fighters back. We don't know where they are. So far we have seen one refugee attack in Edmonton last year, one incident ( which didn't turn in to attack) in Scarborough, Ontario and there might be more that I don't know. Like still we don't know the story behind the Danforth mass shooter - what was the motive, who wiped his online presence? We don't know and probably will never know because it doesn't fit the narrative.

But these attacks puts law abiding citizens like us in a bad situation. So for me if saying no to 1000s of refugees or illegals can save even one life; I am all for it.

What evidence do you have that immigrants of any status commit more crimes than Canadians in general? What statistical significance do you believe this particular crime has to that question, snd why?
