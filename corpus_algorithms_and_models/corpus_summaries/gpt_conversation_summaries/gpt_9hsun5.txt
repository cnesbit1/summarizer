I remember Karlsson's draft he was a "work in progress" and looked like a child. I think its cause he's super young to be drafted too if I recall. Like barely made the cutoff? Its the same with guys like Jeff Skinner who looked insanely young. He seems pretty physically mature for an 18 year old though even if his face looks young. He has the potential to be a big skilled player. Like Kopitar. Yeah where as Karlsson was literally like 5'10" and 150 pounds when he was drafted. Kotka is already big (can def fill out more tho) just with a baby face. Yeah he was the youngest player in the draft - his birthday is the day of the cutoff (Sept 15th - so he just turned 18 last week). They're both undersized guys who has been underrated and I really hope they do well today. SDA's main drawback is his skating so we basically have to hope Timashov and Mueller open up the ice for him. Timashov is a prospect I've been excited for since draft day in 2015. He was a 5th round pick who's undersized but a smooth skater and some great offensive talent. The good news is that he's improved a lot over the last year.
