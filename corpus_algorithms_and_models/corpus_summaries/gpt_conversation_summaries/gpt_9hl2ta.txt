I've talked to a lot of people (as recently as a few days ago) whose impression of Singaporeans is about how they complain too much (on the internet), and I usually counter it with "how is that any different from whiny comments on popular news articles in your country?" As a foreigner myself, I find the social media comments from my home country (India) in news posts way worse than what I see here in Singapore. The sheer amount of pettiness, whininess, stupidity and negativity is staggering. And in multiple languages too.

That said, what with the comments from Nas Daily, and how Singaporeans are getting a lot of flak for being whiny in the comments, is the "whiny Singaporean" perception really accurate? Local Singaporeans who haven't lived outside (traveling doesn't really count, imho) would definitely say it's true, but as with any local population with limited exposure to bread-and-butter issues of other countries, it's easy to assume any common behaviour as uniquely Singaporean.

Can confirm, went for a stint in London. Met some sg, Malaysians and Filipinos people there. More often that not, sg really look down on sg while saying how much better London is in comparison. While the Malaysians are proud of what Malaysia has become but acknowledge that it has some issues and are optimistic towards it future growth. The filipinos of the other hand are glad to have their leader "fixing" their country whatever that means. All in all sgs are more toxic and hateful towards their own country compared to the Malaysians and the Filipinos who were quite chill.

I feel what you're describing about Singaporeans overseas is that of the self-loathing foreigner: a first-gen migrant, or a foreigner in a country with greater aspirational value tends to disown their origins and culture in an attempt to belong, to integrate. Every foreigner goes through this phase, it's very common, and I think it's a different issue entirely.
