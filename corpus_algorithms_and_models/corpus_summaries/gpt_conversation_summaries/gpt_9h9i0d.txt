Today was the first time I've had sex in 3 years since my other girlfriend cheated on me. Everyday during my workouts I work on my PC muscle doing Kegel exercises. Strengthening the PC muscle helps with many things, it even can delay ejaculation if it's strong enough, but most of the time what it does is when you squeeze that muscle it makes your penis move in an upward motion if strong enough. I cannot stress enough that strengthening the pelvic floor is such a great thing and I discovered that today and I am super ecstatic at this moment that I was able to give a woman a sensation she never felt before. Next time you are peeing I want you to focus on stopping the Stream. And the muscle you use to stop the stream of pee is the PC muscle and that is the muscle you want to isolate and work. There are several areas of level to clench, one roughly around the anus and two roughly around the penis. Learning to relax each one is just as important as contacting them, in my opinion. You're using the wrong muscles I guess, and you're not the only one, male or female. You need to visit an physiotherapist that is specialized in the pelvic. It's worth the money, and it can improve other things as well, like your toilet visits. I don't think that restricting semen is very healthy, you can cause backup problems that way. I think that controlling the muscle contractions is more important, and letting the semen flow is fine.
