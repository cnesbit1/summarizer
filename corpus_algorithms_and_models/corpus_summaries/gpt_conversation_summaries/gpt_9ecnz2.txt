Sen. Collins has her eyes on the governorship in Maine and knowing that each of the coat hangers is tied to an actual Maine voter is *exactly* the sort of thing that will get her attention.  
US politican logic. If they want to win an election they need votes and money. It's pretty straightforward.  
How is it blackmail? If she supports Kavanaugh, they’re essentially saying they won’t vote for her? That’s literally how politics works. (Well, is supposed to work.) You vote for the candidate that you feel best represents your interests. You determine if they best represent your interests by things like what they say, how they vote, and what they support. If you disagree, you don’t vote for them.  
What is indecent about reminding those who represent us that we cannot go back?  
It's "tasteless".  
You know what's more than tasteless? Wanting to allow more more people who need/want abortions to die/get seriously hurt because of your own personal beliefs and money.  
This isn't about opening her eyes to her own corruption.  It's about making it crystal clear that her future aspirations could be impacted by this decision.  And then letting her decide what is in her best interest.  Its just another form of bribery.  
Politicians aren't "bribed" by their constituents. They are selected by the people to represent them. If the people choose someone else because Collins failed to represent their interests, she cannot then complain that she was extorted at her job of being a representative.  
Activism is still important and it matters  
If she goes on to vote affirm him, the people who participated in this can say they tried to change the course. That in and itself is something.  
You, as a private citizen, are literally unable to bribe your politicians. You elect them to represent you, and in return, they are expected to follow through on their campaign promises and act in the best interests of their constituents.  
Telling a senator that an issue is important enough to you that it will effect whether or not you vote for them is neither a threat nor extortion.
