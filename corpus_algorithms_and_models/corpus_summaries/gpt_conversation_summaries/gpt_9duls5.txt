My husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. I didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

"Did you call 911???" My husband asked, "tell them it was an accident!!"

So I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says "we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

"The police are coming."

I calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn't mention the spanking.

Apparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. "He told you about our contract?"

I go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we're going to do that again.

TL;DR TIFU by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy BDSM session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

Edit: iWatch doesn't exist. &lt;3

EDIT: Holy shit. Thanks for the gold!! And the front page. I'm freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened.
