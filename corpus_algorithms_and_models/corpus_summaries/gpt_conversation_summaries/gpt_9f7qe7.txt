No teaching of children about homosexuality

No housing benefits which are specifically for straight couples

Dont start suing businesses who refuse to participate in your gay wedding

Also, key to acceptance is through awareness, awareness can only be achieved (at least in this country) via dialogue. Mr goh's aim is to minimise that. So how can this kind of compromise work towards acceptance?

Teaching children that it is ok to identify as gay/lesbian and the society wouldn't treat them unfairly, and their family would accept them for who they are, along with safe sex techniques isn't equality?

Why is teaching kids about your sexuality branded as an equal right?

With unrestricted access for religious institution and parents to demonise the lgbt and a censorship towards lgbt content unless they are villians or suffer before dying a horrible death. Its no wonder why we are where we are regarding the lgbt issue.

They need to be educated because the vast majority of adults arent. To get these adults, their parents, to teach them is like asking a primary school kid to teach someone in jc. They are going to screw up.

By teaching about the real disadvantages of homosexuality, we can at least discourage them from being homo when they eventually find SJWs online preaching homosexuality

Maybe if children were taught actual facts about homosexuality, like it is not a lifestyle but it is how you are born and not the blatant lies circling around from religious groups etc, just maybe the rampant homophobia here would die down.
