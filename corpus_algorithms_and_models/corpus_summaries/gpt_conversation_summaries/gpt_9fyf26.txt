The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states clearly: 'Free and informed consent must be respected in the fields of medicine and biology'. To mandate vaccinations is to deny this fundamental freedom.

Six million British people, mostly children, received the vaccine but tragically, [60 people in the UK](https://web.archive.org/web/20150709170911/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Health/article1382119.ece) suffered side effects, committing them to an incurable and lifelong condition (1).

They are about to receive a multi-million-pound payout from the government as compensation for their **swine flu vaccine-induced brain damage** (narcolepsy and cataplexy).

In some countries (Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia and others), medical or religious exemptions do not even apply.

If vaccines have the potential to cause serious harm and even death, then mandating them for every child is not only Russian Roulette but totally unethical - all the more so as the state does not look after the injured or cover all the costs.

Mandating a procedure that may spread disease or may not 'protect' from disease therefore needs serious re-thinking.

The EFVV petition is however not about vaccines and their worth per se, but about human rights.

Informed choice is vital in a democracy. Mandating vaccines actually goes against at least a dozen European ethical documents, including the [Nuremberg Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20150709170911/http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/nuremberg.pdf). (14)
