Just don't go to the US unless you need to. Its that simple. A backwards country doesn't need our support.

Facts and logic hasn't worked, appeals to decency haven't worked. Common sense hasn't worked. If the only thing they care about is how things appear to be, make that the leverage point, and make it appear that supporting a monster will get you public shame and ridicule.

If you look at the current US administration and see merit, you are either supporting the onset of fascism in the US, or you're being played like a fool. It's not a "Left vs Right" issue. It's an issue of "Has PT Barnum pulled one over on you."

There's a serious problem with the leadership of the most prominent country in the world. And half the discussion is about how people are crazy for saying there's a problem. That's fucked up, and the discussion needs to move past this disingenuous part of the argument in order to actually be productive.

If you want an open and honest discussion, the discussion needs to take place in a world where the things Trump has done and said are treated as things that he both actually said and did, and that he meant them.

Shame doesnâ€™t work. Those Trumptards voted for him in private and denied supporting him in public.

There are crazy liberals and there are crazy Republicans, but that doesn't mean you should generalize everybody based on some.

Fox News' "agenda setting" use goes well past all competitors. They outright ignore stories they cannot spin favorably, and the amount of times their top story is laughably irrelevant because the real top story of the day goes against the editorial narrative is far higher than other news networks.

Shame is an effective normalizer of behaviour. As I briefly mentioned, the Nudge Unit in the UK uses shame to get better tax filing results.
