1) Homosexuality (damn. this gets brought up a lot doesnt it). To be more specific: How can we love gays, regardless of whether we affirm it or reject it.

2) New Perspective on Paul. I personally had always suspected that historically Christians have forgotten how Jewish the Pauline Epistles were. Modern theology rests upon a bedrock of anti-semitism and ahistorical ignorance of how Jewish the entire Bible really is.

3) God's goodness. Whenever I hear John Piper speak of God's sovereignty apart from God's goodness (e.g. saying that God is glorified when people are predestined for hell and are burnt in hell forever for his glory), I frankly want to puke, even though the rest of his theology is pretty darn good.

4) How God's justice relates to God's mercy. (e.g. does God's mercy means we dont seek God's justice, e.g. when someone is raped and she forgives the rapist, does this means she doesnt seek justice?)

As a gay person, I think the answer is that you can't love me while telling me you don't support the most meaningful human relationship in my life.

I've always compared it to how I'm a christian and I have atheist friends who say stuff like "all religious people are mentally damaged" or "Religion is the root of so much violence in the world, we should just lock them up and stamp it out (except you /u/CharlesComm, you're the exception)".

The point I'm trying to get at is that the criteria for loving behavior can't *just* be whether someone genuinely believes they're invested in another's best interest.

The things is, people disagree on what is and isn't sin.

Now, take that example, which is a choice, and apply it to homosexuality, which isn't a choice.

That's exactly why I don't really buy the sincere best interest defense.

On the other hand, sexual orientation is something that can't be changed.
