The real fuck up was not bringing high school shenanigans to the party. Wtf i live in Silicon Valley where Id like to think weâ€™re the first people to get stupidly unnecessary innovations and all of our bathrooms still have paper towels. All of the bathrooms in my area, aside from those in homes, have shitty hand dryer things. No paper towels. What school do you go to where 30 students is a small class?? Well the average class at my uni is 250, so 30 students lecture is really small in comparison. At my school the average class size is somewhere around 100-200 lol. Only honors classes get small sizes like that! Well, to be fair, the classroom was really tiny and could only seat about 5 or 6 people. 2 was the expected number of attendees. Ha! I wish! This was at a community college! Where do you live? Auditorium are specially made for this kind of class. They can accommodate hundreds of people. It's super common in most universities to have 100+ students in a class. In Canada at least. I have a class with 6 students total, including me. If one of us drops out, then the next class in this series of classes will get canceled. It's going to be just the 6 of us until the end of the final class. Nobody else wanted to move on, since the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th class in the series aren't mandatory.
