I was at the mall and needed to use the head so I stopped into the bathroom. While relieving myself I decided to check my email and give social a quick scroll. I finished my business, went for a quick zip and promptly caught myself in my zipper. I want to give a huge shout out to my amazing wife who came home from work to help me free myself which saved me an ER visit (probably $500). We were able to remove the zipper from the pants with a good kitchen shears. We then used astroglide to free the zipper. Wasn't paying attention and caught myself in pants zipper. Wife cut zipper out of pants and free'ed my little guy from the zipper head with lube. Photo was taken after attempting to free myself. It was the easiest way of explaining the situation to my wife and asking for her help.
