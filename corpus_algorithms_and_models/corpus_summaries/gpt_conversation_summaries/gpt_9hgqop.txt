New tyres are slippery for the first 100miles or so.  
But honestly if you are not on a track then I don’t see the real need to be leaning that far over in corners.  
No they clearly aren’t new but if the edges have never been used then those areas are still “new”  
Because those edges of the tyre haven’t been used before they are still in that “new” period.  
The only way to get rid of that slippery-ness is to ride on them. Take the bike out on a twisty road and start off slowly easing into the corners, getting lower each time.  
But honestly I don’t see why you would really want to get that low. You are risking a crash for nothing.  
The middle is clearly used. Then you can see where it’s slightly dulled by cornering. Then the edges which are still shiny because he hasn’t used them.  
It looks like the bike is mostly highway used. No need for the edges of the tyres on a straight highway.  
All he asked was why are they slippery... so I told him they were unused.  
If you use them daily then you either live in a very twisty area or ride like a dick. Like I said 99% of riders don’t need those areas.  
It’s fine if he wants to use those areas of his tyre (no one is stopping him) but as I advised before he is better off doing it at a track day. He can learn more about his tyres and how they work whilst being safe and not putting lives in danger.  
Yes they haven't been used, and you correctly said they were slippy as they were unused, you then proceeded to call the the illegal zone and the idiot zone, do you see how this could annoy someone that uses them perfectly legally and has never been in accident would take um-bridge at this?  
That was pretty much the point of my post is that i want to use those parts of the tires and lean more so you’re right.
