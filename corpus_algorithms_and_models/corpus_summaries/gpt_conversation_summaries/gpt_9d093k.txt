Today I went over 20 for the first time and it is ridoculous...ly awesome. First time going into 3rd gear. This is a whole new world and I'm fucking hooked. It was honestly a little bit scary, so I'll keep practing until I'm comfortable with emergency maneuvers before going faster than that.

Wow, just wow. 300ccs is PLENTY. 

Bike 1: Rebel 250 I don’t see a need to go over 70 on a bike - too dangerous!

Bike 2: CTX 700

Oh man this bike can do 90! Ok I’ll never need to go faster than that.

Bike 3: ST1100

This is a couch that cruises at 110 all day. Too heavy, though.

Bike 6: RC51

1000cc V-Twin Superbike. Too specialized. Now I need two bikes. At least one other sport - don’t want to scruff up the RC! And a touring bike.... maybe I’ll get a cruiser too! Wait, how much garage space do I have? Maybe I should start buying fixer uppers...

I love RC51s. I had a VTR1000 for a while. Also an ST1100 for a time. Wonderful bike. I recently paired down and went to an FJR1300. Best of both worlds

Debating selling my st1100. Kind of a pigy compared to my speed triple, but damn she hauls on the freeway. Can go forever and do if faster than you realize. Like a sporty Cadillac.

And this is why the motorcycle industry stays alive! Stepping stones.

Ahhh yes the vfr

God I love me my vfr. Fantastic bike, Honda hit it out of the park

tldr: Rebel 250 = gateway drug :)
