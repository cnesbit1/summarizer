The skin was peeling on my hands, and though it didnâ€™t hurt, it was quite annoying. The brilliant idea came to use callous remover (it removes dead skin, right?) to take off the outer layer that was falling off. I put the callous remover in latex gloves, rubbed it around to distribute it around, then put my hands in. After about 1 minute, a searing pain began to shoot up my arms. The callous remover did its job, removing a layer or two of skin. The problem was that every small crevice in my hand, every wrinkle, and every groove deeper than a fingerprint ridge began to bleed. I was unable to move my fingers without reopening the cuts and restarting all the pain. I remained in that state for three days. Now, more than two weeks later, I feel fine to type this story. TL;DR I used callous remover to remove the skin on my hands. It did, and my hands bled with the pain of a thousand paper cuts. They get tons of stupid shit, and this is not the worst. My dad works in the hospital and he told me about some guy that had a que ball stuck up his ass.
