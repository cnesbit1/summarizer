He’s told you multiple times he’s seeing someone and I think it’s perfectly normal for someone who is now in a relationship to not follow people they hooked up with in the past. But if he’s in a new relationship and you guys hooked up, it’s not that unheard of for guys to unfollow girls they used to be involved with. My girlfriend did tell me to delete the girls she saw as a “threat” aka the girls I like the most. I can almost guarantee you he did this not because he didnt like you, but because he liked you too much! If he unfollowed you because he has a girlfriend, that would then mean he would have unfollowed all women. or perhaps all the "real, accessible women" that his new girlfriend found to be a threat because he has had relations with you at some point. who knows?!?! i think he unfollowed you because the content on your IG is not relevant to him. also, because he is no longer interested in pursuing any kind of relationship with you. Just the ones that are a danger to him. The rest is not important enough for him and her. How can anyone truly think unfollowimg EVERY GIRL YOU HAVE EVER KNOWN INCLUDING SISTERS COUSINS AND CHILDHOOD FRIENDS is a good idea when you get a gf? Because taking that much effort to block someone is something you only do when it’s really a challenge to let go.
