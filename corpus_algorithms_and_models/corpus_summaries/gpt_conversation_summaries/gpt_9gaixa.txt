Go back to living your life on your own schedule. Don't let her problems be your problems. And: if and when she ever knocks on your door again, get your gear off quick as fuck and answer the door buck naked. That will be the end of that.  
If OP is in a house, not an apartment, then tell these nosy fuckers to go fuck themselves louder if they are jealous.  
I would call the company that made the place and tell them that you need better sound insulation between the units. It might be sold as a "house" but to me, who has an actual house, it would be considered an apartment because it has a shared wall. You might also consider putting up sound insulation yourself.  
a shared wall to me means an apartment, not a house. I own a house. It has its own lot, and does not share any walls with anyone else. In fact, in most places, if it has a shared wall, it has to be listed as an (x)plex, or a "townhouse" which is a technical way of saying "apartment".  
I would tell your mom, the next time it comes up, to tell this prude to keep that shit to herself, because it only bothers her, and no one else.  
Townhouse is not a technical way of sayin apartment. Apartment is the technical way of saying apartment. Townhomes are generally adjoined homes with shared walls but no one above, so either multi story or single story but still no one above.
