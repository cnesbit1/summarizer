I have Aspergers and have never been medicated for it, the only one's who are, are those who need it to function properly.  
I'm medically diagnosed by a doctor who knows what's best for his patients.  
In the UK, medicine is free, it costs the government money, they don't prescribe medicine unless they have to because it costs the patient £0 but costs the government the inflated prices charged because of the backwards American system.  
Stop saying you have 'free' medical care. You pay higher taxes to pay for it.  
Doctors aren't treating you out of the goodness of their heart.  
They get paid the same wether or not they prescribe medicine, you know that right?  
It's a matter of opinion. You enjoy your government stealing your money and buying healthcare for you.  
Lol you can't sue a doctor in the US.  
Better medical assistance? Get real. People travel all over the globe to get treated in the US.  
It’s law that if you go to the emergency room, they have to treat you.  
Stop saying you have free sidewalks, free parks, free clean air, free roads to drive on, free anything. You pay taxes on it all.  
US isn't taxed for the first 26k under our new tax plan.  
Perhaps is we wasn't policing the entire world, we wouldn't need a huge military.  
Emergency rooms bill you. It's against the law to not treat you.  
The US collects 26% of GDP in taxes, the U.K. is 34%.
