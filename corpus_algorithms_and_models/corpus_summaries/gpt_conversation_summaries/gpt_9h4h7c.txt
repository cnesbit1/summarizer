A 17 year-old who commits rape is usually considered an adult. Older teenagers generally only get to be tried as minors for less significant crimes.  
True, but the sealing of records does not happen automatically. It has to be reviewed by a judge and may not be approved. For a 17yo, they may at the least wait a while to see if there's recidivism.  
Sealed records are also not sealed to everyone. The military, for example, see everything. It's also reviewed during government background checks, like this one. They probably wouldn't bring it up in the public hearings though.  
Commission of a serious, violent felony at 17 should (and in many case does) result in being tried as an adult.  
Rape, or attempted rape, is not "most crimes." To suggest it should be sealed like a minor in possession or petty theft charge downplays its severity. Which is the whole point of OP's post.  
Government servants serve the government. The government is supposed to serve the public. The public approves or disapproves of their officials and representatives. That shouldn’t be considered a bug in a representative democracy, it’s a feature.  
We're also talking about the difference between criminal punishment and a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land  
I mean, yeah. He's up for a vote of confidence by our Representatives, not on trial. Public opinion is the only thing that ever mattered here, even before these allegations.  
Even before the allegations his approval among voters and both the house and Senate was at a historical low for any SCOTUS nominee. All it would take is two republicans deciding they can't support him for the position and he will be out.
