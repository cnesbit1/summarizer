In kindergarten, I've always envied the games boys played, tried to sit at the boy's table, and felt like I was in the wrong place when the teachers told us to get into groups of boys and girls. In middle school I started to accept my femininity more, discovering the joy of fashion and makeup. But recently, in college, my issues with gender are coming up again. I basically feel like men are better at all the things that I want to be good at, which is totally a sexist bias that I have, and I hate it. Men have been taking credit for women's work and discoveries for centuries. Frankenstein, one of the greatest literary works of all time, was first puplished anonymously because puplishers wouldnt believe it was written by a women. By saying that you feel men are superior to women, you are only confirming that the male brainwashing you've been exposed to all your life has worked. I also think the idea that a female has to be feminine and a male has to be masculine is total bullsh/t. Without Rosalind Franklin they never would have discovered DNA but they were sexist assholes to her and refused to give any credit. Marie Curie, who discovered radioactivity, almost had her work stolen with no credit by her male colleagues. **In 2018 it is still happening.**
