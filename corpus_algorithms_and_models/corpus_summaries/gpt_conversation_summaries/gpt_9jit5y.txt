It's hurting me to see how many men are being so naive about this. It's not that you don't want to report it, every bone in your body itches for justice. However, in my situation and at that age, I couldn't. My abusers convinced me if I did they'd make everyone think I was gay. And it was 2 against 1 so I was convinced they were right. It was hell on earth dealing with this so young, being bullied so badly, having no one to help you deal with it.

My empathy goes out to many of you who faced similar stigmatisation, potential shame and confrontation. It’s something you never really understand until it happens to you.

Shame is so overwhelming. And it never gets easier. After multiple assaults and abusive situations I vowed to never let that shame stop me from reporting or telling people.

And yet every time I failed to tell anyone until it was too late for anything. It is never too late to share your truth, but I understand what you mean.

I know you know this based on your comment, but you did nothing and are doing nothing wrong. You are a survivor and no one can tell you that are doing that wrong.

We are all in a shitty club, but it does not define us. Honestly I tried but I just couldn't do it too. It was harder and probably more embaressing for me, a young make teen, but my best friend was raped and she said she related to mostly everything I feared

It's only these last 3 months I'm coming to terms with what happened and admitting it happened to me. For me I also hate describing myself as a “survivor” or a “victim” (disclaimer: this is my personal feeling on it and I’m 100% on board with whatever identity helps someone heal). I am me. One event in my life does not define me. He does not get any say in my identity. None of these men do. I deal with consequences of their actions and not my own. I much prefer to say that “I was raped.” Or even better “someone raped me.” Someone did a thing to me. I am not that thing.

I still get angry. So very angry. I don’t get sad anymore.

I’ve had people tell me to forgive so that I can heal but honestly that anger drives me to not get scared or sad. Forgiveness is mine to give or not give and when people tell me to forgive someone unrepentant who admits no wrongdoing I hate
