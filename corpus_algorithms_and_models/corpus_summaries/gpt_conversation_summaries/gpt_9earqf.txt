Well it turns out they do and Amazon and FB were creepy enough to let me know.  
I don’t have FB app on my phone. I always log out of FB. Have the prime video app only.  
If you've visited Google or Facebook on that instance, they use tracking to track you from site to site.  
I didn't have FB on my phone, and dont use it. Yet when I've had my phone lock up on me, one of the programs that pops up as failed, is FB.  
Android is Google’s operating system so if you have a droid there is no way around that one...  
I think just turn off permissions to your microphone? I have an iPhone X with latest iOS system and latest fb update and I never get these ads.  
&gt; I always log out of FB.  
This doesn't matter.  They track you offline.  
Sounds like they provided you a service. You has a question. Amazon had an answer. You didn't even need to search. They are definitely listening.  
A bunch of people at that party probably googled marshmallow cereal at or after the party and you guys started getting ads for it. It's not that wild.
