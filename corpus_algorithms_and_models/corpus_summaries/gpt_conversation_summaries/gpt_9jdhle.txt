Even if someone is too young to have done anything wrong, they're still conceived of sinful parents, and with a sinful nature. After all children don't need to be taught to lie, that comes naturally to them. They need to be taught to tell the truth. Children have a special humility to them that brings them close to god, but that doesn't mean they have a perfect sinless nature. All humans are conceived and born sinners except for Jesus Christ. You're not born a sinner, you're conceived a sinner. Psalm 51:5  " Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me." Does that mean Yeshua was a sinner? No. Why? A child isn’t aware of what is good and evil, especially someone who isn’t born yet. also it doesn't apply to Christ because he was not conceived by man. He is a man, is he not? It was said he was tried or tempted as we are but he did not sin. ‭‭Iḇ`rim (Hebrews)‬ ‭4:15‬ ‭TS2009‬‬http://bible.com/316/heb.4.15.ts2009 How did he do it? He overcame the lusts of the flesh.
