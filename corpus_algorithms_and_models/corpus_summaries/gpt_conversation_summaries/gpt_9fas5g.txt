No matter the context, the answer to "Can Jesus forgive him?" is yes.  
Except blasphemy, the only unforgivable sin per the new testament.  
Sin, in the new testament, is not considered a tally mark against you, but rather a state of being. So the point of that statement is that while one is in that state, there is no forgiveness. The point is not, "If you do this thing, you will never be forgiven."  
Beyond that, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is not the only unforgivable sin in the new testament. Not forgiving others is also an unforgivable sin.  
Suicide is "thou shalt not murder" with no chance of repentance after the murder takes place.  
The idea of "no repentance after death" is a markedly unchristian one.  
You can forgive them while still giving someone the freedom to choose. A good human being is someone who can forgive someone else despite the fact that they ur unrepentant. Why should we not hold God to the same standard?
