Get a seal buddy, or a block of wood. It sits between the wheel and the guard, allows you to strap down the bike without compressing the forks. And it's also not the right kind of trailer. This one puts all the weight on the tongue. No idea, but I know this particular type of "rack" is only meant for dirt bikes, that anything over 200-250lbs should be at least on a little collapsible trailer. Called a fork seal saver, it wedges between the wheel and the guard, the sticky outy bits on the side rest against the forks so it stays in place. It stops pressure from staying built up in the forks, when pressure builds inside, it can cause the seals to leak. If you have a bleed valve on your forks, you'll notice how much pressure actually builds. Another is condition of the spring inside the fork, it has a set length, and needs to be replaced when too far out of spec, too long under heavy compression can take it's toll (a standard trip isn't going to do anything though). I think in the past I've only had one seal go when strapped down, so it's not too bad, but using the seal saver in the front really works a treat, stops any bouncing when hitting bumps, good for peace of mind, knowing there won't be oily forks when I get to the riding spot.
