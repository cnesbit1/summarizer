He allowed them because he made them beings with free will, nothing stops anyone from sinning, even Jesus was tempted by the devil when he was in earth, when he was hungry after fasting in the desert but he did not subdue to it. God also could have allowed them to be tempted by the serpent to test their loyalties, Eve fell and if it was only her and not Adam then the world could have been different, but Adam loved his wife more than God so he listened to his wife and she loved herself so much and made herself her own god in a sense and part of the forbidden fruit, regardless of what God commanded. Satan was in heaven when he sinned along side the many angles that chose to side with him, I’d say that’s free will. Satan was the originator of sin which is why he was kicked out, sin will not return their. God wants us to be free from sin through his blood so he can cleanse us and take us to heaven, and because followers of Christ have the will to want to be with him he will erase their natural propensities to want to commit sin, because they want to be with him. Heaven has free will. At the end of the Book of Revelation, the gates of New Jerusalem never close. You can enter the City that is constant light and you can always leave to enter the darkness.
