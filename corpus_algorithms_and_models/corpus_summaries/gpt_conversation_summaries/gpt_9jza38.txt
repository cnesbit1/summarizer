A crack in a weld is always a bad thing but this doesn’t look too too bad. You could probably find a professional welder who will fill that in and weld it and it will be just fine. Replacing would be the best thing to do but frames can be costly and if you can’t afford it could be a temporary solution for a short time. Aluminum looses strength when welded, it needs a heat treatment to restore that strength, the cost to reweld and properly treat it would make the cost of a new one a far more reasonable option. There's so many alloys out there that it can be really hard to find the correct welding rod. Still might be just fine if welded... Some dealers buy crashed bikes, fix them up and sell them on without the buyers ever knowing. It's not the "right" thing to do by the book, but you may be okay... however welding aluminium is not cheap. A good condition used swing arm would cost about the same amount as repairing this one poorly and would be much cheaper than doing it properly. If you can't afford to ride/drive a safe vehicle, you shouldn't be on the road. I'm not a welder so I might be wrong, but since there's a crack doesn't that mean it's not straight? I am, I would grind it out and fix it if had alum experience. I suspect this was not welded correctly from day 1 though it looks like a good weld. If it's a clean break it's absolutely repairable.
