My husband works night shifts at the hospital a lot and so his schedule can be off even when he doesn’t work. The night before the fuck up, my husband had used my car to go the hardware store to go get some hooks. So, the fuck up - I was in line for the car wash the next morning with my dog in the back seat when I noticed this thing that looked like a squirt gun. “Cute”! I think. I pick it up. It says, “Pepper Blaster”. “Wow, it’s an spice grinder for camping, cool”. So I put the “spice gun” to my hand and press the trigger thinking I’ll get a spritz of salt and pepper. WRONG. Apparently pepper spray comes in gun form. It’s like a spring goes off and all of a sudden I’m covered in red. Did I shoot myself?! Is this blood? I’m dying?? And I’m sneezing. My dog is sneezing. And I’m trapped in the car wash line with no escape. Then my face starts to burn. And I look up and the red is all over the headliner. Somehow I go through the wash and drive home. Anyway, it resulted in me having my face in a bowl of milk and more than 4 hours of scrubbing the top off the car. I paid $200 to get the car head to toe detailed and It’s better but still there. I still pretend to blame my husband for leaving it there. TLDR: husband leaves pepper spray gun in car and grown woman pepper sprayed herself probably making it infinitely harder to sell her previously pristine car.
