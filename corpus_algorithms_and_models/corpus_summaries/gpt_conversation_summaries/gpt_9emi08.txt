he was also fired from his current team, and mv agusta terminated their contract with him as well.  
his reputation is done for. i don't think any team will ever pick him up again.  
I thought he was done when he upset Rossi and the VR46/Sky team but he somehow got another ride, hopefully this is it for good.  
i don't understand it either.  
the guy really is talented. he's one of the best. but if i were a team manager he would be a too big a risk that i would even dare burn my hands trying to get him to behave.  
Dorna/FIM should have thrown the book at him. That's attempted murder. Like another poster said what does he have to do to get a lifetime ban  
You'd figure that getting the boot from the VR46 academy/riding team while leading the championship would be a HUGE fucking red flag to everyone. Wasn't surprised that it didn't even take a full year for his stupidity to come out again, hopefully this is the last of it.
