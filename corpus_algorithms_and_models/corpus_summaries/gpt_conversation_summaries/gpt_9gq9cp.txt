I am physically sick from this and keep switching between vomiting and crying. I have more evidence than anyone should ever have proving the sexual harassment I have been dealing with for the past 3 weeks.

I have 42 pages of printed messages. Much of it me repeatedly telling him to stop, that I want to maintain a professional relationship, that I find this inappropriate.

In the three weeks since class started my fucking professor has asked me out 3 times, sent me numerous inappropriate texts, and refused to listen as I repeated told him I wanting nothing more than a student teacher relationship.

I had to go to the department head.

But I have to. Because the next girl might not have my metal.

The department head most likely already knows about the issue and will handle it the way it was handled last time, which was most likely to not handle it at all.

Technically the dept. head is required to go to the Title IX officer, but it doesnâ€™t hurt for the student to do it as well, just in case.

The department chair may be helpful, but the procedure would be to go to the Title IX officer who is trained to handle cases.

Also, as people have said, things do get swept under the rug at some universities, but with this clear proof and the threat of a lawsuit, I don't think this will if OP is willing to fight.
