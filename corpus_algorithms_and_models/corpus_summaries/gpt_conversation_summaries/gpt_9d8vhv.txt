I have a way higher sex drive than he does, and I get frustrated when he doesn’t want sex when I do. I know that isn’t fair, so last night when I wanted to initiate, and he said no I wanted to just have some me time to take care of my own needs. I don’t want to just whip out my vibrator in front of him when he says no, but I’m not sure how to get away to satisfy my self. I do want some privacy, but I’m not sure how to sneak away in those situations. Different people have different sex drives, and even things like stress can cause someone's sex drive to vary. Different sex drives are 100% a thing. It's not true. Different sex drives exist, regardless of the person's attractiveness. They could have different sex drives for any number of reasons. Having a talk about what makes the other person tick is most likely to lead to a solution.
