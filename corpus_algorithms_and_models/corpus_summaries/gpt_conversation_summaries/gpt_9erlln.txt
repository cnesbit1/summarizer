Started watching a dating variety show yesterday, and before I slept, I just felt overwhelming loneliness. It is hard when most of your friends are in a relationship/dating while you have had none of those experiences. You can't help but feel left behind, undesired and start to question what's wrong with yourself. 

Most of my friends are getting married. Meanwhile I have been single for 5 years lol. 

In the group of my JC friends (8,9 of us), only me and another guy are single. The rest are in long-term committed relationships. 

She said she didn't reciprocate the feelings, which is cool. We're already good friends and would both like to keep it that way (for myself now that I know we aren't getting together). Happy to have got a straight answer :) 

Nice to have a mature and understanding friends. 

At least you tried, thatâ€™s all that matters :) 

waa sorry for being a cold towel but it's really not easy to be "just friends" after one party has confessed to one another. There will always be this lingering tension 

Hey, I seriously suggest you cut contact with her for awhile, until the crush goes away. Depending on how long you had the crush for, it could be from a week to months. But from experience, even after being rejected, there will still be lingering feelings that will arise especially when said crush finds a boyfriend. 

At the same time, your crush would be feeling awkward from having to turn you down and hurt your feelings. I suggest giving each other some space, at least a week for these feelings to subside.
