Well the goal was already scored before the goalie contact was made, so maybe not? What's the ruling on this?  
[13.3 Illegal Puck - If at any time while play is in progress, a puck other than the one legally in play shall appear on the playing surface, the play shall not be stopped but shall continue with the legal puck until the play then in progress is completed by change of possession. ](http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2018-2019-NHL-rulebook.pdf)  
In the Hocket Canada rulebook a 2nd puck doesn't stop play until players start to play with it. If it's ignored then an official should be able to scoop it up with little to no drama.
