I'm a bit surprised by the idea that a woman would pull this immediately after having a fight, however. This seems like such a bizarre response to fighting. My initial and personal feelings were along the lines of feeling quite scripted, but if this served as a poll, I think it's safe to say the majority would not be upset. I’m a woman who uses tactics like that and initiates a lot in general, and my partners with high sex drives have all absolutely LOVED it. My one ex with a low sex drive despised it and compared it to sexual assault. As a straight dude with not the highest sex drive, I actually appreciated actions like this because it made it easier to get in the mood. He was abusive in general and knew that I’d been assaulted before, so I think he was just looking for any low blow that he could- he called me a “rapist” a few times (towards the very end of our relationship) for trying to initiate sex too much, even though I never forced him to do anything or pushed it after he rejected me. I don’t think he had a leg to stand on in calling it assault, but my point was that he very much did *not* appreciate me being forward and trying to initiate sex (he also told me that it was a turnoff and he thought there was something wrong with me). In communities with heavy emphasis on the importance of masculinity, like the US, it's expected that guys have a spontaneous sex drive and that they "don't need anything to get in the mood."
