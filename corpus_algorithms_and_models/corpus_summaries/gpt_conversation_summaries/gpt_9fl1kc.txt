The constitutional crisis is Ford using a rarely used last resort measure to bypass the courts and trample on the Charter Rights of millions of people so he can get his petty revenge on the city that rejected him and his idiot brother. You think provinces will take it well for Trudeau to supercede their legislative powers over the number of city councillors in Toronto? I always find it weird when people use the phrase "constitutional crisis" to refer to politicians using powers explicitly granted to them in the constitution. Consitutionnal crisis means that the constitution is put in question. Minor nitpick: a constitutional crisis is actually a situation that the rules of a constitution can't handle. I think it's a bad move for Trudeau to act, just like I think it was bad for ford. This has to stop at Ford, if it goes through Ford, thats on him. He was elected to meddle with Toronto's election in-progress? To attack the courts? To take away people's Charter Rights when he doesn't get his way? But then again, 54% of eligible voters voted, so I guess Ontarians are more than pleased to have Ford do as he pleases with our constitution. Well not everyone. Many people believe notwithstanding is not an emergency power and should be used regularly, while the vast majority agree that Disallowance is a last resort reserve power that should probably never be used again, like the Queen's broad theoretical authority to almost anything. He's stripping the power of the city, and cutting down council to remove those who opposed his attempts in said city council. There's plenty of things in the constitution that are not meant to be used anymore, like full royal power. Disallowance is generally also seen as a 'reserve power' like that that shouldn't be used again unless a critical emergency arises.
