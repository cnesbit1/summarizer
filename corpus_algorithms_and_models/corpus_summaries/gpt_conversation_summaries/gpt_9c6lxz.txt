I was alone at my dad's in the evening and he'd just gotten these fancy new, very very sharp Japanese knives. At around 11pm I decided to go upstairs and watch some YouTube videos in bed. My imagination completely took over and I grabbed the largest fucking Japanese knife I could find. I was the definition of stealth. I was danger. Well, that was a mistake. You know, apparently those Japanese knives are not meant to be lightly thrown in the air and then caught like a spear. I dropped the knife after feeling it slide through my flesh like butter and searched for the lights, subsequently running into the doorframe. I now have a scar on my palm of which I will never tell the story to anyone I know. I am 21 years old. I have now retired from nightly knife-wielding. Edit: I feel like I should clarify the "lightly throwing in the air" part. Do you know when you want to reposition something in your hand because it's not ideal? I kinda flicked it in the air and the end of the blade went into my hand. Edit 2: The sound was probably just the house creaking. We have wooden floors. :') There was no one at home but me.
