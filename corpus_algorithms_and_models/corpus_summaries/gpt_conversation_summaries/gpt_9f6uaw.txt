Depends on the house, if you go for a 200k house then no, but a reasonable small house at 75k on a 20 or 25 year term is definitely cheaper than renting. I recently bought a place and am paying 400$ a month vs my 900$ before. 

One thing to keep in mind is that you're not going to find a cheap place in a city to buy. You will almost always have to look outside the city for one. In more rural areas. The thing is though, we live in the age of the internet and online shopping, so living in the middle of buttfuck nowhere isn't a problem anymore. 

Keep in mind those averages you're quoting, the vast majority of houses used to calculate them are in the city to begin with. They are not good indicative of all housing markets across the country. 

If you're in a city, forget about affordable living accommodations. You'll have an abundance of jobs and all the amenities you want, but you have to sacrifice housing to get them. 

You cant have it all buddy. If you want to keep that job you sacrifice your living accommodations. If you want to own a house you might have to commute, or change jobs, or wait years till you can afford it. 

You know what I did? I said fuck it and moved to a town under an hour away. Now I commute 1.5 hours a day. 

Still depends where you live. Youâ€™re not going to find a 75K house <1 hour away from downtown Toronto. 

Considering a car is almost a necessity based on how our cities and roads are constructed and our way of life in general.
