Looks like their "finish line" was before the F16 even took off!  
F1 vs H2R makes sense but vs a F-16? That bitch is super Sonic and is gonna smoke both those bitches up.  
The F-16 is also 44 years old, at least on design.  
F16 wasn’t using afterburners, probably because they weren’t authorized for that runway. An f16 with afterburners on is basically a rocket  
It's still interesting to see that the bike beats a very fast F1, which should have amazballs acceleration! One can GUESS a jet would as well, but...well, only when in the air already AT speed!  
Stupid argument, everyone knows an f-16 is faster but it's fun to compare how fast it can get from a stand still to then end of the 1/2 mile compared to fast road vehicles. Jets take a few seconds build up thrust so they'll lose off the line and I doubt most people could guess who would win in a drag race so it's interesting to see in action.  
Jet engines also take a few to several seconds to spool up. And from the video it isn't clear if the pilot already has the engine ran up and is on the brakes, if he goes full throttle from idle it's no kidding a few seconds.  
But from a dead stop, channeling the power through physical contact is going to be much more efficient than relying purely on thrust/moving air to begin moving  
If there F-16 did a standing takeoff it would have won for sure since it just barely lost.  
They did everything they could you have the bike win. I'm not knocking the Kawasaki, I'd love to ride one, but they chose an old jet with an engine that isn't spooled up, and kept the race short enough that the other vehicles couldn't catch up, which at least a couple would have.
