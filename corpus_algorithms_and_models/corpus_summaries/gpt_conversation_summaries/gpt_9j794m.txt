I still have the jets doing something similar this trade deadline as the last. Get a rental center to play with Ehlers and Laine  
Duchene will likely go for more than Winnipeg will want to give up. A first wont be enough and I wouldnt want to give up a Vesalainen or a Niku.  
That may depend. I could see it happening if the Jets are 1st in the central by a decent bit and they look primed for another run, we'll see though, I do agree that the price on Duchene won't be cheap but the Sens would be stupid not to trade him cause with each passing day it seems less and less likely he wants to stay (See Quote about Zach Smith from yesterday)  
Totally agreed. They gotta ace this trade though. Can't blame them for biding their time and waiting for the right moment. Sucks he's on the shit end of it again though. Hopefully he ends up happy somewhere this time.  
Maybe 80’s a reach but I think Roslovic’s looked really good this preseason  
Yeah I think if he does get traded he'll go to UFA regardless just so he can make a choice of where he wants to be cause he hasn't had the greatest luck personally the past few years
