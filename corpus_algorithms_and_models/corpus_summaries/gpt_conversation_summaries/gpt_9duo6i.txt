Boxer-engine, two headlights, two horns, a VW-sidecar with also two headlights, two indicators and two windows.  
But only one pannier .. on the left  
Cargo bed on the right.  
Horns are offset, that single yellow light in the centre, single mirror  
A friend fitted air horns to his bike cos he was sick of getting cut off in the traffic. He said they werenâ€™t very effective cos when he used them, people would be frantically looking for a big semi and would totally ignore his comparatively small motorbike. *BRRRRRRRRRRRT....crunch!*  
Just like the original microbus....Your knees are the airbags  
But the bike doesn't lean anymore, you don't need a motorcycle tire.  
why not? Car tires are cheaper for longer mileage, and you don't need to lean.  
I guess it would only make sense on a bike with a sidecar.  
There's quite a dark side following in the Goldwing crowd. They'll do a car tire on the rear, and a rear MC tire on the front.  
Not much leaning to be done on highways.  
Or at all with a sidecar . . .  
I mean you *can*. On one side.  
Hell of a counterwieght you have to overcome. lol
