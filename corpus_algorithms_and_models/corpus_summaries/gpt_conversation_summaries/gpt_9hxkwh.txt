I'm a regular blood donor and i also keep fit. Went to the blood bank to drop my quarterly 500cc of blood. But that day, i got a call from work ( i drop by in my lunch break) and had to rush back. So rather than a sit down meal with lots of veggies and protein i grab a glazed donut and whatever came in a bottle to go. Immediately i felt the buzz of the sugar high. So for the rest of the day i am feeling a little light headed ( slightly normal after I donate), but also slightly nauseous and a little on edge. Now, i pause here to add that after donating blood, i am usually advised to not do vigorous exercise lift weights for 48-72 hrs. Now i have broken all the rules, am dehydrated, experience hyperglycaemia and i'm pushing my blood and heart to do some serious cardio. I of course don't remem ber any of this but i wake up in the ER with a drip and a very cross wife with puke stained hair staring at me. Doctor says i should be fine but not try whatever it is i did  after donating blood. Apparently if I wasn't qyite so healthy, the self induced hyperglycemia  could have resulted in a coma or possible blown blood vessel somewhere like my brain. We told the doctor i was "working out", and he just nodded. He thinks its a confluence  of too much sugary stuff ( i didnt eat that much proper food that day), fatigue (i hadnt been sleeping much coz of work), dehydration, and the blood loss.
