I'm most sad about the kid sitting next to her who had to witness some complete shitface of a motorcyclist go off at his mom like that.  
I will never, ever in my life understand what compels these morons to upload videos of themselves doing 100+ on public roads. Every other part of this discussion aside, you have to be either monumentally stupid or an unhinged narcissist or both to think that's a good idea.  
I do my share of things I probably shouldn't on the road, but being a confrontational asshole like this after blatantly passing on double yellows just reflects poorly on all of us. And to a mother with her child in the car to boot.  
People like that don't get embarrassed because they always think they're better than anyone else.  
If you don't learn a lesson after hitting a fence post on a road with no turns, I really doubt any other accident will.  
The wreck that birthed the Yellow Porsche thing went like this. The Yam and his buddies were out for a spirited ride. Yam made the shit-tier decision to cut the blind corner and cross on a double yellow line. He happened to meet the Porsche in the turn at a rather high rate of speed head on. Keep in mind the car is also going the other direction so in total there was a ton of force in the wreck.  
The Porsche's crumple zones did their job and kept the driver relatively safe. Yammi however was launched into the sky like a god damned rocket ship. Went down really hard. He lost a lot of function in his arm, along with a bunch of other shit that comes with wrecking a car head on on a motorcycle.
