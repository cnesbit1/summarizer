I am tempted to have sex with a family friend because I sense from texts he is interested in me in that way. I have sex anxiety. I'm worried of we bang it would ruin the dynamic of things. He knows and talks to my dad and my whole family. Doesn't he care that this could be awkward? I wish I didn't think so much and could have sex with him without thinking of all the repercussions. If he wanted you romantically, he would make that very clear and you wouldn't be on here asking what to do. Just because someone is interested in having sex with you, it doesn't mean they are into you as a person. You deserve more than that. I wish I were the type to do sex with a hot guy and not care. I'm not like that though. I would like him and he would have to peel me away from him. It seems rare to meet a guy with the right intentions. Please believe me when I say that there are guys out there with the right intentions.
