Michael Avenatti tweeeted that his new client is not Deborah Ramirez which is the woman you are referring to.  
His new client is another woman that has made an accusation against Kavanaugh.  
Ronan Farrow: “it is not accurate to say that those who knew [Kavanaugh] at the time dispute" that the allegation is credible”  
Until the hearing or an investigation, there’s no basis to claim this is a smear other than your feelings being hurt.  
The very witnesses she claims was there have ALL come forth to say she's lying or mistaken.  
Sure, Judge also refuses to testify and Farrow has witnesses supporting Ramirez. All of this could be cleared up by an investigation, yet Republicans don’t want one. If he’s innocent, why not?  
You don't open an investigation with simple allegations. **Especially** when there's more evidence proving his innocence than there is his guilt.  
Dems want an investigation that will take months. Conveniently stalling until after midterms where they can resist.  
The picture is literally a screenshot of the FBI's own words. Now you're being petty.  
The only facts that have come out disprove this nonsense.  
The very witnesses that the accuser said was at the party says it never happened.  
1. he's innocent until proven guilty. Someones word isn't not proof. Especially when you factor in the fact that she has participated in antitrump marches. Her social media accts were a shitfest full of antitrump rhetoric which she deleted. Even her lawyer participated in Antifa riots/protest while wearing a black power shirt. They're both obviously bias and have it out for trump.  
2. there's proof that she's lying. Like eyewitnesses.  
It's almost as if an investigation is in order to figure it out.
