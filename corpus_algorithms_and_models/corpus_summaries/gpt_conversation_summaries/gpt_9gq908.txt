You're generalizing WAY to much. Your penis is not the relationship. Your virginity isnt the relatiionship. If youre a decent person, and treat woman as people and not objects, eventually it'll happen. But if you keep this attitude, people will smell it on you, and avoid you because your bad news. Jesus christ man, you need to talk to a therapist. Stop worrying about whether or not other people will love you and work on getting yourself there first. It sounds like you have been reading incel propaganda. It is a SCAM. First thing to do is extricate yourself from that. It may feel like it's making you stronger but it is destroying you. I've heard as many men using dick size as a marker for masculinity as women, so I'm not sure women are as obsessed with it as you think they are. I mean, yeah, some women make fun of small dicks the same way some guys make fun of roast beef curtain vaginas. They're called assholes. They should be ignored by everyone. I don't know man, I'm 40, I'm fat, I didn't have sex between the ages of 23 and 39, I kinda gave up, then I met someone nice on the internet. Also, before this one, the last guy I was head over heels painfully in love with, for like a year, was a 28 year old virgin who rejected ME. For a girl he met online, who he is now married to. Virginity certainly is not a dealbreaker for me and I can't be the only one.
