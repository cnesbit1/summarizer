I just sold my bike a couple months back. I was never riding it other than going to the beach, which didn't justify the money I would start having to put into it. Only accidents I've had in 3 years of riding in NYC were from bumping someones rear end after someone in a land Rover blitzed down the bicycle lane doing 40 (had to get over a few feet FAST), and dumping the bike once at slow speed when an older pedestrian walked right out in front of me. Learned to ride in Mexico City. Yup, big city mad traffic does wonders on your reaction times for pretty much all scenarios. I can now mentally calculate the exact distance required for a full stop at most speeds. I mean, anyone for sure will do that, the guy was clearly distracted and out of anywhere his visors gets punched off. The moral of the TIFU isn’t that you can’t ride your bike to work, it’s that you’re a fucking asshole who road rages. Regardless of what he did or didn’t pay attention to biker punching off mirrors is some dumbass shit and you need to check your ego and anger bro. I've been in two accidents because of someone texting and driving. If I could have, I would have happily torn off their mirror to being their attention back to the fucking road before they kill someone. You say childish shit, but guaranteed they're now paying attention to driving instead of their phone.
