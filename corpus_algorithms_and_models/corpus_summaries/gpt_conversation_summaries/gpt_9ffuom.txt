For new parents (the trend I see among my friends) they lose their identity the moment they get their first child. It is still important to allocate some time for yourself to do hobbies you like. A happy parent raises happy kids. The one thing I really miss is having zero interruptions during all my free time, to play games, watch movies etc. Now I have to plan my time carefully to get these few hours of "me time" here and there. If not I become very irritable and not fun to be around with. When I'm happy every interaction with my family is better. Feeling guilty about treatment of your kids (and about other things in life too, really) is something that is deeply rooted in our upbringing and childhood. Typically, you need to first examine and identify the source of that guilt you feel as well as related self beliefs, then take steps to convince yourself and rewire your emotional cues. Therapy and similar services can help as can some books (pm if interested) I have hired a helper at home to help with laundry and my son when we are not at home, so it's much easier for us. I have observed that most of the parents in the "lose your identity" group don't do it by choice. I really need a helper though because I only have my mother (single parent) who is still working, and my wife's parents are overseas. I love my uninterrupted RPG sessions :( guess I need to get my fill of that.
