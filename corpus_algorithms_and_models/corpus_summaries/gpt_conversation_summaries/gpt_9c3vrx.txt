A lot of people have no clue how easily America can ruin Canada's economy. They are after all, the biggest economy in the world. Abrogation of NAFTA would hurt our economy but by no means would it "wreck" it. NAFTA withdraw and auto tariffs combined with steel tariffs (not to mention the recent pipeline fiasco) would cause foreign investment to dry up. Although I don't pretend that exports would thrive in the immediate termination of NAFTA, the supply chains and export markets underlying NAFTA would not go away simply because NAFTA might end (e.g. look at the complex and integrated supply chain for the Ontario-made Toyota Rav4, the most popular non-truck in America in order to see what I mean). Canada is a resource based economy that primarily exports to the US. Canada is highly dependent on the US to refine 75% of its oil and gas exports. The TPP is a pan-Asian trade agreement - of course it is going to increase trade in Asian-based/produced goods. This is a good thing for Canada, as the less reliance that they place on U.S. markets will only increase overall trade stability. Signing a trade deal from a position of weakness is not a good idea. I would rather pay more for everything than sign a bad deal. Appeasement is not how you handle aggressive countries. This has always been the case. Not signing the deal would be an opportunity for Canada to steal American intellectual property for free like China and get even cheaper drugs manufactured in Canada. Canada has ammunition to hurt America more than they would hurt us over the long-term.
