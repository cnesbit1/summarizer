Extremely good top end talent and very good depth. It's honestly really hard having to choose between some players. You know a draft was fucking ridiculous when the consensus is that a guy like Marner moves back 3-4 spots. I agree, and when you have Connor, who scored over 30 goals his rookie year not in the top 10 (which I agree with) That's typically what you look for when you're drafting. That being said, there aren't that many players like that in each draft and they usually go top 10. And the Oilers traded a mid-1st round pick in this draft for a guy who was sliding down the farm club's depth chart. I disagree with it. What has Chabot or Hanifin done to prove more valuable than Connor heading into the 2018-19 season? I think a top pair defensemen is a top 30~ defensemen in the NHL and a number 1 is a top 10~ defensemen.
