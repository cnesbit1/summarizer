I'm still trying to find where I fit and it feels like no church will ever align with 100% of my beliefs.  
That's a whole lot of 'If the Church doesn't have authority to declare those things then why even be Catholic?'  
Because I don't know for sure, I don't claim to know everything, this is the Church I was raised in, taught to believe is always right and the only available here.  
I just don't accept everything without asking questions. There are no other denominations around.  
'I know based on that list what you don't know and it comes down to some pretty basics of the faith.'  
Taking aside for a moment that how you feel about something doesn't make it true of false.  
If you can establish both of those it really takes a reflection of Catholic belief throughout Scripture and then affirming it throughout the oral tradition to be convincing intellectually.  
But they divorce them from Sacred Tradition.  
God didn't drop the Bible at of the sky... It came about through the Church by the power of God.  
Having doubts doesn't preclude someone from membership in the Church but it does present some issues with presenting oneself for the Sacraments.  
The Church is big enough for your doubts, she can handle your questions.  
They are incredibly important!  
If you know the root of your doubts it might be relevant to start there.
