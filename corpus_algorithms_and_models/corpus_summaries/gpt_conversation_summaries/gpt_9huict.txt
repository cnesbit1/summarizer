Backstory: I applied for a summer internship at Uber in San Francisco with an idea to help them save on driver incentive costs. However, I was not given the opportunity to work there and yet my idea had been adopted and implemented in Singapore. On hindsight, I realized how my idea infringed on the foundation of meritocracy (work hard and be rewarded)

With ride-hailing apps such as Tada, Filo, Ryde and GoJek emerging to compete for a slice of the pie after Uber's exit, consumers would once again enjoy discounts and promotions when these ride-hailing apps start to compete with each other to gain ground on market share. However, we must not overlook the role drivers play in capturing market share for these companies in the "taxi" industry, therefore we can conclude that these ride-hailing companies would eventually roll out driver incentives to attract drivers to join their ranks. Example: Uber used to dish out incentives weekly for a certain number of trips clocked.

This goes against the foundation of meritocracy because Driver A has been working hard (putting in hours) yet the ride went to driver B.

With this opinion, I hope that the government would start an initiative to prevent these companies from designing their codes in a way that will infringe on the foundation of meritocracy, or even limit the use of such algorithms before drivers hit their incentives.

This has nothing to do with meritocracy. And meritocracy is not "work hard and be rewarded".

And it's just not that interesting an idea or opinion to publish in the Forum section.

It doesn’t just work in the one hour. It’s working every minute to artificially suppress the number of rides clocked by every driver.

Meritocracy is not about effort, it's about one's ability to bring value to his organization.

If you know anything about Uber’s algorithms and the way they run the company, you would know they wouldn’t care about something like this.

You mentioned that "my idea had been adopted and implemented" and followed by "I don't have proof". It awfully seems like you're jumping to conclusions too early.
