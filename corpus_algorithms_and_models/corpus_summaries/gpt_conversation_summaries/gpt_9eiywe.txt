I drive a 2007 Yamaha YZF600R Thundercat.  
Jumping it with a car turned off shouldn't have fried it. But it could be something else that was already going bad.  
What I would do is put the battery on a trickle charger (use the slowest charge you can) and charge it back to full capacity. Get a multimeter and set it to VDC. Start the bike up and take a voltage reading across the battery terminals.  
If it's reading low then likely something in the charging system (usually stator) is shot. If it's reading high I would start with the voltage regulator/rectifier.  
If everything tests good and you fully charged the battery on a trickle charger then the next steps would be damaged wiring or possibly a battery that is so damaged it cannot hold a charge.  
Bikes don’t have alternators, they have stators. Stators, especially on older bikes, aren’t nearly as powerful as automotive alternators.  
Battery Tenders (made by Deltran) are not trickle chargers. They monitor the battery’s charge and cycle themselves off and on - idiot proof. A trickle charger gives zero shits about the battery’s status and pumps amps in ‘til you turn it off.  
And motorcycle electrical systems aren't as powerful as those on cars because they're so much smaller than cars!
