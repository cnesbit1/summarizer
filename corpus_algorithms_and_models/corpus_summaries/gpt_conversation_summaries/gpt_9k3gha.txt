Price is a tough one since the question is about right now and last season was bad and the season before that he missed most of it with injury. Definitely good goalie but it’s been a couple seasons since he’s been able to show it

Interesting list. Didn’t expect to see Gibson so high but he is one of the best goalies in the NHL. Luongo over Fleury shocked me tho lol I expected MAF to be higher. How much would your list change if Vasy and Hellebyuck had years like last seasons?

I totally forgot about hellebyuk he'd rank at 8-10 range

IMO, Rask shouldn’t even be on this list. Fleury should be higher. Maybe switch Price and Bob.

Price isn't even top 5 at the moment

Rask is 10000000% in the top 10.

If you dig a little deeper Rask has some pretty questionable numbers. He is pretty well insulated in Boston. His expected save percentage is not great. For example his comparable last year was Scott Darling.

The man has only had one good season as a starter. He was really good last season, but there are other, more established goalies with better bodies of work that I think you have to put ahead of him.

Vasilevskiy has at least had two consecutive quality seasons as a starter, though I do agree he might be a bit high at #6.

I agree but I wouldn't have Luongo. Quick should replace him

Nice to see a list not based on recency bias. Can't believe people are leaving price out competely
