He's in an interesting situation right now, where he could play in Ottawa, the AHL, or London.  
He came from the NCAA, so that rule doesn't apply. If he went to the CHL, then he wouldn't be able to be called up again.  
Only if they came through the CHL. He didn't. His rights are owned by London should he choose that route but right now he's free from that.  
He was drafted out of the NCAA, not the CHL  
Thats only for people who have came from the chl. Brady was drafted out of college, and never played in the chl, so he can play with any team he wants  
My guess would be at least 9 games in the NHL. You don't give a guy a number 7 to send him to juniors.
