For a population of 5 million, a sample size of 750 and 4000 individuals would give you a 95% confidence level with a 3.58% and 1.55% margin of error.

More importantly, the 55% number is pretty heartening even if not ideal, especially when you consider the survey also shows an increasing trend of acceptance for the LGBT community.

Now, if we want the industry standard 95% confidence level, as well as a 4% margin of error, a sample of 600 is enough to be considered 'representative' actually.

Look at the US, France, Spain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Italy for counter-examples.

As of 2018, same-sex marriage is performed and recognized by law (nationwide or in some parts) in the following countries: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico,[a] the Netherlands,[b] New Zealand,[c] Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom,[d] the United States,[e] and Uruguay.

I sat for a lecture once about this and there is research to indicate that when homosexuality is outlawed, gay people tend to have a marriage for show and have kids which contributes to the population as opposed to states where homosexuality is accepted.

I don't think anyone can say right now what is the "correct" way to deal with LGBT as a state.

The government is probably stalling/waiting on the long-term effects by using other states as a case-study to see what happens.

According to the UN, there is an economic cost to the society when LGBTs are discriminated against: https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-real-cost-of-lgbt-discrimination/
