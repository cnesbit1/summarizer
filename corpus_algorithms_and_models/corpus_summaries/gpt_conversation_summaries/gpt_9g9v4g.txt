Thank you, we are often so blinded in the West to not even realize these things are going on. I want to be a missionary to the Middle East, please pray for the courage to do so, even with autism/ptsd. Keep in mine there is a large presence of Christian's there. The Orthodox and catholic churches need support, so If you go, support them and their efforts. I just wnat to study the Bible and serve people around others who LOVE God. I have disability but I'm in a room alone 24/7, I don't know any humans in person. You said a day or so ago that you worship God alone, and that’s good practice, but you commented it on a thread of an icon of St Nicholas. This implies a belief that Catholics/Orthodox worship saints and idols, which is far from true. We believe that they are not dead, but alive in Christ. They are in a sense more alive that us, since in heaven they are without sin. As they are alive, we ask them to pray for us to God. Everything is directed at God. The saints magnify the glory of God by being examples in life of His Grace and His power. In the Epistle of Saint James it’s shown that the prayer of a righteous man availeth much, and who could be more righteous than the people in heaven? There are even special words for the distinction between their treatment and God’s. Saints receive *dulia*, meaning veneration, whereas God receives *latria*, meaning worship. Thank you so much for that helpful information. I might disagree with some things, but I want us to be united in Christ for sure.
