If the Liberals can't form a government, the PC's will be allowed to try to form a government. I can't imagine the PA supporting the Liberals, and who knows what the Greens will do, so the PC's and the party of **anti-bilingual populists** will most likely join up to form a government in a couple of weeks. Just a point of clarification: in NB we have 2 seperate healthcare systems, as well as French and English children not being permitted to use the same busses. Bathurst already does this with their hospital so I don’t see why this would be such a big deal. It just makes good sense to have one bilingual institution to lower costs and increase communication (hopefully - as I’ve heard the relations between the two authorities are terrible). You’d be shocked how many pissy parents in this province support this. Their identity is wrapped up in the fucking language they prefer. I peeked at the electoral map, and holy shit the red areas are predominantly French (northern NB and Shediac-Mirimichi) while the blue are predominantly English (Moncton-Saint John-Fredericton), with some exceptions here and there. Anti-bilingualism also has been popular in NB because of the drain on the system (segregation of busses, schools, services) and what a lot of people view it as well as loss of opportunity in the workforce here mainly if you live in the southern anglo dominant parts since everything still requires french for promotion or good paying jobs (why kids leave NB for NS etc.) - mainly due to this poor two educational systems in play for over 60 years yet our kids are getting less and less bilingual per generation (currently I believe a shrinking 17%). There's a saying in Federal elections that involves NB: "Whichever way NB goes, the country goes." This is becuase we have such a divided population in: - English-French - Rural-Urban - Rich-Middle Class-Poor And that saying was very prevalent in yesterdays election. The English voted for the predominantly english party (PC) The french voted for the predominantly french party (LIB) The (mostly) rural english voters voted for the anti-french party (PA) They're not anti-French, they're looking to do away with "duality", namely dual-busing of students and the two separate health authorities.
