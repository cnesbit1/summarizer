One time, my family and I had just returned from Japan and we needed a big cab to load up all our baggage. On top that, he was extremely rude. Plus, he started arguing with the neighbouring taxi Drivers and he airport Marshalls promptly told him to leave, which he did. Luckily another MPV taxi turned up, and the driver his round was SUPER friendly. Taxis queuing at airport hates Tampines Pasir Ris Simei. Cos they queued for hours on end and get a paltry fare. I used to give the ones who don't make noise $3 to $4 on top of the fare. yes hours - especially if you noobie go into the queue at dead hours like 2am - you can be there till 4:30am when the next flight comes in - and there is no backing out once you are there .... you are locked inside the queue....
