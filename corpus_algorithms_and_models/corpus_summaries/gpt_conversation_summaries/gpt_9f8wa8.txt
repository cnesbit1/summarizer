Maybe he can do both? In a healthy relationship, one partner's health shouldn't be completely ignored in favor of the other's. I think OP should start seeing a therapist to deal with this (because that could have been a fairly shocking and deeply uncomfortable experience with nasty results), alongside whatever they do as a couple to get over that issue.

He's not pulling a "poor me." He could very well be in a lot of emotional turmoil and pain, and posting about it on reddit, on a hub for people who've made mistakes that they continued to regret, may not be such a terrible idea. Granted, Reddit isn't therapy, but getting shit out and off your chest can really help some people.

He’s in such turmoil because he’s been faced with a reality he’s hidden from himself- the fact that she has a sexual life before their relationship.

No, it’s more that he now knows for absolute certain that she did do with someone else something that he fantasises about, but she refused to do with him.

I can see how that would sting
