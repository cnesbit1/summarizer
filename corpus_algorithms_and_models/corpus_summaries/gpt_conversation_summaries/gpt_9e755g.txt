Brock Nelson would be a good 1for1 imho  
Nah, it'd be Andrew Ladd. You need someone who has shown that they can win the whole thing  
Chia would want Boychuk back.  
Those Cup rings carry lots of value!  
Boychuk and Ladd for McDavid, salaries should work  
Back off buster, it's someone else's turn  
We'll offer them, uhh...Polak is gone so...Zaitsev. 1 for 1. Ok we'll give you a 4th as well. Even better deal than Hall.  
Somewhere Ray Sheroâ€™s ears are twitching in delight hearing one for one.  
did someone say Willy Nilly? McDavid-Nylander trade incoming  
You and the Devils already had your turns! Give someone else in the division a chance to trade with Chia!  
Well fuck, maybe Shero should ask Chiarelli for a trade now.  
Well the last time they did it they won a Stanley Cup. Seems like a solid plan to me  
if buffalo got mcdavid, eichel would ask for a trade
