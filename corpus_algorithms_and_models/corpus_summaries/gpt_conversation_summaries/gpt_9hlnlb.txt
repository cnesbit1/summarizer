For a free market to function competition needs to exist.  
But doesn't an unregulated free market inevitably lead to monopolies?  
Yes. Hence the game Monopoly  
Regulations don't prevent monopolies. If they did, Canada would have concepts of choice.  
Not really. If a company is approaching monopoly status, and raising prices to take advantage of that, it increases the incentive for other parties to enter the market.  
You're more likely to end up with a stable system with a few large actors, that collude to their mutual benefit, than you are to see an actual monopoly.  
That's actually incorrect. There are stable and unstable Monopoly equilibria. Ticketmaster is a good example of a stable monopolistic equilibrium.  
Therefore it is not in the economic interests of any single entity to change, even though a more efficient system can exist.  
Well one would be that they are allowed to use anticompetitive practices to ensure their monopoly. Venues either use TM for all their events or they get none of them.  
Actually it is supposed to be, hence the privilege that is propping TicketMaster up.  
The problem is that governments are not enforcing laws such as this in some sectors (eg. TicketMaster, cell phones in Canada) so the normal economic activity that would allow competition is stifled, prices go up, consumers get hurt.  
This is an incredibly poor understanding of economics. When an entity is large enough they are able to engage in practices that discourage competition.
