&gt; But Catholic priest and lecturer in canon law at the Catholic Theological College Professor Ian Waters said priests would be unlikely to break the seal.

&gt; "If a policeman came to me or to another priest and said, 'Did Bill Smith come and confess this sin?', I don't believe a priest would break the seal," he said.

I think polarizing is the word you're looking for. Devout Catholics will really dig in and lukewarm Catholics will be turned off.

Protecting men who sexually abuse children is seen as a much more serious issue, that is more likely to make people actually leave the church

We should base laws on what protects children's lives, not on what offends someone's religious sensibilities.

Its not just between the seal and protecting their image, more importantly its between the seal and protecting innocent people's lives.

It is unclear to me that this would protect children's lives. It seems like it would just result in the crimes not being confessed, rather than resulting in more molesters being caught.

Mandatory reporters have saved countless lives in the past. Why should priests be held to a lower standard?

The thing I worry about is that instituting mandated reporting for priests in the confessional could result in fewer opportunities to actually counsel people who are doing these things, and that that counseling may currently have a positive impact on the number of people who stop. If that is the case, it would effectively be accepting an *increase* in the amount of abuse in order to avoid the discomfort of someone knowing about it but not being able to share.

Talking with a priest does not make people less likely to absue, especially when the priest is willing to cover up abuse that occurs.

People confess crimes to the Police all the time. Arguing this law is pointless as people wont confess is just not correct. People will still confess crimes to priest after mandatory reporting is introduced.

That's just not good enough and you know it. If you abuse children you should go to jail. Not be moved to another position within the Church.

The Catholic church has hidden child abusers for decades. You don't get to use the persecution card.
