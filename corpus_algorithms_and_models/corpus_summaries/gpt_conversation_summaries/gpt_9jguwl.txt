Chances are you can plug it, but as someone who’s seen plugs fail, I’ve always cautioned my friends that if you damage a tire in any way, they are cheap enough to just replace with new.  
Plugs are perfectly fine if it's in the tread and not the sidewall. It's not any more of a risk than the risk that you'll run over a piece of shrapnel (like a nail maybe?) and have it puncture your tire.  
Even at $200 it’s cheaper than piece of mind and a hospital bill.  
It's also cheaper than buying a yacht, but neither yachts nor hospital bills are fair comparisons to be made here.  
Let's stop spreading this FUD please, it's just unfounded paranoia.  
If I had a tire punctuated I replace the tire, especially with the speeds I tend to ride at.  
I just like the positive riding karma, even if a plug would be fine 99.9999% of the time.  
Not if it’s a sport bike. Plugs are safe up to 55 mph. I would never plug a z rated tire. Just isn’t safe.  
I’ll plug anything long enough to get to the shop.  
I buy it at my dealership - about $30 a tire. Free replacement 3 weeks ago when I caught a staple in my new Road 5 with less than 1000 miles.  
You are free to take whatever risks you find acceptable when you ride. I try to minimize the risks that I can control. I would never repair a Z rated tire.
