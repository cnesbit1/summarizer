Obviously not. A senpai is an older classmate/someone who is elder in your company or organization without being manager.

A sempi is, apparently, someone you love so much that you want them so badly and you would do anything for them to notice you and if you really love your sempi you will kill girls who talk or look at them and you might kill sempi to be with them forever.

Because in the Corps, they teach Marines the value of honor, discipline, and loving sempai so much that you have to kill all of America's enemies to keep sempai safe.

Dude went straight for the murder talk.

Is it a dude? I got the impression it was a girl/woman when they said they would kill all girls who talk to their sempi. Either way, time to run.

It's the type of character that seems cutesy and lovestruck right up until the object of their affection either doesn't acknowledge them or gets involved or admired by someone else, at which point they turn completely psychotic.

That's what the majority of 12 year old girls who just learned about the word senpai derive all their information from.
