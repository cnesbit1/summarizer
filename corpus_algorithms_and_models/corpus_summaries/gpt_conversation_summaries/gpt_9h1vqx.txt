I mean technically yes but often the first time hurts and you would not want him being so aggressive immediately. The wrong angle or too much depth can definitely cause pain. I would just for your own safety start slow and if you feel okay then he can increase the pace. 

Not necessarily. I’ve had regular sex for 10 years and it can still hurt me just depending on how it’s done. Was actually in pain for hours last time I had sex because of a particular angle and very hard and fast thrusting. Being your first time you don’t want any more pain than is necessary. That’s why I say start slow and work your way up. There is no need to rush right into hard fucking. 

I can’t tell you what it’s going to feel like only what it *could* feel like. I don’t know your vagina or his penis. It may not hurt at all. You could have a deep vagina or he could have a smaller penis. Or you could be the perfect fit and there is no issue. It’s just better to err on the side of caution until you know what you can handle. 

Then yeah I’d recommend going slow and have lube on hand in case you do not get wet enough or start to dry out. Make sure to have plenty of foreplay. Proper arousal allows the vagina to open up more which can help mitigate pain. 

If there is, tell him to stop. You can absolutely stop it if you feel pain or are uncomfortable. Please don’t be afraid to do so. You have no obligation to continue if it hurts.
