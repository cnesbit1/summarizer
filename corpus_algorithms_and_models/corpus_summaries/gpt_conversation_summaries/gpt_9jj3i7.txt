I been havin this nightmare about this chapter for about half a year now. The details in the dream vary but it always has the same general plot. Im a Hebrew warrior in Moses's army. We are marching to the city of the Midianites. All I know is that I'm here to fight, nothing more.

Moses pats me on the shoulder and I learn that apparently I'm a captain or some shit. He gives me his scimitar and says, "I'll let you have the honors of first kill.'' At first I didn't have a clue what he meant, but then he starts gesturing towards the women and children.

Finally I got my shit together, even then I could barely speak without havin to pause cuz of the knot in my throat. I told him I can't do it, and he said he was very disappointed in me. He sat down and covered his face with his hands for a minute or so.

I started crying uncontrollably, a grown ass man like me bawlin. I turned my head cuz that baby was still movin even after he had hit the sharp rocks. He was still jerkin and I turned away, sunk to my knees, and cried. That's normally how the dream ends, and it's not the only type of dream I have about this sort of thing.

But my dream is based off of biblical history. Read numbers 31. Moses really did do this.

Before this dream I tried to tell myself, *God did it for the better*, or *they deserved it*. But how is one gonna free people who were in slavery and had their babies killed by Egyptians, only to order them to kill babies and enslave people? Hypocritical if you ask me.

The Hebrews weren't no different than the Egyptians. It matters not who commits the action, only the action itself matters. Think about it, if our African/European ancestors determined the morality of an action based on who does it, a criminal strangling a baby would've been called a crime, but a man of ''god'' doing the very same action would be called ''righteous''.

God doesn't operate on deserve or not deserve. He operates on whatever His plans are.

There is a trend when nations do things God hates. Specifically as it pertains to Midian, they were a nation of the LORD and they did not live accordingly.

...avenge the LORD of Midian. Numbers:31:3

Vex the Midianites, and smite them: Numbers:25:17

Don't forget about the
