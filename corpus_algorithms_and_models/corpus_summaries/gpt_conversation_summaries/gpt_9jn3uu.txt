I understand having a dress code for work. I think if someone wants to be nude that’s fine too, I’m not a nudist myself. But this sounds like victim blaming. Like “ what was she wearing?!” Like anyone other than the rapist is to blame. They aren’t. Rapists cause 100% of rape, not tank tops. 

He’s saying that because we all know this and have all relatively accepted it, that’s why we all have generally agreed that certain clothes are more professional than the others. Clothes enhance and minimize your sexuality, that’s a fact. If I wore a tight shirt, you bet your ass that might make me appear more sexy than if I wore a baggy shirt that didn’t compliment my shape. 

Rape isn’t a crime that’s based on attraction, not all forms of it at least. Rape usually is an expression of power dynamics. Rapists don’t care usually how you are dressed, they care whether or not you are a weak and easy target. Women should not be demonized because of the clothes they choose to wear just as men shouldn’t be demonized for being attracted and distracted by the beauty of women. 

Little girls, women, and old grandmas get raped all around the world, even if they are wearing the most old, dirty, unattractive clothes. You know why? Because men are pieces of shit that justify themselves by thinking they can't control their "urges" like you just did in that garbage you wrote. 

First of all, no RATIONAL man has urges they can’t control. And once again, it goes over your head. Read my post again, it says that it’s MANAGEABLE, I didn’t say that it’s UNCONTROLLED. I get that this is an important and sensitive topic, but to say that Men getting distracted by things that are attractive to them is bad and men should feel bad for having these urges, then you are preaching an unhealthy concept. 

The problem is that you use this argument to support the idea that if women would dress in a certain way, it will eliminate the distraction. That is false. Attractive women will always be a distraction even if they will dress modestly. If i know something about male sexuality, is that men have a wild imagination. It is often enough just to see a women's shape to become distracted and start fantasising about sex. It happens to me all the time. Last time it was a woman in a turtle neck and dress pants.
