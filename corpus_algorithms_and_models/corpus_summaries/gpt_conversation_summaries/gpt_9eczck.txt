“I do believe him,” Colorado forward Nathan MacKinnon told The Athletic. “I don’t think he was fucking injecting a needle in his ass. We’re all hockey players. We all respect the game. I’m sure Nate Schmidt isn’t a cheater. I believe him. I don’t think he intentionally did anything.  

He’s already a great defenseman, likely the best on his team. With the individual skill of a player being less impactful in hockey compared to other sports it makes no sense to do this, because it’s unlikely that people will notice a minor change in performance.  

Stats are more important than ever come contract negotiation time. Every single thing is under the microscope. Both the players agent and the team use stats to evaluate individual performances.  

Man I love the sense of comradery you get from hearing Nate say that.  

They're all in this together despite being fierce on-ice opponents.  

They do really have respect for each other. Except the ones that lick people.  

The whole team had a statistical leap. Look at William Karlsson's stats before last season.  

Also steroids don't just make people stronger. There's a lot of effects and they can vary from drugs, but one thing they generally do is allow for longer and more intense training than your body could normally handle.  

Just because Nathan MacKinnon believes Schmidt does not mean Schmidt is innocent.  

Yeah Barry Bonds was a definite slouch before he began PED use. Saying good players have no reason to cheat is ridiculous. It’s hard getting to the top and even harder staying there.
