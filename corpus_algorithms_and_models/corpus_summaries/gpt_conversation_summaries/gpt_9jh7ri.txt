Are you the woman who goes on multiple dates with multiple men on multiple dating sites?  
hahaha okay that's pretty funny!! I hope you're happy and find the Mr/s who buys you roses and milk tea!!  
Anyone know a good gift for someone who's about to start her adventure into the full-time working world?  
cant go wrong with an anduril replica  
engraved wine bottle, etc?  
A Michael Kors bag/ a pair of Melissa flats/ Coach lanyard so she will look like the rest of the OLs  
Interesting. With wine inside? She doesnt drink much, nor like wine.  
A lot of sweets to snack on or breath mints to keep awake and fresh for meetings  
Water bottle or thermal flask  
nice! she already has a good thermal flash so i think i'll go with other items. but i def need one LOL
