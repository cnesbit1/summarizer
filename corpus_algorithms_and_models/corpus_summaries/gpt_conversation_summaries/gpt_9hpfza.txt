I feel it is the right thing to do and the right course for me in terms of what I want to do for a living. Sounds remarkably like what I'm going to end up. I'm 25 now and more than likely will be expelled from uni pretty soon. Surprising how uncanny this is similar to my situation. And I'm scared af. Don't worry, you can redeem yourself in Poly. That's what I plan to do. Consistent but horrible result due to reasons. More of still having to pay my school fees despite being expelled, which is like nearly 30k now.
