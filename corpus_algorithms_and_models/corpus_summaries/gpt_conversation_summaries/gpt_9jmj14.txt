We ended up breaking up (not necessarily over this, but kinda - he ended up coming out as aro-ace; he had an all-encompassing fetish for enormous fake boob women and never really wanted to be in a relationship in the first place, which kinda fucked with me), and this is just one of those things which just really got stuck in my head I'm having a little trouble shaking..

ETA - Please *please* don't hate on women who have had surgery in the comments. Opinions are cool but no mean stuff please. I appreciate reassurance on my bf's comment but don't want any nasty or insulting stuff said about women who have had boob jobs. &lt;3

**ETA - Stop insulting women with breast implants (or any other superficial reason),** ***please***. It's really mean and not helpful.

I'm bi and also love boobs, but I'm not into fake boobs at all myself, and I thought some guys felt that way too (nothing personal at all against women who have had surgery), but the idea that ALL men have *one* preference this way absolutely floored me.

Some people HATE fake boobs. Some people absolutely love them. I happen to think there is no such thing as fake boobs, because if you can lick them and touch them, then they are real.

Bottom line is its a spectrum. And there is someone, somewhere on every single point within it. I wouldnt sweat any one person's preference.

I also should mention that I dont have anything against people with fake boobs either. It's just not an aesthetic preference. If it makes them happy, they should go for it.

No, many of us guys share your preference.

I'd rather have a girl with smaller nicely-shaped boobs, than giant ones that look like the doc tried to shove a couple volleyballs under her skin.

But yeah, I like a natural look most, and I've talked to a lot of guys who agree. But there's also no such thing as universal preference, when it comes to sex. Highly common, perhaps, but definitely not universal...

I just like boobs.

If I can touch them, they’re real.

Although I like natural better than fake, I love ALL boobs when they’re bouncing in my face.

In the opposite. I love them all when in my face, but I prefer them fake.

Depends on what they are attached to.
