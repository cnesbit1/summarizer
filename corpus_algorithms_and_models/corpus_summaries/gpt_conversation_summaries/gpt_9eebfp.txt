There is no greater win for Mr.Trump than to have **EVERY** auto manufacturing job to move from Canada back to the American *Rust Belt*, unfortunately, the virtue signalling gender-balanced cabinet can't explain that to JR. The Sycophantic media is not doing their job and ringing **ALARM BELLS** over the pending trap (1/7 of Canadian jobs are tied to the auto industry) Those are scary figures. Maybe we should diversify our economy. we are, into a diversified culture where the CeeBeeZee is larger than all other media outlets... combined I like most aspects of the CBC and I believe having it benefits the country. Why am I forced to pay for your entertainment? You are not forced to pay for mine... That's a pretty selfish assessment. There are government services that my tax dollars pay for that I do not use. We do it to create a better society for all Canadians. I would prefer rather than the Billion spent entertaining you be spent on the Homeless Canadians and our Veterans... but that is pretty selfish of me to get between you and your CeeBeeZee We are too dumb and stupid to do so. We need larger ports to export our goods to other trading partner s and the goods that other countries want to buy from us is unfortunately precious metals, agriculture and raw materials. But we are too restrictive. CN would need to double rail capacity and twin new lines just to meet the needs of agriculture alone.
