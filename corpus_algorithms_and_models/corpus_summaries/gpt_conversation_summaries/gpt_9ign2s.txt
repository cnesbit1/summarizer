It’s actually a pretty common phrase in the Northern parts of America, I use it all too frequently and am pretty confident in saying that the inside of a library has books, or whatever those things with words inside them are called. Just because it's common doesn't mean it's not very, very wrong. Actually, in the linguistics field, the rule of thumb is generally that if a lot of people use it, it's just part of the evolution of language and not necessarily wrong. It's literally grammatically wrong though. There are a lot of aspects of AAVE that people would consider 'wrong' but are accepted by linguistics experts as correct in a valid dialect. I have a degree in linguistics. From the descriptivist perspective, if there is mutual intelligibility, then the usage is valid. The great American linguist Leonard Bloomfield observed many years ago that the child who learns to say I seen it has learned just as much as the one who says I saw it. The pattern of present, past and perfect of see, seen and seen in place of see, saw and seen reveals that speakers don’t put irregular verbs together just by combining a stem and a suffix, the way they form many thousands of English regular verbs. Language just changes like this. Just because someone speaks in grammatically incorrect sentences doesnt mean they're stupid. “I seen” isn’t so much a southern thing as it is an attribute of the AAVE dialect, where it can be correct to use. There’s a difference between formal and informal language.
