I have mixed feelings because my mother is not well and I am a non African young adult female and she wants me to go with her. She's planning on going to the embassy this week. Two outsider females in a strange land going 7k miles away from home to see someone who could be who he says he is or could be a charlatan and a heretic is a huge risk that I don't know I'm willing to take.

My mother is much more ill than she has let on. She struggles daily from past medical procedures along WITH diabetes. She is literally so desperate and I'm so much that she doesn't care whether she dies during the trip. She's convinced that she will be healed by her faith. I explained to her my reservations about the prophet being a fraud but she doesn't care. She doesn't believe he is a fraud, therefore in her mind he is not.

It is a fact that the "legitimacy" of any organization, including churches, cannot prevent internal con artists from abusing its members. Affinity fraud is always a risk.

Christian here, we are not talking about God here, and assuming an atheist had anything less valuable to say is quite naive. You are the biased one in this situation. We are talking about the people who have embezzled God's people. This is still happening now and you need to not be taken in by them.

He’s going to take her money.

I understand that people get desperate but that’s exactly what people like the Nigerian wants. He wants someone who is so desperate to get better that she’ll do anything and pay anything for help.

I believe the atheist is 100% correct in this case.

I'm a Christian. I believe in the power of the holy spirit and I believe that God can and occasionally does supernaturally heal. But I agree with what the post above says - legitimacy is no guarantee; there are scammers and cons artists everywhere, but nowhere more so than in these types of churches. Pray for healing, of course. But modern medicine will do more for your mother than a Nigerian money grabber ever will.

I would also be against going personally, but she might need to do it to learn for herself. I would still share your feelings as to why you think it’s a bad idea. If you keep her from going it may manifest in another way at a later date. I say let her do it and learn a lesson. It is her journey and everyone learns things in different ways.
