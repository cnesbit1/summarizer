A couple things to keep in mind that might help clear up some of your confusion over this.

1) Only very specific pages are to be released unredacted. That isn't done to increase your understanding of wtf is going on, it is done to help me do the waters.

2) There is an active investigation that this information is tied to, and by revealing sources and methods, that allows the parties being investigated to tamper with witnesses/evidence.

3) Trump is desperate to stop Mueller's investigation at any cost, even endangering national security just so he has the "grounds" to fire Rosenstein. In Trump's mind, it is "Trump first, everything else a distant second."

and even now trump is only releasing 20 pages of a 400 page document thats heavily redacted. the pages that he isnt releasing provide the basis of the claims being made in the fisa application.

trump is cherry picking information to present a fasle narrative just like nunes did.

The full records were released with redactions. This declassification only unredacts certain pages (less than 10%).

If the Mueller Investigation and the Russia probe are legit, then the FISA Docs and text messages should prove it so why don’t they want them declassified?

And right before the midterms? That would be a slam dunk.

Trump Guilty of Russia Collusion!!!

They aren’t cheering because they know exactly what these declassified documents are going to show.

The question becomes why unredact these specific pages and not the rest. As with any document release, what is not shown/released can be just as important to the story as what is shown. If CNN or Wikileaks had a full set of documents and only released certain parts that bolster their story, then both CNN and Wikileaks are not lying but they are definitely crafting a narrative.

This is why sharing of exculpatory evidence is critical in our legal system.
