Teachers do not establish policy or curriculum. Government does. A teacher's job is to educate students to best prepare them for the future. The conservative Ford government is hindering the teacher's ability to best prepare students for the future. It has forced policies that are unproven, ill researched (if at all) and detrimental to students futures. An employee duty is to follow the curriculum. I agree that teachers have always had a curriculum to teach, one that is developed by their government and employer. Public schools and publlic school employees have never had the option of teaching what they please. of course. They are employed by the school board (which I understand get their funding from the government). My board already sent emails out (the board, not any union) telling us to continue teaching the curriculum. They are willing to challenge the government and defend the teacher. I don't think people are understanding what a curriculum is. The curriculum is a set of MINIMUM expectations for a teacher to cover. If a teacher decides to use their professional judgment to go above and beyond the curriculum, its within their right to do so. However, you should not be evaluating students on it. That is the point, the instructions are not lawful and that is why the Elementary Teachersâ€™ Federation of Ontario is going to court. Teachers have been given instructions that contradict the conditions of their teaching licenses. It is the government job to set a minimum standards. It is the school board, school and teachers to take that minimum and go above and beyond.
