Everything was running smooth on the bike, but the chain was a little loose so I tightened it today. I tightened it to the specs listed in the manual and tried rolling the rear wheel (it was on a stand and in neutral). It rolled okay, but the chain was switching back and forth between being loose and tight. Uneven sprocket wear? Sprocket not centered/wrong size? Unevenly worn chain? Sections of the chain stiff or rusted? If the chain and sprockets weren't replaced together it can cause accelerated and maybe weird wear too. Supposedly it was a new chain as well. As far as I can tell the rear sprocket and the chain aren’t worn. I forgot to mention that the tension varies depending on your suspension extension. So if you are e.g. rolling the bike around and shifting enough weight to compress or extend the rear you will notice some change. It just has to be in spec at all times. It was noticeable while on the stand, rolling the bike in neutral and riding around. It hadn’t given me a problem before, but I probably just didn’t notice it because it was loose enough that I didn’t feel a big change. The current setup was fine, but I’m gonna try stock gearing and a new chain and see how that does. Replace everything and adjust per the updated chain specs for the WR. You can’t go wrong with Supersprox stealth rear, supersprox front and DID vx o ring chain.
