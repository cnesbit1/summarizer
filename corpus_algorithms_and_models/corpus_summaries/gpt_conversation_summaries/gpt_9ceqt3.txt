Dude, I'll tell you good sex is hard to find, like really, really hard. My first gf was similar, not a 10/10, but a solid 9. I thought sex with everyone would be like that as she was a total virgin but nah, I was incorrect.

Having been a swinger internationally, I can solidly say these women are like 1/100 rare. You can find them, and they are out there, which is exciting when you find them, but man you gotta look really hard.

It's even harder to find guys who give 10/10. Since most dudes can cum so easily, theres less reason for them to learn how to do it right for the girl. Le sigh

Well I guess women who really like having sex for sex are rare.

Imagine never being able to have satisfying see and then finding it in pockets here or there.

If you think women who enjoy having sex for sex are rare, you either dont know a lot of women or you just have a skewed view of our gender :/ I only know 1 woman who doesnt love (good) sex, and shes asexual and a virgin. Jackhammering can be fun but if that's all a guy is doing, that gets boring pretty damn fast. Some women maybe really like it. But it's mainly just for the guy. Theres no finesse to it, no rhythm, no utilization of angles and strokes. Yawn. This is why it's so much harder to find a guy who can give 10/10 sex lol and trust me most women dont have to "imagine" never finding satisfying sex lolol

If women like good sex, why don't they seek it out? Why are single women less seen at events were sex is available such as at swing clubs? You would think it would be 50/50 men and women if sex were so important to women, no?

What he is talking is raw enthusiasm. Sure, many women like sex, but there is giant chasm between someone who likes bread and someone who will fly to another country to taste one. It is a very rare thing.

Women don’t seek out sex because random men don’t *give* good sex.

They seek out relationships because it’s the best way to get fucked properly.

I am a woman.

It takes more effort to get a woman off. You need to learn how. You don’t need to learn how with a man.

A one night stand has no incentive to learn, and also no time to practice
