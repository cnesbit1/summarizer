Windshield. I've been wearing a helmet for the last year, but the prior 38 on the street, windshield.  
I wear an open face helmet with no windshield. The bugs and rocks are part of the experience I think.  
You still get smells and wind with a full face. You also get to keep your teeth.  
Lol full face helmets aren't air tight, you get tons of air. You can also ride with the visor open and close it on the highway like some (me) do.  
Never mind the right size bug or rock to the eye and youâ€™re fucked. Corneal abrasions are shitty. It can get worse beyond that.  
Fuck that, my visor deflects that stuff so I can see to ride home.  
Most riders going over bicycle speeds still wear eye protection of some kind even if they don't wear a helmet.  
I think it's hilarious because Sons of Anarchy had a bunch of scenes showing high speeds and no eye protection.  
I don't care how tough you are, about 1/2 the time I'm going over 70 mph without glasses, there are tears getting pulled out the sides of my eyes.  
One time a bug shot me dead center on the forehead. Other than that nothing has hit me because I have a windshield on my bike.
