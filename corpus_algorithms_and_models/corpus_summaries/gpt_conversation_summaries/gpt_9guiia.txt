I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl. The police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse. The police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station. The county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week. I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist. She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.
