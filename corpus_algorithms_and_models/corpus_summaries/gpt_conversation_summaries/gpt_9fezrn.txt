An edit to address some frequently brought up issues. This would be mainly for heavy traffic relief on highways /freeways/motorways/carriageways/what have you. As well as being able to move towards the front at traffic lights. Everyone states that lane splitting at 15mph/25kph would be unsafe when highways are going 70 mph /110 kph, but we feel that that is not the time to be splitting, only when traffic is slow or stopped, hence the hard limit.

Currently the proposal is worded to keep any existing splitting/filtering laws as they are.

Also, we need to make sure what we propose appeals to the whole population. Convincing your grandmother (who probably votes more than you as well) to allow lane splitting/filtering will be easier at current write up where it's for use in stopped or almost stopped traffic will be easier than convincing her that you can lane split at 65 mph/100 kph.

Next edit. After a lot of replies here, we are looking to add a delta speed clause for highways, but that's a much harder sell to the general population. Along those lines we Will also look into increasing it to 20mph/ 30 kph.

Everyone assumes where this is going to be, and that it's going to lower California current guidelines. As a lot of people have noticed our bill is based off one in Australia, and so far that speed has worked out fine.

The idea would be more filtering to the front of intersections or splitting through stopped or crawling traffic, not passing between cars going 75

We believe it will be safer to start at 15mph in stopped or slow traffic would be the safest way to get people ready for the sudden change in motorcycles driving past them. If they started doing this suddenly at 60 mph/100 kmph it could be more jarring and dangerous

I think you would have a better chance of passing this if you limited it to filtering. Basically, motorcycles are allowed to get to the front of the line at red lights.

Traffic studies of motorcycle accidents show that around 30-40 percent (depending on country) of motorcycle accidents occur under 15 mph/25 kph. That is what we are starting from and working from there. All subject to change and adjustment based on feedback
