Then why did he use "you", which is a pronoun that refers directly to whomever someone is replying to? Since he commented this as a reply to my post, "you" would be referring to me. Not sure why I'm getting downvoted into oblivion for a mistake most people would make.

It's common for people to comment on a post as if they're talking to the person in the post. When you didn't realize that, you got unexpectedly hostile. That's why you got downvotes. Take it as an opportunity for reflection and improvement.

He was making a joke towards a person in your post. He didn't make a mistake.

In your defense, I would feel like someone was talking to me directly if they commented on my post with “you”. I also didn’t sense any hostility from anyone until after you got down-voted, which I think would make anyone aggravated just because not everyone likes getting down-voted. Just wanted to comment because I was trying to look at it from your point of view and I kinda felt bad.
