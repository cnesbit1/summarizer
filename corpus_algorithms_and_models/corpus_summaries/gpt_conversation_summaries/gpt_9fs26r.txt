No condom no sex. I bet he wouldn't want a baby too. And if he leaves you over that then it sure hurts but you deserve so much better.

You can also get pregnant from precum, although the chances of that happening are less likely:

There's also nothing wrong with waiting until you feel comfortable OP. Everyone moves at different speeds and for someone your age you shouldn't feel guilty for wanting to wait longer than a month before having sex. I don't want to make things negative, but there's also the chance that you all will break up *afterwards*. Do it on your own time, when you're ready, not as a bargaining chip to make sure he doesn't leave.

If he doesn't respect you enough to wear a fucking rubber, don't fuck him.

I got my girlfriend pregnant in high school. Because I was stupid and didn’t want to wear a condom. No pressure. I just didn’t respect her enough to not ruin her life.

I’m bitter that I’m the one that has had to come up with an answer to my son as to why he’s not there and doesn’t want to be there. I’m bitter that 16 years later this person still holds this power over my life, despite not being here.

I’m better than this and I know it.

If he's pressuring her into sex without protection, he's an asshole who doesn't get to have sex.

Don’t fuck up your future plans over some guy. Use a condom or get birth control. He’s 19, his “pull out” game is weak af.

They call people who rely on the pull out method "parents". You can get pregnant without him cumming inside you.
