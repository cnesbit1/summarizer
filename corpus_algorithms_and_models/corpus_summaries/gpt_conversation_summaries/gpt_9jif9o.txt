Congrats on the new one, and good luck along the way! I think he will appreciate the comments when he sees these later! Thanks!  
I am actually getting my motorcycle license next week! Then we will be riding together all the time.  
very nice to hear. enjoy the hell out of it and stay safe.  
It really does put it into a new perspective!  
Don’t feel old, my dad was about 38 when I was born (I’m now 20) and my sister when he was 40, you’ve still got plenty of time :)
