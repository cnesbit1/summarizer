Welp, John Kerry said it was brought down "in a controlled fashion". And Larry Silverstein said there was a decision made to 'pull it' and 'then we watched the building collapse'.  
John Kerry famously said that he thought 7 was ["brought down in a controlled fashion."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsJjYwYOAA)  
I think Silverstein was talking about pulling firefighters out of the building, since at that point there was no real reason to try and save it.  
Nah, firefighters abandoned building 7 long before it collapsed. There was nobody there. As for the John Kerry statement, google is your friend.  
There's no real time given when Silverstein said to "Pull it." It could have been hours before it collapsed, before they pulled the firefighters out.  
Listen to him. "A decision was made to pull it, and then we watched the building collapse". It's very clear. But keep lying to yourself.  
That interview was from a year later. The timeframe of that comment is not clear.  
It doesn't seem like he was that well informed about tower 7. The guy asking the question also says that "pull it" is the standard term in the industry. From what I can tell, it's not.
