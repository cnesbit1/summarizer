I suspect we are probably unfortunately in the twilight of serious Remembrance Day events. As more and more time passes on and more and more people in Canada have no personal connection to those who fought or the history of the country itself veterans affairs is going to have a tougher and tougher time creating a Remembrance Day people can relate to. Off the mark. WW1 and 2 were dominantly Anglo Canadian events in Canada. The French Canadians, FN, and recent migrants have little to no attachment to it. Many of those "third workers" had family who fought in the first and second world war. Much of Canada was built by many people of mainly European descent. Germans, fins, poles, Ukrainians, etc. WWI and WWII were largely fought in France. French people suffered tremendously. Also fought in North Africa, Japan, the Pacific Islands,...called *world wars* for a reason. Part of the "little" attachment. WW1 and even WW2 created massive protests in Quebec and other French Canadians. Include riots and deep political divides. They saw it as an "English" war that had little to do with them.
