Daily rides an GS500 (Or drives in winter), the CBX absolutely chugs the fuel being a 6 pot Thanks for your reply. I suppose fuel in Germany is quite expensive. As fuel gets more expensive the big pot bikes will get ridden less often. Oh yeah that area was expensive, so was the Netherlands, nearly 1.80Eur/liter! Makes me glad my 250 was good on fuel though, managed to get away with only filling up in Belgium where it's about 1.30/liter I really envy US fuel prices, even felt cheap af despite visiting from Australia during shitty exchange rates for comparison: Currently, where I live (in germany, I mean), a liter of normal Fuel is going for 1,35€ to 1,58€. Filling up my Marauder used to be about 14 Euros, now it´s close to 15€ for a whole load. I feel sorry for people with bigger engines, especially mutliple cylinders. There is nowhere on the planet where fuel is so expensive it justifies owning a bike that you ride less than 60kms per year. Holy shit. In my part of Canada I'm currently paying the equivalent of 0.98 Euro/liter. And everyone here, myself included, thing it's crazy high lately. I can't imagine how anyone can afford to drive while paying that much for fuel. My CB600F gets an average of around 6 liters / 100km. My tank takes around 15 litres to the brim and I get between 230 \~ 250km / tank of fuel. Where I live gas is around 1,20€ \~ 1,50€, depending on the gas station. They definitely handled poorly. Neat bikes, but they stopped building them after a few years for a reason.
