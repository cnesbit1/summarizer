It depends on the girl. I have a higher sex drive than most guys I have dated. Some girls want it just as much as guys do. Some girls don't.  
Men have far more testosterone, so they naturally do have higher sex drives by a large margin.  
I either just ask for sex or initiate it or if they aren't feeling it I take care of myself. It hasn't caused any conflict in my relationships. And I personally don't think it's a hormonal imbalance situation, girls can like sex as much as guys.  
Stress and other factors are quite often a symptom of low testosterone  
Women with higher levels of testosterone have higher sex drives. It's why it's often advocated for a women to work out if she wants to raise her drive.  
I don't know a single women who thinks about sex the way that me and my high T friends do. With that said, we have a epidemic of dadbods who play video games, watch TV all night and eat shit food; so there are a lot of men who have a lower drive than their wives.
