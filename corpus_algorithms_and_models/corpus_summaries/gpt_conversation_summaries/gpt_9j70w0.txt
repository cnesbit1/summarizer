There is a case to be made that
1. **Russia and Trump colluded to influence the election**
2. **The “deep state” is trying to get Trump out of power by framing him and his colleagues**
3. ** This is all a show to distract us from something larger at work and both sides are probably chummy with each-other **

#All three of these are conflicting possibilities that deserve some analysis.

Republican Comey, whose announcement about the Clinton email investigation helped Trump, was leading the investigation until Trump fired him. Rosenstein, a Republican and Trump appointee, named Republican Mueller as special counsel to run the investigation. The investigations in congress are/were chaired by Republicans.

Russia was definitely astroturfing, but so were numerous other factions and the overall effectiveness of Russia's shenanigans [is debatable](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-much-did-russian-interference-affect-the-2016-election/). And stuff like the staged DNC "hack" (which was used as the reason for [Obama to ask James Clapper](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/07/24/clapper_obama_ordered_the_intelligence_assessment_that_resulted_in_mueller_investigation.html) for the [2017 ICA](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf) ) is pretty easy to stage if the authorities play along (which they largely did).

And no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to have an effect. We don't have any evidence that Trump gave anything to them or that they gave anything to Trump

However that doesn't mean there's no evidence of Russian collusion

we do have evidence of Hillary Clinton and her campaign purchasing Russian propaganda in the form of a phony dossier from both the Russian government and a British spy

We didn't know that the Russian propaganda that Hillary paid Russia for was used to try to influence the election and then to try to undermine the president of the United States. Which should be considered treason anyway.

before you bring up any Trump Tower meetings literally nothing happened at that meeting. There was nothing wrong with the meeting in the first place. Since Trump jr. Was simply following up on a lead that Hillary Clinton may have done something illegal. But the meeting went nowhere anyway. Trump jr. Gave nothing to the lawyer and the lawyer gave nothing to Trump jr.

and before you bring up any arrests or indictments you'll have to remember that literally no person
