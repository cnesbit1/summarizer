At 2pm my buddy and I are getting Five Guys, and I ordered a burger and a "Little" fry (smallest size they have). Little did I know that apparently it's standard procedure for the workers to give you quadruple the amount of fries you expected. 

At 2:45pm I'm driving my buddy back to the hotel (19 of us live in a hotel while our new house gets built) and as I start to leave the lot, I see a car double-parked *directly center* over the yellow line. 

That's when I looked down at the greasy bag of projectiles at my feet. So with the blessing of God himself I mustered all my strength to grab that sweet, hefty scoop that only comes once in a generation, and I catapulted it out of my window at the back of the double-parked car. 

Then a little later, the buddy I dropped off texts me and says the hotel staff is looking for me. And they're pissed. 

Anyway, I immediately got worried because I both felt really bad and didn't want to have to pay some huge fine. So I called the front desk after class and said "Hi, I'm the guy who threw the fries at the car". 

In the end, I was on my hands and knees picking up fries off the ground of a parking lot. 

But one last detail. After all of this, as I was slaving away picking up fries, I noticed something: the car was no longer double-parked. No, they moved it to a single parking space, like a civilized driver.
