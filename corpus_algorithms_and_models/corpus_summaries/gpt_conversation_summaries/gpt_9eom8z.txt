But in the modern era of electric communication we must protect our values in the physical space as well as the digital space.  
Freedom of speech. Freedom of expression. Freedom for all. Equality for all.  
If what someone says is legal it shouldn't be censored.  
Frankly I don't think anyone should control how YouTube or Google controls content. It's like complaining about a TV channel taking down your favorite show.  
You fail to see what humanity is becoming. The internet is becoming apart of us more by the day. We're not far off from being able to access the internet in our minds. We need to start preparing for the future and ensure human rights on the web.  
so when you complain about buisness censorship it rings hollow to a large percentage of the population. maybe not you specifically or maybe you, but the right in general is tasting its own shit. the same shit that they forced down everyones throats.  
Not the guy you were replying to, but the right is PRO-corporate interests.  
The real right is extremely authoritarian. Are you joking?  
The political spectrum goes form freedom to totalitarianism. It's that simple.  
Politics is a lot more nuanced than that, buddy. "Freedum" is just ... A nebulous promise leaders promise their useful idiots who love simple, easily digestable buzzwords because they lack the mental strength to actually think.
