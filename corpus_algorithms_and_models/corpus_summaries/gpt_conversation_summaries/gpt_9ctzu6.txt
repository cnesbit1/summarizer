She got him on audio admitting that he raped her. Any defamation suit would be of very little use.

He admitted all kinds of things in the recorded interview, but he consistently refused to admit to rape.

Utah is a one party consent state, but there's an effort to pass a law requiring both parties to consent to recording supported by, of course, the LDS. https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900009626/bill-would-require-consent-to-record-a-conversation-in-utah.html

Her case based on the audio tape was already dismissed because of statute of limitations. She has one charge before the court regarding the church cover-up I think

She did have a case. The judge...a Mormon, dismissed it because it of statutes of limitations. 

But for decades she tried to get help, even from police (who were also all Mormon). She tried to get help long before finally hiring a lawyer. 

There is still a case open against the Mormon church for covering it up. But I think I read theyâ€™re having a hard time getting any records of the abuse that she reported over and over and over.
