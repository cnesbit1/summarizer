Its a government funded school and shouldnt be placating to one religion. US public schools service all Americans not just Christian Americans. If they wouldnt put a Koran verse out there then they shouldnt put a Bible verse  
Keep in mind that this is a private business that is advertising. The owner of the gym is certainly very firm in his beliefs, but that is not what is being advertised. He wants people who see the ad to go work out at his gym. If there happened to be a Muslimfit gym and they refused advertising to that one, then there is a cut and dry argument.  
I garuntee that school would not let a muslim business owner put some Islamic verbiage on that field  
I can't see how that should offend any Christian, except that it is written in Arabic.  
It shouldn't, but this is a part of Louisiana where the dominant from of Christianity is filled with people that will die before they admit that Catholics are Christian too. Put something on a football field in Arabic and I wouldn't be surprised to see news articles about lynchings.  
Hell, I just saw a story in which a Texan school girl of (East) Indian background was not allowed to draw the Taj Mahal for an outdoor display because "it looked too much like a mosque", even though explicitly Christian content by other children was permitted.
