I recently started trying out some dating sites and quickly found out how some men feel entitled to certain things. The first example of this was when I matched with a guy who's profile said he was only a year younger than me, but in fact wasn't even old enough to drink. He then saw that as a challenge to make me change my mind. After about two weeks of no contact, he messages me out of the blue trying for the third time to make me change my mind. I had had enough. I asked him if he actually knew the meaning of the word no. That seemed to make him mad and instead of apologizing, his only answer was "whatever." I quickly deleted him.

The second time was after I had finally made some connections with people. It would quickly change from them being friendly to expecting me to send them nudes. They would then think that badgering me about it would make me change my mind. I can't tell you how many times I would hear, "Just go to the bathroom and lock the door" as if that would make me say "Oh of course! Let me get right on that!"

The third time I had met someone who was only in town for a couple of days. He would message me 4 or 5 times a day just asking to hookup RIGHT NOW or he was just off work and wanted to see me, or wanted me to send him nudes. Finally after not hearing from him for a week, I get the dreaded message "I'm free. Let's hookup." I finally had it. I told him that I'm sorry but it wasn't going to work. Instead of accepting it and moving on, his response was "Well at least blow me once" as if I owed him for giving my number out in the first place.
