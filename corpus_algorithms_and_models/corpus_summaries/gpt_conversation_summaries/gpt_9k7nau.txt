Honestly you can grow more with God but just staying at home and studying for yourself, most of these churches peach fluff anyways. God does not even require of us to go to church, he wants us to keep his sabbath and have a close relationship with him. No it doesn't. Watching what is supposed to be a sermon on the day's readings turned into one woman's personal anti-male crusade goes against the Bible itself. Sometimes cultures make corrections, thank God!, and they are often very hard swings. And only zealots have the courage to lead. She is on the side of equality and that may take time to settle into place. Be patient. You see, back in the civil rights days, they were trying to bring people together. No Jew or Gentile, you see that above. No division. No special treatment of one group over another. Giving everyone legal rights. Treating everyone the same and moving towards unity, as was commanded by the Gospel. What this modern stuff is trying to do is get rid of things like "due process" towards men, and set women against men. That's in opposition to the Gospel. So you are wrong. Now, they're marching for the inverse. Which is against Scripture and the will of God. How can you disagree that the Civil Rights movement was designed to break down barriers and treat black and white people equally? To get rid of segregation, to integrate schools, churches, lunch counters? That that is in the spirit of the Scriptures, which clearly says "there is no Jew or Greek, no male or female."
