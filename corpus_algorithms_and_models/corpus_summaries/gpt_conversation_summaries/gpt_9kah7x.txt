For example; I'm a Flames fan, Gio is the heart and soul of the team right now but father time is not on his side. When Giordano eventually calls it quits, it sure is looking like our little shit disturber Matthew Tkachuk will be taking over as the captain for him. I think it will be Coots,TK, or Provy. TK could very well be that guy as it feels like he is the 'leader' of the young guys right now. Patrick was a captain for Brandon so he is a good candidate as well. In my opinion it'll be Couturier, he's 25 right now and has been with the team what seems like forever, plus a playoff hat trick on a torn MCL screams captain material. Edit: Oh just figured out it's Konecny. You guys need better nicknames. Nah TK is a good nickname. That's ironic, I've seen Leaf fans refer to Matthews as AM or AM34. I’m sure they’re going to call Tavares JT as well...
