I have been bullied a lot in the passed and it made me quite self conscious

But it has been worse with my recent Fuck Friend, he's the type of guy that has been with many girls and can get any girl he wants if he tries

Hes still an important friend for me,

Ive been in pretty bad abusing relations in the past so..

This is not a good choice for a fuck buddy then. These type of relationships only work if both of you are purely in it for sex. Once emotions get involved someone will be hurt.

I understand. You'll have to change your perspective. Insecurity can make you question everything. You'll have to purposefully control your thoughts because you'll never enjoy the moment.

If he makes you feel like you're unimportant to him, that's a sign that this sexual relationship is not a good idea.

I'm sorry hun but as fuck buddies, you're both "using" each other. It sounds harsh when you say it that way but the truth is you go to each other for sex, no strings attached.

I know that in a certain degree he is, but hes honest about it

Yeah I get your point but I wouldn't worry about it. I say take the compliment and believe him. At the very least he respects you enough to care about your self esteem.

Again, I'd advise you to just blindly believe he finds you attractive and don't think about it too much. Having charm matters way more anyway ðŸ˜‰
