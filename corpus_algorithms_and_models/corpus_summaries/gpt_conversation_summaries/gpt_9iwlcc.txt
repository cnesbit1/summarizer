I'm currently dating someone who's scared that one day I'll suddenly feel she's not worth my effort cause she's stupid or slow and I'll go find another girl that's smarter than her. She's so afraid that she would rather pre-emptively leave so it's on her terms (I had to talk her down from it once or twice in the past month or so).

I've been constantly telling her that it's okay to be stupid around me, that she doesn't have to turn into Einstein in order to appease me? Sure at times if she says something absolutely bizarre I'd ask "what in the fuck was that lmao" but like, even I ask myself that when I do something dumb.

I really do appreciate and love this girl but I don't know what else I can really do to show that I love everything about her even if she says something absolutely dumb at times?

Seems like she has self esteem issues. Assure her that you like her just the way she is and maybe don't sound so surprised at the absolutely bizarre things she do so she'll be more comfortable doing her stuff.

Let her know that its normal for people to ask stupid questions. Its normal for people to be stupid. Theres probably someone who’s dumber than her (that’s me). Then try to find out what makes her think or feel that way. Was it your reaction? Her certification or something? Then work on it. If you think you’re not good enough at something, then go improve. Reading articles will help. Tell her youre not going to leave her just because she thinks she dumb. 

Please communicate with her more often.

It helps to do little things to reassure her, like hugging her whenever you meet, smiling at her when you see her, surprising her with loving gifts.
