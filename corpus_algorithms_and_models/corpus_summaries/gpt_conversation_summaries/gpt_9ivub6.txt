Sounds like someone's never been in a group chat
Right? Sometimes I'll wake up to 200 messages that was just my sisters sending memes to each other.
This is why you mute the group chat before you go to bed
Sometimes I easily get 100+ messages in half an hour. Spammy group chats are very much a thing
I struggle with serve depression, anxiety, ptsd, and isolation. My texts are a daily reminder that I avoid a lot of human interaction and I’m sorry it’s upset so many of you too :(
I mean I had 600 at one point because of group chats. When your in like 10 different ones messages rack up pretty quick.
Friends + group projects + coworkers resulted in a whopping 1000+ messages once in a day. The combination of the eurovision song festival and a deadline the next Monday made for one hell of a text message ride.
