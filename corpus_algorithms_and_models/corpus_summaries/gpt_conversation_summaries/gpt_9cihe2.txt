Assault rifles are not "heavily restricted", they're illegal. They have been for decades. 

All firearm possession is unlawful unless you have a license. People who follow the law to get a license, who transport and store firearms as specified and who use them in a lawful manor aren't the problem. 

What category is an AR-15 in? I understand it's not considered an assault rifle by those in the know. 

The AR-15 is Restricted, despite meeting all criteria for Non-Restricted. 

In 2016 we had 130 homicides committed with handguns in Canada. 

Restrictions on legal gun owners are not only targeting the wrong group of people, it's also political grandstanding to harvest votes based on fear and ignorance of real issues we face in the form of poor border security and gang presence in places like Toronto. 

Legal gun owners want illegal guns and gun violence eradicated at least as much as, but probably even more than you do. 

Suicides and accidental deaths make up the bulk of firearms related deaths in the country, but somehow I don't think you're concerned about what people are doing to themselves with their guns unless you feel you can use it to bolster your rhetoric that guns are bad. 

Yes, suicides do make up the grand majority of firearm deaths, but that's a mental health issue, not a violent crime issue. 

Assault rifles have a definition. You're thinking 'assault weapon' which is just a media term that means nothing other than 'scary gun'.
