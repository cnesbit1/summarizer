Right after sex I had a woman get excited over my butt.

Being somewhat self conscious, it was nice to have someone get excited over some part of my body with an absolute glee. It was pretty random and unexpected, but I layed there for a good 5 minutes happily getting my butt squeezed.

Woke up to her giving me a blowjob, 10/10 would have happen again

Yes of course. So, I have never had a sexual intercourse with someone who isn't my boyfriend so what I'm saying is my feeling about some hypothetical situation I have never experienced.

If I had sex with someone I just met and then fell asleep with him and then I wake up on him eating me, I'm not sure how I'd feel about it. It's like, sex is over, I'm asleep, we don't really know each other's preferences and boundaries so before trying something that MIGHT make the other one feel uncomfortable, we should talk about it.

You are totally fair in thinking that, no one should ever, EVER, assume that what they are doing sexually is okay before asking for consent.

Talk about the hypothetical possibility of being woken up with sex beforehand and then do it or don't. I wouldn't do this with a ONS, or want it done to me.

Giving someone consent once doesn't mean you're giving them consent forever. Consent should never just be assumed.

After we were done, she told me I was the biggest she had ever had.

Reading all these comments about men being happy to hear they have big penises, i'm wondering what is the equivalent of big dick for a woman ? It's definitely not big boobs or big butt

Equivalent would be “your body is fucking hot”. While men are blessed with only penis-insecurities, women get to “enjoy” insecurities about their whole body, no matter what shape they are.

Fingering me while on my period.
