Curling takes a lot of practice, don't beat yourself up about it! I find it much easier to use a straight iron to do curls. Practice before showers :) even having done my hair with hot tools since 13 and I still mess up every now and then. ❤️ you'll get the hang of it, slowly but surely. Keep watching tutorials on youtube, find the technique that's easiest for you, and practice when you don't have to be going anywhere :) That's right, don't clamp the end inside, it'll get a kink! I highly recommend hitting up youtube, there are endless curling tutorials, and being able to see everything makes it so much easier. So, you start at the top, and you kinda wiggle your way down with one wrap under the clamp. When you get to the end, don't pull the end through the clamp, hold it around the outside. Then open and release everything. Yeup, start at the scalp and pull down, should be easier. I have long, fine, silky hair, I could curl it with an iron for 30 minutes straight at 400 degrees and 10 minutes later, it'll be like it never happened. It's basically rollers or bust for me. Damp hair, slow drying, setting spray, then don't touch under pain of death. I think you should also keep in mind that even in these days of being surrounded by loose Rapunzel waves, some of us are meant to rock the straight silky look. Embrace your inner Marsha Brady.
