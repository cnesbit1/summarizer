Because that money would be better somewhere else. Suspension, etc... or a lower price tag.  
I donâ€™t think they are mono blocks. I think they are the same Brembo I have in my 1090 adventure R. And they suck ass.  
What do you expect Guzzi to do? They used brembo practically since they started making brake parts, and they generally stick with Italian components on all their bikes, which is definitely cool and not very common in modern world.  
They are just too strong to use with semi knobby type tires. Simple as that.  
It's also what BMW, Triumph, Ducati and KTM use on their adventure bikes. I guess this is the current general notion for premium large road-oriented adv bikes.  
As with all such bikes, they will be used mainly on the road, so I don't see a problem with good brakes.
