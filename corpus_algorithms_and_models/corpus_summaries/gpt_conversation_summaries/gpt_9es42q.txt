Inverted nipples are great they are nothing to be insecure about, with subs like r/InvertedNipples it's easy to see plenty of people love them.

And like you and you partner have discovered adds some fun getting them to come out.

You probably don't have your setting set to say you are over 18 and want to see NSFW content.

You can browse this sub without having the 18+ settings turned on, you will see any post they isn't flagged NSFW I'm pretty sure

This sub is geared more towards educational than smutty, thus not flagging the entire sub
