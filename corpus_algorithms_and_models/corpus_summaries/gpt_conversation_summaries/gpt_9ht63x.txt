I feel more like a wolf in sheep's clothing the more effort I put in to being a faithful Christian. As soon as I try going to church or a Christian group, I feel seriously out of place or as if I don't belong and need to get as far away as possible. It totally depends on the church. When I moved to LA it took me so long to find a church where I felt at home. I'd suggest checking out some different denominations if you're not too locked into a particular doctrine. Well, how else do you justify the abhorrent things that happen everyday? God is almighty and knowing. It's all his plan. To be honest you’ve hit the nail on the head of a question religious people have struggled with for millennia. You kind of can’t justify it. That’s part of what faith is. Faith that God really is good, even though all that awful shit happens. Again, certain people don’t like having the way they live their life questioned, but if God is real and almighty the way we’re told, I think he’s strong enough to handle real objections like why does suffering exist. Answer number one: This world has such awful things in it because we have free will. Human beings are flawed, angry, prideful and greedy. Even the best of us. If everyone were to follow Christ's teaching to love everyone, care for the poor and the sick and to give freely of ourselves, then War, famine, and AIDS babies in Africa would not be problems. But, as the world is full of pain and suffering, we need to be a part of the world in order to understand it, reach out and empathize with it. To have compassion. When someone is going through something, the support of a person who has gone through that thing and can say "Here I am. I got through it. So can you." can be very helpful. I was homeless for almost two years about 12 years ago. Now I make very good money, live in a great neighborhood and have a beautiful wife and kid. That was the transformative power of God in my life. But going through that period of having nothing was so important to who I am now. When I was 13 my mom had stage 4 breast cancer. I am an only child of a single mom. If she had died, that was my whole family. Thanks to the doctors at Virginia Mason in Seattle, she survived. She was on an experimental chemo and she was the only person to survive it. Science saved her
