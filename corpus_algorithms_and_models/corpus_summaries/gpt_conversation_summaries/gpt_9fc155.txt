Thanks so much Reddit, for calling attention to the most worthy of ConsPiracy movements. You do our work for us.  
Because it's mods and owners are paid off by government to hide agendas.  
If they can't surpress it no spending monies.  
If you don't see how that front page of Reddit is manipulated man you're out your turret.  
You know there are limits to free speech right?  
Paid off by corporations and individuals. Government is just bought.  
That's not really the case, although you can commit crimes with your speech. It's not the speech which is illegal, it's the intended real world harm which makes it illegal.  
Yeah, just look at facebook how that narrative enforcement worked out for them.  
What these retards don't realize is that the effect of your actions are felt with a considerable delay, and at the point when visitor count starts dropping it is too late to change direction. Facebook and reddit are soon known in the same context as myspace.
