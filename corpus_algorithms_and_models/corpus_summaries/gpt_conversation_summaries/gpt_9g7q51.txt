I mean due to all the media the leaf prospects are always simultaneously over and under hyped but I’d have to maybe say Liljegren. Now I think he will be a great defenceman and has the best chance of being a top pairing defenceman some day out of our prospects but most leaf fans and media treat him like it’s a forgone conclusion that he will be a #1 or 2 D in a couple years which is quite the expectation to live up to. Most people I’ve seen have said in 2 years time he will be with Rielly on the top pair and that we just need Hainsey or Zaitsev to suffice until then. Projecting he plays in the AHL 1 year, then Leafs the next, and earns his way to the top pair isn't that hard to believe. Especially when the team can't afford free agents since next year we have to hand out some big contracts. I mean we expect him to play on our top pairing, doesn't mean he's a top pairing defenseman just that he would be the best option. I have seen people suggest he’d be in the show next season and that’s fair to say. He’ll be given the Dermott treatment with sheltered minutes. Especially on the leafs where there isn't much competition on the right side for that #1-2 spot, it's definitely possible Liligren can crack that spot.
