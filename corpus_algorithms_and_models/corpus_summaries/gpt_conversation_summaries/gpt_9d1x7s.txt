This is like, the least offensive non-standard font i've ever seen in one of these. It's actually readable.
The font is super easy to read, I don't know what everyone is complaining about.
It was the purple *combined* with the font that made it painful for me.
You can actually text over messenger on Android. It shows up like a regular messenger chat but it texts (I think through a web service) from your number
Messenger has an SMS option, I believe
Ew no thanks, I'd rather Facebook not have access to my actual text messages.
Yeah, I don't use it for SMS. Messenger feels a bit crowded and resource heavy to me sometimes but I still use it. There's also a Messenger Lite app as well that strips away a lot of the extras.
Right? Every time they ask me to merge my SMS I'm like "Nice try, Facebook..."
I don't even have the messenger or Facebook apps on my phone anymore. Screw that shit.
Want to import contacts from your phone? It needs access your contacts to do that. Want to send pictures? It needs access to your files/camera. Want to use voice-to-text? It needs your mic. Want to make a call using Messenger? It needs to be able to access your phone function. You can disable the permissions individually in Settings on Android or deny it in-app, you just won't be able to use a lot of those functions. Given Facebook's track record on privacy, I can understand anyone being wary though.
Ah, well, you should still be able to manage app permissions on an iPhone as well.

I didn’t know it was through messenger when I posted the original comment
Just going off the super limited context we got, OP seems to be named Rhylee and the other person seems to be texting OP thinking they're a different Rhylee that they know.
But it's cringe when the person texting the wrong number refuses to acknowledge that it's a wrong number.
I think the cringe is that the person texting can’t/won’t understand that they have the wrong number
Sometimes I think people just upvote titles, even when the titles need context to make even a shred of sense.
What ever Rhylee i'm done.
That's something Rhylee would say.
