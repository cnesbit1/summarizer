I strongly suggest looking at a bike other than the Rebel 250 for starters. VTR250s are a much better, more powerful, much more fun bike, and not available in the US, so it'll be a new experience for you. Plus, they're way more suited to the roads you'll be encountering.

The Kii peninsula has a lot to offer, but 8 hours is a short time to spend there. If you think you can make it, I highly suggest Mt. Koya and the ancient temple complex there, as well as the extremely fun Ryujin-Koyasan skyline (route 371).

Wherever you end up going, spend some time with google street view, and avoid the prefectural routes (shown as yellow in google maps). Look for the smaller white roads which will keep you away from the more dense traffic.

The Rebel won't handle in the hills and narrow roads as well as the VTR250 will. It's an ok bike, I've ridden it, but it's lacking the torque you'll need.

I've been riding daily here for almost 10 years. It's very safe compared to the US. Speed limits are ridiculously slow though (almost all roads are 50 kph or less), so that could take some time getting used to. You can get away with moderate speeding, but don't push it too much. I think your biggest surprise here will be how technical the roads are.

I also suggest looking into OSMAnd (or OSMios for iPhone) for routing your ride. Google maps can't be downloaded and used offline in Japan due to some kind of corporate legal thing. Google maps also tends to reroute you to the major roads, and towards the traffic. I only use it for point A to point B navigation. OSM is free, you can download the maps so it works offline, and it can be quickly programmed with a specific route. I suggest downloading it and spending some time learning how to use it before you come here, so you're familiar with it before you have to rely on it.

A word of warning, route 425 (Ryujin - Totsukawa) down there looks tempting but it's considered to be one of the worst national routes in Japan. I blundered in there on a damp autumn day and spent the next 30-40km slipping the clutch in 2nd and hoping not to fall off a cliff.

There has been some road damage in Wakayama with the past few typhoons and resulting heavy rains. [This site](http://www2
