Even some countries that are significantly poorer than Canada have more paid vacation time. Government created a new holiday "family day" in February and my employer used a loop hole to get out of paying for an other day off. They used my division's status as a transportation company and claimed we are federally regulated so provincial holiday don't apply to us. Best managed companies is a marketing firm. You pay to get on the application list, then pay an annual fee to stay on it. Businesses pay minimum wage and mandatory vacation pay because its legislated. If it wasn’t, they probably wouldn’t. They passively shame people for taking sick days. If you do take sick days your expected to at least respond to emails. Essentially if you are able to sit up and read you can work. They even award people who have 100% attendance with gifts and public acknowledement. Employees have one additional holiday, depending on where they work – a civic holiday, a provincial holiday or the first Monday in August. Family Day is not recognized in the federal sphere, federal employees in all provinces (such as public servants and postal workers) work on this day. Without legislation, businesses would pay what the market will bear. For people making minimum wage, this would be less than minimum wage. In other words, business would pay what employees demanded. If people were willing to work for less, they would pay less.
