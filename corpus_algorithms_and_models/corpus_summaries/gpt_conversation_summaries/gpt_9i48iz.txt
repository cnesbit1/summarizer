I'm curious how everyone keeps their shoes from getting scuffed by the shifter? I see there are some products available but I'm thinking there must be an at home solution. Maybe electrical tape? I just bought a new pair of white shoes and I want to wear them to work but I dont want them to get ruined.  
Well you should be wearing boots that cover your ankles so that's a start.  
Even at 10mph if you lay the bike down and your foot gets pinned under it that's instant skin removal to the bone. If you need something dressy that covers your ankle there are options.  
This sub has a boner for ATGATT, and for good reason.  
Virtually any pair of over the ankle boots is better than some flimsy shoes.  
If that's how you slide, sure. My dad's a paramedic (he rides too) and had a patient last year who was in armired jacket, pants, gloves, full face...and New Balances. He went down on the freeway and his foot found itself between the bike and the ground for a significant portion of the slide and was ground to shit. Just a meaty, crunchy dangle thing attached to the lower leg.  
Getting a leg pinned under sounds like a bad time too though. I finally started wearing armored pants and I feel much better.
