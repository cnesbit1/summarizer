Finally my mom and husband pushed me to seek out therapy.  
My therapist immediately said I need to get bloodwork done for vitamin D and thyroid testing.  
So when I met my new doctor (I just aged out of my pediatric doctor) I told her everything and she listened.  
My results came back 24 hours later. My TSH levels were extremely high.  
I was also severely deficient in vitamin D and my doctor already prescribed me supplements.  
But hearing that there might be a physical problem makes me feel so relieved.  
I don't know what kind of doctor you are are referring to.  
Any primary care doctor can order thyroid panels.  
The point is that GPs don't KNOW when you have an issue.  
I've read that the panels that are typically run for thyroid don't always catch when you have a thyroid problem.  
I am expecting a referral soon.  
That is very true in my experience.
