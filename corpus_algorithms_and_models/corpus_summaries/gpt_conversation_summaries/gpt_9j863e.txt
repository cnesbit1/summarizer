I personally just skip over the content on /r/hockey that doesn't interest me.  
If everyone posted everything related to their teams in that teams sub then r/hockey would basically cease to exist.  
You're obsessed with hating on the leafs.  
This guys entire existence is going on Reddit and hating on the Leafs/Tavares. The saltiest man alive.  
I agree with you bro, there is nothing noteworthy about this goal but it hits the front page of hockey because its the Laughs, then their fans proceed to mock you for Tavares. Classic
