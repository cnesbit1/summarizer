Consent is important. Ask for a verbal yes, that one word can save so much confusion and hurt feelings later. If a person does not want to have sex then they need to say no. Communication is very important. Regretting a sexual encounter because of poor communication does not equal sexual assault. Taking off your clothes and making out is sexual signaling that you're ready. He was indeed immature by not asking for consent before doing something he knew she didn't want and then lying to about it. What is your objective with this post? Are you ok with what he did? You both needed to communicate better. The very short answer is no. The longer answer requires a little examination. The same thing is true here. She told him that she wanted to have sex. They find somewhere to have sex. They voluntarily took their clothes off. They voluntarily participated in sex acts. He checked to see she was enjoying herself. She admits she was, but as it turns out, she wasn't fully aware of the act being committed. He stops that act when he realizes that that was the case. Lying about remaining outside of her underwear is immature—which isn't surprising when the parties are 19 & 21 years old—but it isn't criminal.
