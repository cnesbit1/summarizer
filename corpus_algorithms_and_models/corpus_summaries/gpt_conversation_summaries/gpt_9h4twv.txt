They are statistics for a reason - it’s a common occurrence, nothing to feel ashamed of. Better that it happens now rather than when you’re 35 or 45. Make a clean break, spend a bit of time recovering and getting to know yourself as a single adult, then get back out there.  
When trust is broken then it's tough to continue.  
It's respect, communication, compromise and most importantly unconditional love and understanding.  
Without trust, there is no relationship.  
And once that trust is broken, it's almost impossible to get it back.  
Just remember that if you decide to ride this out, it will almost definitely happen again.  
Smart move, hurt is something you have to deal with in life, sometimes in a situation as such, dont let it destroy you just try to grow from it, there's Tons more to do in life after this, remember that... it always seems to help me stay positive and stand up for myself  
If your partner does not have that, there is no longer any trust between you and then what is left?...  
Im this exact statistic, but now I’m 2 years post divorce. And a million percent happier.

End it man. She's cheated and manipulating you. You can do and deserve better.  
Relationships require mutual work and desire for betterment.
