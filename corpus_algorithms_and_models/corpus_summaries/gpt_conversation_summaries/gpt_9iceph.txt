Anyone else get this visceral feeling of pure dread every monday morning?  
Pretty much every Monday of my life as long as had school / work, but at least it generally doesn't affect me on Sunday night  
Has yours ever gotten so bad that you begin to feel physically sick? Think my boss has given me mild ptsd  
Feeling it right now, actually. Slightly nauseous with a small weight sitting where I think my diaphragm is. Can only wait for it to leave. Take care...  
If it happens too often, consider that something in your life possibly needs to change..  
There's a middle ground between excited and miserable  
I get it on Sunday night  
Mate, how have you not resigned y-  
Beggars can't be choosers man  
Only one day since I got my ear pierced, is it advisable to change earring now?  
no  
when I got my ears pierced, piercer told me to wait 6 weeks before changing the stud. I don't think you have to wait that long? but you def can't change your stud so soon either  
Please don't. I know it looks like shit now but the reason why you have to keep it there is to let the wound recover properly and prevent infection from happening.  
Anyway swapping earrings early is not advisable cause 1) it bloody hurts 2) may cause irritation and therefore your wound may take longer to heal 3) may cause infection  
Fortunately, my ear has now healed well. No infection nor pain.  
no dont lol. leave it in for at least 2 weeks otherwise it will close up or get infected. and you don't want an infection, that shit's nasty.  
gonna miss some of the kids when practicum ends this week 😭esp this boy in playgroup who's damn cute,everyday I ask him what colour is the toy and he goes,"*Blueee?*"  
I wish I loved my job as much as you do  
Same situation for my internship, can't wait to finish it lol  
Jia youuu!!! You can do this💪🏻💪🏻  
Thanks, you too!
