We as a society have just.. enabled it. It is important to note that buying thousands of fake Instagram followers is a thing. influencers are just the newest version of FHM, Maxim, Stuff, et al. not a coincidence that all of them shut down as Instagram gained popularity. A free app on your phone suffices. The funny thing is the products they tend to advertise might be out of the reach of their largest audience. With friends in the advertising industry, influencer advertising is also slowly dying, because views and likes are now starting to not translate into actual sales. Brands are also starting to look to spend their money elsewhere instead of just "quote me for 10% off"
