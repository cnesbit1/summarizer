I don't see a reddit username in the article? How would that be considered doxxing?  
exposes a person's name connected to a reddit account. Last person that posted one a couple days ago from blp got banned. proceed at your own risk.  
Yeah, should definitely be reported and removed.  
Mostly just warning OP. Last person that posted one from blp doxxing was banned.  
I did it is in the image when discussing the employee. I wouldn't have said it was doxxing if it wasn't very clearly doing so.  
Not up to you. We are against doxxing here as it can be a reason to terminate this sub regardless of their beliefs since it has to do with sitewide rules. Less than 5 days ago a similar case occurred and the thread was shutdown and OP was banned. BLP should be blacklisted similar to CNN for doxxing since this is twice in less than a week.  
The board, the user, and the moderator who approved it gets nuked though.  
Thems be the reddit rules.  
That's fucked up too. I feel like there is going to continue to be a lot of this.  
It's a shame that subreddits exist merely to harass other subreddits and users.  
One of reddit's biggest mistakes.
