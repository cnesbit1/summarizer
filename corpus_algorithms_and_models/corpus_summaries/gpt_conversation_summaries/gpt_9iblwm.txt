Quebec Liberal leader Phillipe Couillard told a radio station this week that a family of three could eat for a week on C$75 ($57; Â£45).  
To be fair, the guy said there are people having to do it, not that they should have to.  
He also said that it won't be diverse, won't be good and won't be balanced, but it's possible to live with that.  
Actually, to eat cheap, you generally have to go with higher quality fresh, frozen or dried food. Canned food is generally too expensive.  
With some skill it can be done. We did it when we were poor.  
Oddly Quebec has a long culinary tradition of making tasty dishes out of cheap food... but I guess that's a lost art in today's world.  
People today have no concept of how poor people were in our recent past.  
People think they're starving if they aren't eating steaks and cheeseburgers for lunch.  
Junk food is actually quite pricey. The way to save money is to buy cheapest cuts and avoid anything pre-processed.  
Get a slow cooker. They are not expensive to buy and with a few inexpensive ingredients you can make excellent quality meals.  
You can absolutely feed 3 people with 75$ per week. Beans and rice.
