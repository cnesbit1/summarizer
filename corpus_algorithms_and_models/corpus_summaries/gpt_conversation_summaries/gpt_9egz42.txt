Need some advice on how to tackle interview questions that catches people off guard, for eg. "what is one special talent that you would like to showcase?"  
whatever you do, remember that it is perfectly ok to stop and think for a few moments (but not too long of course) to try and think of an answer. you do not have to blurt out something on the spot - always gather your thoughts even if you instantaneously think of something, and speak deliberately.  
I have always found the best way to deal with most questions is to tie to back to a core story (this isn't really a real interview technique but adapted from another discipline) - I go into the interview with a very prepared and consistent story of who I am, why am I good at, what can I bring to the table, and what I am looking for. no matter how strange the question is, even if I give a slightly weak answer, as long as I tie it back to my core story - I should be able to leave an impression in the interviewer's mind.  
its quite a mental exercise, but you can start off by crafting your own core story like "i am a very enthu redditor who is here to change the world through my keyboard warrior skills". every of your answers should tie back to that. once you get the fundamentals pat down, then you work to inject subtlety, wit, humour, some self-deprecation, deadpan...whatever you want.  
I see, i always find myself in a panic to blurt answer immediately in interviews and presentations, gotta fix that up.  
Will try your advice about establishing a core story, thanks!  
yup, even if you feel panicky, just remind yourself that it is ok to pause and think.
