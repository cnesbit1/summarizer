I’m SO glad to be in Canada. Having fertility issues is hard enough!  
Yes taxes here are expensive but it’s worth it. My mom and dad also have health issues. My mom has cerosis of the liver and diabetes. My dad has sick kidneys and will need surgery. I won’t have to pay for anything.  
My brother was in a debilitating accident and after all the surgeries and the month long hospital stay they moved him to a rehabilitation center - all for free! My family couldn't have paid for a fraction of the procedures he had, let alone the hospital stays and rehab had we lived in the US. So glad to be Canadian!  
I just want to say good luck! Hope everything g works out happy and safe for you and the little one eventually.  
Congratulations on your pregnancy! I wish you a happy and healthy experience and baby!  
I’m glad everything worked out, but it isn’t free.  
I’m so happy you’re wife has recovered! I can’t imagine going through that, you’re both so strong.  
I’m so sorry for your losses. I’m glad you weren’t financially burdened along with it.  
Thank you. I hope you have a boring rest of your pregnancy <3  
Ah yes you got me. We pay through the nose in taxes. But have you ever wondered why we’re happy to do it? Peace of mind.
