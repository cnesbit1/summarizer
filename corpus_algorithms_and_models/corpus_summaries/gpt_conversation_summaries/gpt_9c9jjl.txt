That could be bacteria with the blood and tissue discharge, in all honesty, I would see a gynecologist. They will be able to perform a more thorough examination.  
Get a Xanax and take half, also go to a woman who was recommended. Also insist on a full STD work up while you’re there. If you’re insecure about that just say your ex- boyfriend cheated. Cover your bases.  
Find someone you can see without fear. Your lady parts need a doctor and they need one that deals with those issues all the time.  
I have a family member that almost died of ovarian cancer because she was afraid of the gynecologist. Go. It might just be a weird smell now but someday it’ll be something different. It could be life or death.  
They’re great about this stuff. For my first exam, which would likely include a Pap smear, I’d try to score a Xanax to calm down. That or a whole lot of tension tamer tea.
