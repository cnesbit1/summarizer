Christianity is in slow decline, mostly due to secularisation, yet it holds enough cultural power in the country. Sadly, Islam is growing due to immigration and converts. Converts to Islam donâ€™t always come from Christianity as far as I know. Most fall is due to that people becoming Atheists. The Muslims are mostly immigrants and they are mostly muslim because of their family. Muslim is on the rise, not because people convert but because foreign people coming here. It's only a slight rise though. But the Netherlands is a free society where you have the freedom to practise religion as long as it doesn't influence other peoples freedom.
