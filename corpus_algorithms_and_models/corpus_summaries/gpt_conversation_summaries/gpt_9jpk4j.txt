I grew up believing Noah's ark literally happened roughly 5,000 years ago. I'm just curious what the various beliefs are on this and the justification is for those beliefs Yes, because if it didn't happen, the bible is wrong, and what else is it wrong in? Is Jesus God? Did he rise from the dead? Is he really the only way to heaven? Now you are asking the real questions! Careful, that lead me to deconvert. Spoiler alert, the bible is FILLED with contradictions. I sometimes wonder what we will be saying when we are all in the throne room and we all realize how wrong we were about the nature of God. We wont be wondering anything, we will cease to exist.

The reason why I don't really consider myself to be a Christian was started by just one passage and wanting to know the truth. Once I realized that Bible was not true, the rest was easy. While I still believe in God and I'd say there is maybe a 10-30% chance that Jesus was the son of God, people need to have the attitude the the person above you had. Either believe it all, or none of it. But they also need to learn to be objective and think for themselves.

If you can't respond to legitimate questions from skeptics without resorting to threats, you have no business talking to them in the first place. God is infallible. Man is fallible. Nothing in the Bible is incorrect. Only how we perceive it or interpret it is fallible. Hermeneutics is a skill not a ton of people have studied and applied so we get a ton of misconceptions on what scripture is. But... who wrote the bible...? I guess we miss the point of God inspiring something and it being perfect v man inspired to write and it being less than perfect. If you want to pick and choose what you think is correct or incorrect in scripture, you will have a field day. But there are exact examples in the bible where two opposite things are said where they can not both be true. For example, Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 tell two completely different creation stories Study more my brother. The Bible never contradicts itself. God is
