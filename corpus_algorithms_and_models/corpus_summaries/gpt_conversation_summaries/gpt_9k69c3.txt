If it's that important to you then leave him. If not then best to talk to him about this and make your thoughts clear to him. Yeah if you really are into this guy, communication is pretty important. I hope things work out for you. Oh ok. Then just talk to him about it and see what he says. I hope things works out. If they are grossed out by that then what the hell are they having sex for? So how does that make sense? We're talking about a double standard here. If 2 people both don't like giving or receiving oral or it in't strictly necessary or whatever the reason, that's another story. But if one person expects to get oral but refuses to give it, that is selfish, by definition. No ome is shaming you for your preferences, we're shaming people who don't equally reciprocate and give no effort to try. You ARE describing men to be selfish when it's them recieving but not giving and saying they have no excuse.
