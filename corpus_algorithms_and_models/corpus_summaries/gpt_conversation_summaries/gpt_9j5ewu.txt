He lets the dude get head control, and just keeps wailing on a fucking helmet while the dude gets control of his body and then simply foot sweeps him.

He makes zero attempt to go for any kind of defensive position while on his back, just keeping his legs flat and not in between him and his opponent.

A fucking BJJ seminar for 20 minutes would make him slightly more able to defend himself, little along others.

I used to train with some cops, and it was a little disturbing how bad some of them were at defending themselves.
