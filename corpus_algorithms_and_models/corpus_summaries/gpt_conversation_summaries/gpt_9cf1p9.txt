She's Ted Cruz's daughter. Do you need more than that? 

But seriously, I'm sure she felt kind of annoyed at being bussed around to be used as a political game piece. 

The way his own kid rejects him should tell you something. 

As much as I hate Ted Cruz, and don't get me wrong he's a huge scum bag, she was a little girl being dragged around the country on a bus and it was the end of the day. 

In the end you're seeing a small moment captured on camera catching his daughter in a crusty mood. 

He regurgitated, started to spit out, and then swallowed a tonsil stone on camera during a primary debate. 

It's more about Cruz being willing to use his daughter against her wishes. 

Use her for trying to give her a kiss? 

Especially when they try to stage a kiss for the camera. 

Between this and the gif where he hits his wife in the face repeatedly, I feel that Ted Cruz is the most cringey politician ever.
