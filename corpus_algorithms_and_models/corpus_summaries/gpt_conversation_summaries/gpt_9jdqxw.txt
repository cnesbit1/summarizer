We got them so we could sleep better after having a baby. We also got a ridiculously comfortable new king sized bed. We then went to bed and had an absolute marathon sex session. Final tally, she came 3 times, I came once. I highly recommend. 

Each cube is ~2mg. We started out taking one, waiting an hour, take one more, wait an hour and take a third. That was ok but felt weak. Next night we took two together and I took a third quickly after. I actually felt kinda high. Then last night I just took two together and had some vodka tonics with it and thats probably my perfect amount right now. Sex is great and I am sleeping so much better than I have been.

5 seems like a good place to start. Most of the edibles sold here start at 10 but you can always cut them in half. 10 mg is considered 1 "dose", but it differs depending on each edible as each manufacturer has different processes. after a few times, you might notice more effects from the same dose as cannabis tends to have a reverse tolerance of sorts. definitely try 10 sometime when you're feeling adventurous, probably not near enough to really fuck you up or overdo it. Eat something fatty with it.  You get more bang for your buck.
