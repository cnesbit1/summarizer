The next morning, in a haze, I woke up with a headache and dreamlike memories from the night before. I called up one of my classmates that was out with us and asked him if we did anything recreationally, he said no. One of my friends calls me to ask if someone tried to get us to go with them as we were leaving the arcade bar. I vaguely remember someone trying to get us to leave with them, we were the last two females left in the group. Being the paranoid person I am, I took an at home drug test that tests for everything (PCP, cocaine, amphetimines, barbiturates, benzos, THC, etc). I tested positive for both barbiturates and benzos. With the rise in popularity of arcade bars, ladies and gents please be careful and mindful of where you set your drink. Luckily I was with a great group of people with good intentions, otherwise that night could have turned into something more sinister. The police and the bar need to know about this ASAP. If there's any chance of serious negative side effects from the drugs, I'd also add a hospital to that list. 100% at the very least she should alert the bar so they can try to review security footage and then possibly can go to the police from there. I'm very embarrassed that this happened, I haven't even told my partner. Call the bar and ask to talk to a manager about your concerns and to see if they have any CCTV that might have picked the guy up. Call the police either way.
