The stock exhaust is so damn quiet. Requires a full exhaust replacement. You can find a couple of options on Revzilla but each are about a grand. Nah just cut the can off and throw an akra on it. You'll have to do some fab work for the pipes but you can make it happen pretty cheap. Untill you get hit because someone doesn't see or HEAR YOU. Wear more appropriate clothing and ride in a more defensive and predictable fashion and you won't have any problem with this. If you need to be heard, that's what a horn is for. The majority of time though, a louder exhaust isn't going to be audible from the people in the situations where you need to be heard most. Less obnoxious to the people around you and less attention from the police. Plus frankly it's so much funnier to smoke people when they don't expect it. I guess thats your experience but ive revbombed drivers coming into my lane that moved right back into there lane. Please be smarter then to think people in cars with the radio on can hear a wimpy little motorcycle horn. Plus, honestly, most of the time, you are much safer just moving away when somebody tries to come into your lane. And I'm saying that the people that can hear you can already see you -- because you are in front of them. Just admit that this has nothing to do with safety and let's move on with our lives. Okay well I like my loud exhaust, so you are right.... still not getting rid of my pipe. Loud jokes save lives.
