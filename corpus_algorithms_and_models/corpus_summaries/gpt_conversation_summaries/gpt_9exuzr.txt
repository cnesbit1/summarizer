*'ROME - After seeing all the doors of the World Championship closed in the face, this time it is Romano Fenati who takes a step back and announces his intention to abandon the racing world. In an interview with Repubblica, the centaur from the Marche told his madness and his intentions for the future: " With the championship I have closed. I will never run again. It is no longer my world. Too much injustice. I was wrong, it's true: I apologize to everyone ".*

*EXPLANATION With these words Fenati made his debut in the interview, and then went on to try to explain the reasons that led him to act in this way: " Do you want to see my helmet and suit? There is a long black strip: the Manzi rubber. He attacked me three times and he too could have killed me, as you say. The last time he had done it 500 meters before, so I thought: now I do the same, I show you that I can be "bad" like you. And maybe you'll finally understand what it means. But I never thought to hurt him, I swear. " While on the future he explained: Â«For a while I will work at his grandfather's hardware stores, with him and his mother. After all, I already did it. And then, I have a project in Ascoli: but I prefer not to talk about it. If I miss the races? I have always come on the track to win. To be Romano Fenati. But I realize that nobody cares about me, about what I'm suffering. So, better say goodbye. Forever.'*
