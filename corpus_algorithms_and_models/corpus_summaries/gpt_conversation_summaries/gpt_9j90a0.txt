Last week we couldn't have PIV sex because I was recovering from a UTI. We settled on me giving him a handjob with him hovering over me so he could cum on my tits, which has been something I've wanted to experience for a while. So he came on my tits, and I took a finger and used that to lick up his cum. And his *immediate* reaction was "Ew!" 

The reason I licked it up was because I've seen it in porn frequently and thought it was something guys found hot? I know he watches porn so I figured he would have seen this before? He never complains when I give him blowjobs and swallow so I don't know what the problem is? 

Edit: To everyone saying I should not copy stuff I see in porn - I typically do not, and it seems like a majority of people in the comments find what I did hot. 

To everyone saying I should dump my FWB, ain't happening. I talked with him and we had a good laugh about the whole thing. I'll take my good sex and be content!
