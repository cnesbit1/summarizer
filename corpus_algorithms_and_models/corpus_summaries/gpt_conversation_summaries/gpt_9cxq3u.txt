There have been statements (I can’t remember if it was Wirtz or McDonough) that if we start the year off badly, expect to see changes. And I don’t think that means changes in the lineup. Q and Bowman are definitely in the hot seat. The organization has made it clear their priority is making the playoffs, if we suck again then Q or Bowman will be replaced. If I'm Chicago I'd fire Bowman before Q. He did manage to keep their core intact but at the same time, he's given out about 5-6 very very questionable overpayments, 3 of which are/were crippling salary-wise and seems to be more content on brining in former Hawks in an effort to improve rather than changing up the supplementary pieces around their core. Bowman also made a few questionable trades. His trade deadline moves haven't been great other than the Vermette trade. I agree, but I think he’s realized he needs to adapt. There was an article a few weeks ago, don’t have it right now, where he was talking about sitting Dineen and Samuelsson down to rewatch basically all our games the past two seasons and look at what worked/what failed. I think he’ll always have his favorites but he showed this past season he can change, evidenced by things like sitting Seabrook, taking Duncs off the PP and reducing his minutes, dropping the minutes of Hossa/Sharp and taking Sharp off the PK, etc. I disagree personally, while Stan has made some bad mistakes the past few years, he’s done a very good job at building up our prospect pool and finding gems from overseas.
