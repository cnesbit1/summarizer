They focus too much on the actual memorisation of words and idioms. I just wish that they would focus more on daily conversational stuff, which I feel is more important. How is forcing them to answer questions based on a bunch of China stories going to help if they are reading something that they're unfamiliar to begin with? Rote learning is definitely a product of outdated teaching methods. If they don't use the language frequently outside the classroom, they have to be taught like they are strangers to the language. Different methods of learning the language should be included in addition to the current syllabus in order to adapt to the current situation in Singapore. I feel that it's the Chinese characters that's the problem. I'm sorry it offends you that others don't value the same things you do. Because Chinese is not the official working language or medium of choice. It's a second language and should be treated as such. Most kids are unable to even speak more than a few sentences without having to use English. Lol people like you just don't get it, and that's why the Chinese language is dying a slow and painful death in Singapore.
