I live in Sweden and can say this about the country with the second highest suicide rate in single households in the WORLD . Its a country with 4-6 months in darkness , rain and snow, and now also populated with over 300 000 young men from afghanistan and Syria, Iran. 

There is a huge difference in the attitude and intent of different immigrant groups. The immigrants of the 60:s - 90:s mostly sought to assimilate and became well-functioning parts of society, adapted to swedish culture and joined the workforce. A huge part of the current wave of immigrants don't want to assimilate or adopt Swedish values, or even work to earn their place here.

That kind of economic analysis has been debunked over and over because it doesn't differentiate between labor immigration and welfare immigration, and also fails to account for a lot of the costs associated with immigration in other areas of society. 

Edit: yes, as I expected the analysis is completely inaccurate. They are measuring growth in terms of GDP and not GDP per capita. A growth in GDP is expected with massive population growth. What they fail to account for is that compared to how many people we are GDP is actually lower now than before.
