So i had a rugby game yesterday and by half time my contact lenses had fallen out, so i subbed off at half time and while i was watching the second half of the game i was getting annoyed at my blurry vision. 

as i grab the fence with my hand and jump leading with my feet one after the other i realize ive grabbed the fucking gate segment and it doesn't have a latch! 

all the spectators in the grand stand and everyone standing along the fence, that i thought i was about to majestically clear, see me sprawled on my ass on the concrete and i flush instantly and begin to laugh awkwardly and apologize (dont know what for? looking like a fuck?) as i run into the changing rooms. 

so fast forward past laughs and retelling from my family and team mates that saw this fuck up unfold in all its glory, my right ass cheek hurts like bastard. 

TLDR: was going to get my glasses, tried to jump an unlatched gate segment of a fence that was in my path, gate opened landed on my ass, everyone saw, now my right ass cheek hurts like hell. 

Jumping a fence almost never ends well 

I guess I just don't have enough fence hopping practice then 

It really depends on the fence though, doesn't it? 

Those are a bitch to get over. 

Yes, it does. 

But every fence has its exceptions. 

I guess some people just don't know the secret. 

Like that scene on Hot Fuzz 

Can confirm, broke my nose jumping a fence while buzzed and in front of crowd.
