The /r/conspiracy mod team is proud of our cohesiveness, and we are proud of our transparency, and this incident called into question both of these mandates. We did *not* anticipate that a "bug" would remove wax *and* the rest of the mod team. The reality is that inviting the team back, and having everyone accept in the same order, was going to be all but impossible (everyone has to be online at once which can be ferociously difficult to coordinate). As a result, getting the mod list back into the proper order required intervention from the reddit admins, and they removed SC as well, as this type of "rogue" moderator behavior is not tolerated, for obvious reasons. In the meantime, I suddenly found myself as the *only* mod of a 700k-strong sub, and it was approaching midnight my time. Fortunately, the sticky attracted the attention of several other mods, and by the end of the night I had re-invited all of the mods back to the team who were currently active in that thread. The next morning we immediately enlisted the help of the admins and they restored the list to the proper order, just as I had anticipated. In addition, they apologized for what was apparently a mistake caused by a bot, and indeed they even thanked us for finding the bug! Out of respect for the admins, I've waited for permission to share the screenshots of our interactions, as they should overwhelmingly corroborate everything I'm telling you. Instead of taking days or weeks, this bug *immediately* removed IW *and the rest of the mod team* and I found myself in a very difficult position.
