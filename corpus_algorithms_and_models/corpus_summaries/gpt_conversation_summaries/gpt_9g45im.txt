Driving behind a car on the highway (at speed) when the passenger of said car vomits out the window. It turned into a fine mist and covered me and my bike.  
Wasp to the Adams apple at 50mph while ATGATT. Fucker found about the only piece of uncovered skin and splattered his venom all over.  
Before ATGATT was really a thing (the 70’s), my Dad got hit by a june bug in the chest while riding in a T-shirt. Said it felt like he had been shot.  
I've had a couple of yellow jackets go down my shirt. I had to beat them to death. We both had a bad day.  
Caught a bee to the face right when I flipped my visor up on a hot day for a little air.  
I never wore any gear at all until I caught a wasp up my nostril at about 80. I’ve worn full face ever since. I wear a jacket too now since if I’m probably going to survive I’d like to keep some skin  
Had that too, as well as small stones and other shit hitting my neck. I now wear my neck warmer unless it's too hot, rather than only when it's particularly cold  
I actually have a buff that I use at times but on the Blue Ridge Parkway tooling around at 45 to 50 mph on an 85 degree day in an aerostitch roadcrafter and full face helmet, you just are not going to seal up much more.
