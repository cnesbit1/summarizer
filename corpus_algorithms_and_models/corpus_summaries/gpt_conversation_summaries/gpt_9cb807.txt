Yep I still have zero clue , cause I didnt brake, gave enough gas to straight up the lean angle and my tire pressure was good as well.  
Wrong about the tires and cold part cause this happened around 5 PM and I was riding for like 40 min to 50 before this happened on a hot day and the tires are 2 months old and about 2500km on them. And I have leaned far more before for slower turn.  
Tires can cool off rather quickly. But ya. Just go with the idea of it being an anomaly lol 👍🏻  
How could the tires be cold if he was riding for two thirds of an hour before this?  
Wasn’t trolling. Was just my opinion on what happened. How dare I don’t have psychic powers to know he was riding all day. Also, just cause he was riding doesn’t mean his tires can handle ANYTHING that’s thrown at them. I’m all ears to hear your explanation of his crash.  
Been riding for 10+ years with 2 crashes. One my fault and one was a drivers fault.  
OP straight up told you that he'd been riding for nearly an hour, and your response was basically "nah bro your tires had cooled down".  
Lmao ok cool it wasn’t his tires then, I also mentioned how quick he leaned over could’ve part of the problem along with as you mentioned accelerating and unloading the front. I’m fine with being wrong, I have nothing to prove.
