An hero  
It's a reference.  
Truly an hero to take the downvotes even when making a solid reference  
Old school grammarians figure h deserves the “an.” If you’ve ever watched Frazier you’ll notice the snooty characters all do it (and if you keep an ear out IRL you’ll notice the same thing!)  
I’m not sure, and that’s a cool question actually. It depends on whether it was written into rule or if it was something people started saying out loud to make it easier to say. I haven’t looked into it much, but I’d assume it’s also when written- Frazier most likely wouldn’t adopt it if it didn’t have some kind of pretentious literary placement.  
man I've been getting owned own reddit lately for grammar. It's humbling.  
Eh, anyone who cares about grammar is a goofball imo. If something makes sense it makes sense, who cares?  
An hero indeed!  
No it's an old meme  
It's an old meme, it's supposed to be wrong
