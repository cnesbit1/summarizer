Interesting that you picked one party over the others when all their leaders inherited their prosperity from their families.  
Well, I was going to sing the praises of Trudeau and his smartness for inheriting his wealth, but then I remembered how _despite_ that, he was dumb enough to not just get a normie job, but _two_ of them!  
He inherited enough from his dad to make him a millionaire, and his public speaking gigs keep him wealthy, fear not!  
He _could_ have been smart like the Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford, and just worked from the inheritance.  But nah, Trudeau was too stupid for that.  
Nice hair though.
