Dont politicize the issue. Democrats &amp; Republicans can have rational debates on age of consent &amp; degree of genetic separation without resorting to namecalling.  
It took entirely too long for the sarcasm to register. Poe's law and all that  
Please don't make jokes like that.

No matter how much of a monster someone is, you can only hate them once.  
*I mean if you want to be outraged, we have been outraged at the Republicans for decades, &amp; shit continues.  
Correct. However, now is not the right time for discussing this, being that it is so soon after the alleged affair has been brought to light by the woman involved.
