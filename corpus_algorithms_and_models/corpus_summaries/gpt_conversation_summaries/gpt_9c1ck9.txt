I’ve just known several women (honestly both genders but mostly women) who did the same thing, some in an attempt to “regain control” of their bodies after some sexual abuse, others as a way of getting back at their ex’s, and I see the consistent pattern that at the end of these sexual binges. Live your life and enjoy yourself but please don’t use your body as a tool. That’s all. It’s worth more and so are you but if this is your choice then so be it I support your ability to make it, regardless of my personal feelings on the matter. I meant it’s worth more than being used as a tool, especially considering that tool is what’s keeping you alive and the diseases that can spring into action can change that very quickly. I think I understand your confusion but yea, not what I said or meant. Across no doubt but I think men repress it more. Though I think it hits women harder from a societal and personal view. It depends on the person I agree but the people who can do it and do it safely I believe are far and few between. I agree, sex is honestly mind blowing with someone you love, though fucking your friends is fair in my opinion, I’ve had a girl friend or two who I’ve been more than ok hooking up with and possibly more than once. It amazes me how people get down voted for expressing thoughts of caution. I think maybe she already feels that.. that's why she wants to be wanted by everyone. I’m a literal whore and I don’t think I’m stained or worthless. I don’t hate myself at all. I think it’s bloody brilliant. I’ve learnt so much about myself and about people, my confidence has soared, my emotional intelligence has improved, I don’t have to worry about money, I get to make people happy and feel good about themselves, I get to have exciting and new experiences and meet people I would never normally come into contact with, I get to travel, I’m independent, and it just suits me perfectly.
