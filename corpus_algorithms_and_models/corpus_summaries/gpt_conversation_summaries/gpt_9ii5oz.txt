Between guys at 24 having PCS and someone as young as 27 having had advanced stages of CTE (Aaron Hernandez), it would make me insanely hesitant to let a future kid of mine enrol in a highly physical sport.  
Parents don't want to deal with the injuries(and other factors like cost) are slowly pushing people away.  
I remember games that ended in brawls after guys got hit from behind and carried off on spinal boards and refs being completely powerless to stop it, and the number of guys so excited to impress girls in the stands that they'd goon it up over making the right play 10/10 times.  
I don't know if it exists but I think there should be a more beer league style of game for kids.  
This is why I think north america will eventually catch the soccer bug.  
I read something about how the volume of subconcussive hits contributes more than a handful of concussions.  
I was just thinkin of how many times guys head the ball just juggling and practicing.  
Would not recommend playing football for kids.  
“High burnout rates from pushing children into travel soccer too young as well as the high costs of programs have also contributed to the lower numbers.  
There are too many talented kids that are left off the pitch because their families can’t afford the insane amounts a cash needed to participate in travel leagues.  
I think its best in my opinion for coaches to explain how damaging it is health wise to cheap shot.  
I put my kids in soccer rather than football or hockey.  
I played HS football for 3 years.  
On the upside, a lot of the physicality is going to be weeded out of hockey over the next decade or two.
