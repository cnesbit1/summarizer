He wants to end corporate welfare.  
Universal healthcare benefits the people and he's pushing to end it.  
He wants to introduce a two tiered system, not eliminate universal healthcare. The best healthcare systems in the world are two tiered, look at France and many other europeon countries.  
Many other countries have two tier healthcare, and can provide better than what weâ€™re doing now.  
So the rich can get access to healthcare before the rest of us.  
In other words he wants the rich to have more options. Which could pull doctors from the standard health care sector and make wait times for non rich folks longer. The only people any private health care would benefit are the rich. Fuck that.  
The rich already have more options, they simply go to the US. How about we instead offer the same private services the rich are already receiving in US, but in Canada and redirect those profits into our woefully unsustainable healthcare system.  
Healthcare is rapidly approaching 50% of provincial budgets, the money has to come from somewhere.  
Also, to your last point: Universal mixed public/private healthcare benefits everyone precisely because it provides much needed funding to the public system.  
Are you aware that Australia, The UK, All of Europe and literally every country with better healthcare than us has some form of two-tier healthcare?  
Actually it would reduce burden on the public system as well which would improve it.  
Way to ignore the issue of the rich getting better health care than everyone else.  
It's demonstrable that offering private tiers reduces burden and also increases funding and efficiencies for public healthcare as long as it does not effect availability of procedures and essential services.  
It demonstrably increases quality of care for the public system and increases healthcare as a whole.  
At the end of the day if a new system means the rich get better or faster treatment then I am completely against it.  
Take the time to look up how systems in countries like France work, and how beneficial it is (literally considered the best healthcare systems in the world) A two tiered system does not only benefit the rich, not by far.  
We already bleed doctors and nurses to the USA due to the salary differential.  
The rich already travel for better healthcare.  
But not at the expense of the rest of us.  
If we provide a system for the rich to seek faster care in our own country, that money is staying within our economy.  
Because its undustainable.  
Medical costs are rising much faster than GDP.  
Every year literally hundreds
