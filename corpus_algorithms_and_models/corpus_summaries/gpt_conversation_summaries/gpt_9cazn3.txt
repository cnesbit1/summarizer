He has 607 in 1003 games played.  
I would love for him to be the undisputed best goal scorer.  
Most goals will not make him the undisputed best goal scorer though  
He's certainly in the conversation for greatest goal scorer as it stands, scoring the most goals ever would make him undeniably the GOAT  
No one from 2005 on his era compares to him as a goal scorer  
Ovi has played in the one of the toughest times to score goals, if he breaks the career record he's definitely the undisputed best goal scorer ever.  
Not to mention the lockout shortened season(could be another 20 there) and the times he was made to play more d, that could be another 20-30 there for all we know.  
I still think he can get it if he plays into his 40s.  
Ovechkin is one of only four players to score 50 multiple times from 05/06 to today, and the only one to do it more than twice (he's done it 7 times).  
There are fewer goals available and fewer high-end goal scorers around today than there were in the 80's.  
While Gretzky's got the bigger numbers, Ovechkin's are arguably more impressive when compared to his era.  
I know he’s already 32 but nothing this season showed me that he can’t win another 2-3 Richards and stay in the top 10 in goalscoring until his late 30s.  
If he scores 50 two more times, then 40 twice, then 30 twice, then 20 three times, he'd hit 907 goals by age 41.  
He seems to have adapted to his diminishing speed and can still score at a high level.  
If he remains durable, doesn't have to endure another lockout, and can stick around the league (Leonsis will let him stay for as long as he wants I'm sure) I think there's a chance he could challenge for it.
