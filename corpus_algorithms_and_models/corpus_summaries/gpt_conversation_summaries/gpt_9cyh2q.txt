Proper etiquette would have been them asking you if you were ok with them doing this, but they failed to do that.  
It's a big hotel... go find another place!  
Most creative sex-spots I've ever had were because the bed wasn't available.  
Don't be too worried that you're found.. hotel staff have probably seen it all. You're just having sex, it's not like you're practicing an embarrassing fetish no one's supposed to know about.  
I worked at a hotel for years. Please don't do this. You would be putting the staff in a very uncomfortable position & it would most likely end up in you being removed from the property. We are in the business of selling rooms, not hosting wild closet sex.  
If my bro brought a girl back when I'm trying to sleep I'd beat the shit out of him for the disrespect.  
That shit ain't cool and uncomfortable and should never impose like that on someone what is wrong with you?  
Sex isn't that big of a deal. If your need to cum outweighs respecting the people you call friends you need to get over yourself.  
No. I'm just not a shitty person who doesn't take 12 seconds to let my buddy know I'd like to have sex. If he wants to stay, fine.  
My buddies and I communicate. They'd be aware of the possibility when I went out.  
People who've had healthy and fulfilling sex lives certainly don't act like you suggest.
