When I did customer care for a certain credit cards call center, we had a regular caller who would very quietly ask a question, so quiet you can't hear it. You'd have to ask him to speak up, since as long as you can hear another person and it seems like they're responding you can't just hang up. This guy would make you repeat yourself asking him to speak up a half dozen times before finally saying very loudly "do you mind if I jerk my cock while I talk to you?" I only ever got his call once, but I immediately hung up on him. Gross shit.  
Worked for this ISP doing overnight tech support on a team of about only 13-14 people and this guy would always call around the same time at like 2 in the morning. He would only speak with the women on the team. If he called and got a guy he would immediately hang up. We always knew when he was calling because all the guys would get hang ups one after another. Around half the team was female so sometimes he would get a woman right away. Once he got a female on the phone he would just say perverted shit and would whisper it. Most of the females would just immediately hang up on him but there was this one girl who was like fuck it and would try talking to him. This would really throw him off because he was expecting a woman to be disgusted and I think that might of been what got him off. When this one female would get him she would just act really sarcastic by saying stuff like "Oh really, that's great...." He actually stopped talking to her after a couple of times and would hang up on her. He eventually got charged iirc or the police might have had him committed. I'm not sure what the outcome was because he was in North Carolina but he stopped calling. The brainiac forgot he was calling not only his ISP but we were also his phone company so we had all of his information.  
I used to work at a beauty supply store, and we had a man who would call a couple times a month asking what kind of cotton we had, it was always funny when a new girl would answer not knowing about him, and try to answer all his weird cotton questions as he got more and more turned on. They learned pretty quickly.  
As a woman who works for a crisis hotline and have gotten prank calls from men using the line as wank fodder, it's not hilarious to me. It can feel really violating.
