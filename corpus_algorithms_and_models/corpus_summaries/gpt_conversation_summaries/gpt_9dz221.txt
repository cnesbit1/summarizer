It's been a few years since I've seen them before today, and so last month my wife made a suggestion that we take a trip down to their house for a surprise visit, which is about 3,000 miles away (we all live in the united states.)

We had our friend text my parents that night to ask them if they could drive down to a restaurant next to their house at 8 o'clock in the morning to meet up with him for breakfast, and they agreed.

So my friend, my wife and I all go to the restaurant as soon as it opened while my friends wife watched our kids, because they were still sleeping.

We were at the restaurant for an hour when my parents finally showed up (on time).

My mom started crying and my dad looked happier than ever.

With my dad being Italian, he was very stern and insisted he would pay for the breakfast.

I heard my dad make a serious-toned comment saying "You two should have never got married."

Anyway, he stood up and threatened to fight me so I immediately punched him in the dick.

Since then I've cooled down, realized I made a huge mistake, and have been trying reaching out to my parents in several ways.

I can't help but think that in my parent's world, their son from across the country all of a sudden showed up to their hometown and pretty much immediately punched dad in the dick.
