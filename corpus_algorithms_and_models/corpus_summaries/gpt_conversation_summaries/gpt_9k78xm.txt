For reference, I’m a 27 yr old chick who is not at all rich. I figured most Hilton’s have guest laundry so this shouldn’t be a problem. He goes on to tell me they don’t have quarter laundry but their Hilton does have guest laundry. Me, being the simpleton I am, thinks it’s complimentary. To be fair, HE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT COST A LOT OF MONEY. I mean, based on my reaction alone, that should’ve been some indicator that I was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. Hindsight, of course it cost money. But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. So I go about my day. Get back to the hotel. Get my laundry and thank the girl. As I’m leaving she says, “I’ll just add the cost to your room.” I raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. They charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! Now, I was raised to be polite, so I made sure to tell her I’m not at all mad at her since it’s not her fault, but WHAT THE FUCK??? I’m proud to say I kept my composure the entire time, but I felt like crying. I still sort of do. She gave me the number to her manager, and I sent him an email yesterday afternoon. I’m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.* My job definitely doesn’t cover that cost, and I most certainly don’t have that kind of dough. Not sure what I’m going to do. If anyone has any suggestions I’d be grateful for help.
