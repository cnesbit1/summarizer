He doesn't play well with others that much is clear. And his policies are lifted from Atlas Shrugged (Which incidentally is a book in favour of labour strikes. The original title was "The Strike". Oops) so that's pretty useless. 

The problem I have with AS is it's premise. It takes as a given that industrial leaders are driven by creativity and their wealth is a byproduct of virtuous behaviour.

Clearly we live in a world where greed and the lust for power are important. AS needs more characters like Martin Shkreli and it need to address what to do with leadership that cares for nothing but its own wealth. 

What should we do with old money families who dominate the business landscape but who no longer deserve to?

Actually if MB wanted to get my attention he would talk about that.

For the past nearly 200 years we've had the debate about wealth and poverty, and how to "correct" it.

The truth is, *there will always be a disparity.* It's a fundamental of human nature.  

It's a common assumption that the rich only got to where they were because they are "lucky" or "privileged", and they should share with the rest of us. I think that assumption is wrong.

Is it Maxime Bernie's position that Bombardier should be cut loose from all government intervention?

Given that a Bernier government would have to support this and other industries (in my opinion), how do we ensure we don't prop up failing business leadership?
