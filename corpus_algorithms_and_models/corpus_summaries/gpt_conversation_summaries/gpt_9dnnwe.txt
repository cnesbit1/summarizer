I find it stupid that youths nowadays are using the r-word. all the time.  
The word retard. Its offensive.  
why bother calling it the r-word if you're going to explicitly say retard  
its understood what...very insensitive n offensive.  
1) R-word could mean anything, which means using it in the first place is counterproductive, and which means it needs additional clarification, which brings me to my next point  
2) Explicitly spelling out the word voids the entire point of referring to it as "r-word" in the first place  
its offensive to people who are really mentally handicapped.  
its quite a hot topic in America. people used it in America all the time as a derogatory slur. There were articles written on the r-word.Now its a Singapore thing too.  
i can understand where you're coming from but people are going to continue saying all kinds of things, sensitive or not.  
You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded
