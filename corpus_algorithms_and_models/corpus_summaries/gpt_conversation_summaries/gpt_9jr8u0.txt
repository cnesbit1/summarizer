When I was 17 I spewed on a packed bus. I had been drinking with my mates and one of them decided to just pour a fuckton of Jim Beam into a 2L coke bottle, and I just kept drinking it like I was fine. I swear to fucking God, I heard like 15 people scream in horror as my vomit sprayed them. I quickly rushed through the group, jump off the bus and just ran into the night still spewing and looking for a tap. I felt so fucking bad about it, and it has haunted me for the last 10 years. My brain loves to remind me about it when I'm lying there trying to sleep, which I guess I deserve. Thank you. I felt like I just ruined everyone's night at the time, which was probably true, and I vowed never to get on public transport when intoxicated again, but instead catch a taxi or an uber. I'll never forget the guy in front of me who got the worst of it though. He was in a really nice dark blue suit, and he shouted "what the FUCK mate!", and the look on his face was like I just kicked his dog. Sometimes I just laugh at how unfortunate the situation was though. Nobody won that night.
