Mine is a US based company. That’s why we have flexible working hours, can work from home etc. so long you finish your work. 

I think it depends on the size of the company. I’ve worked for 3 mid to small sized US tech companies and I have a very flexible schedule and can work from home whenever I want to a reasonable extend. 

The downside is my boss expects me to be available at US hours whenever I have to. 

The fact that you worked for tech companies is a much bigger factor here than the size of the company. 

Fine. But you shouldn't be led to believe that is common for American companies, or small American companies. It's common in only very specific fields and unusual elsewhere.
