Only have grab and grab taxi for night commute. Gone were the days of cheap grabshare and grabhitch.  
Well it is true that higher chance of drunken passengers but there are also non-alcoholic that genuinely commute at such timing.  
And they actually appreciate the cheaper alternative offer by GrabHitch or Grabshare.  
Vice versa, hitch Drivers would also like to share petrol costs with passenger that are going to the same places.  
Iâ€™m sure grab could have done better instead of blocking out entire grabhitch service during such timing.  
There's probably very few hitch drivers and riders between 1am to 5am, and a large percentage of rides cause issues.  
If grabhitch drivers don't want to deal with that, can't they just don't log on at that time? (not exactly sure how grabhitch works for drivers)  
If there's not enough hitch drivers, the passengers just gotta take normal grab loh, what's the big issue?  
What they are doing is driving the numbers up by forcing them to take grab taxi which is probably atleast twice more expensive and much more profitable for grab.  
You're missing the point. It barely costs them anything to leave the service there. Infrastructure exists already. It's only a matter of keeping the extra choice for commuters.  
It's just the case of greed. They want your money. They want you to take grab taxi / just grab.  
It's not about getting more people to use other services on the app. It's that the cost of handling complaints during those hours is not worth having it active when it doesn't affect a significant portion of their userbase.  
With or without hitch they have to get home unless they opt to wait for the first train back.  
The same drunk passengers are about to deal with grab drivers. What makes them any less prone to dispute with them compared to us?  
They take commission on GrabHitch so not much cannibalizing. Even if the commissions are higher, how many rides between 1 and 5am on Hitch? They probably were losing money staffing call centers listening to drivers complaining about drunk passengers all night is all.
