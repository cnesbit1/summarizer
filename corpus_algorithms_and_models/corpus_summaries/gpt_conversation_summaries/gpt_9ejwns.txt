Tatar has fallen off lately. Suzuki is a good prospect and the 2nd round pick is a bet at best. I think it’s pretty even value although VGK obviously get the better guaranteed player and their James Neal replacement. I never understood this train of thought. Even though I think this is good for both sides and not a “clear winner” VGK got the best player in the deal. Tatar was a healthy scratch with VGK. Suzuki is a great prospect no doubt, but who knows how he will turn out. The 2nd could be a better player than Pacioretty, but it could also be Patrik Stefan. The team with the better active player wins the trade. Vegas wins the trade. Right now, before the season has even started and Nick Suzuki has played a si gle regular season game, it's really the only metric we have. I'll gladly look at this on new years day and admit I was wrong if Tatar has a great year in MTL and Pacioretty struggles here. Until then, it's based on overall stats that have already happened, right? The fact is Vegas just flipped a player they just recently traded a first 2nd and third for along with their 2nd or 3rd best prospect and a second in exchange for a top line LW. Value wise I don't think it looks for Vegas. They get what they wanted but I think they overpaid.
