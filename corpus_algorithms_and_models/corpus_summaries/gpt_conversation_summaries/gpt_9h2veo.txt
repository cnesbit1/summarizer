I could see Karlsson potentially scoring less. He won't have to shoulder as much of the load, and potentially not have to always log quite as many minutes. 

I'm thinking that adding EK affects Burns scoring more, but who knows. They could both get 25 mins a night and SJ forwards are good, so both d-men could go in the 60-70 range. 

Brent Burns has put up 67, 76, 75, and 60 pts in the last 4 seasons in the Pacific. Karlsson will be able to do it. 

There is still only 1 puck. I expect burns and karlsson to share the load. Calgary had a stacked defence last yr and we saw how that turned out. Not always a guarantee but i do think he will do very well.
