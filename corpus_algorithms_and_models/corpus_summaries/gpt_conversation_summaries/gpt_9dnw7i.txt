The amount of HD hate is insane on this place. But no OP that bike looks dope, I would love to see what all that low end torque does off road, sounds like more fun than a barrel of monkeys. I think alot of it stems from the stereotypes of harleys being slow and heavy, which to be fair os a part of being more touring oriented. But I think the big thing that kind of divides the harley community from the rest of the community is the elitist mentality on both sides of the line. I think the stereotype is less about the bike and more about the rider.. many HD riders tend to be assholes and hate on everyone else, regardless if they are fellow motorcyclists or not. I'm interested in that 2021 naked 975 they're planning but I feel like I'd get a lot of hate because it's an HD, and more so from typical HD riders. I think what it stems from, at least form me is that I'm only 34. I didn't grow up or experience the decades that have made Harley-Davidson legendary. The HD I know is a heavily marketed motorcycle lifestyle in a box so to say. I've worked in this industry for over 20 years. There are douche bags on all sorts of bikes. The main perceived bias against HD is that it's always been more of an image thing than it is a performance or value thing. The biggest problem for HD going forward IMO is, without the image, there is not that much there when compared to the competition.
