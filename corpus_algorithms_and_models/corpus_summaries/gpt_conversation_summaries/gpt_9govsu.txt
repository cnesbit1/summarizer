Yeah, it seems like if something was actually procedurally deficient, they'd be doing something more active than declassifying.
Then why not actually fire Mueller? Why not do something proactive?
Again, why not just fire Mueller and use the documents as evidence? If the investigation is procedurally deficient, why let it keep going? So more Trump associates plead guilty?
So if its a witch-hunt how come Manafort had to take a plea deal? He didn't do anything wrong, right? I mean are you honestly willing to accept the possibility this is not a witch-hunt or are you determined to keep your mind set? My ego can handle being wrong-that maybe Trump and Co did NOTHING illegal or morally wrong regarding Russia. I think you need to ask yourself deep down if you can entertain the opposite possibility-that Trump and Co did collude with Russia in some way. Either way, time and facts will tell. Then there will either call it a witch-hunt/fake news OR admit Trump was guilty and treasonous (depending on the verdict)
Manafort committed crimes. Zero related to Russia Collusion. And really nothing to do with the 2016 election whatsoever
9/11 was an inside job, Mueller is dirty like no tomorrow. What is happening is the truth being revealed actually damage the democrats so badly they need it silenced. Just like Trump, they don't skip a single opportunity to bash on him, and every bait Trump gives them they take it.
So just ignore that an actual conspiracy orchestrated by the Russians to place a puppet in the most powerful office on the planet is actively taking place, and instead think that the effort to remove said puppet is a conspiracy by the deep state. Okay. Because of course.
Trump could just replace sessions. He obviously has no qualms with replacing cabinet members, just replace Sessions with someone else.
Then release it all. Dont cherry pick what to release.
The public outcry over Comey didn't stop anything though.
No, but it led to the Mueller investigation. If he fires Mueller now, he simply gets a new special investigator...
Then fire Rosenstein and replace him with someone who won't appoint a special counsel. Or fire Sessions.
It's amazing how long people tolerate inaction.
People need time to digest the info otherwise MSM's going to spin it as Trump on a rampage.
Lol I'm fascinated by how people seem to just not care about actual action being taken. Trump could reveal that Mueller was in ISIS videos cutting off the heads of POWs, but if Mueller is
