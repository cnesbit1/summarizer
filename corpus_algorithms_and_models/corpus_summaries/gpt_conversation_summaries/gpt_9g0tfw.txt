The price of security is freedom. And making that deal is not betrayal.  
Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.  
It is. The Canadian government sacrifices the freedom of its citizens not for their security, but for power.  
Security and power are the same thing  
But now we get into the debate of what liberty is essential and what safety is long term enough to be considered non-temporary.  
Freedom is power...  
Freedom brings power, power determines security.  
Your freedom or someone else's?  
I'm always curious to know how these "well sometimes we have to torture a few innocent people for the greater good" types would feel if *they* were the innocent person being tortured
