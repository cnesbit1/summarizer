6 weeks ago, my first bike was stolen (CBF 125). This was semi my fault - left it on the road side without a lock at night, woke up to find it missing. Everything was going great, it had a disc lock alarm, a chain, I'd just ordered a cover and I parked it in my back garden, hidden from the outside world behind two big locked gates. Woke up this morning and it was gone. Seems like OP is in the UK, knives are illegal there. Knives? Keeping a screwdriver in your saddlebag would land you in jail in the UK. The best part is that the local police department posted about it on twitter and posted a picture of the "weapons", 2 screwdrivers, 2 pairs of pliers, a pair of scissors, and a file. knives aren't illegal carrying knives around is illegal using a knife as a weapon is illegal and yes if some street yout is walking through peckham with a pair of scissors down his boxers yes it will be seized as a weapon they're not taking spanners out your top box and the guy above said "knives are illegal" which is just not true
