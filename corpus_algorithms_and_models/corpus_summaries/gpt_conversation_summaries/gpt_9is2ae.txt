I wonder if he actually enjoys being constantly groped (not in public, btw. I have some decorum!). 

Do guys enjoy this type of behaviour? We're both very sexual people and we have a lot of sex. 

I think some women underestimate how lonely the world can seem to men. I for one, can't tell if I am attractive. Nobody has ever objectified me in any way and it's left me really unsure of myself. 

On the other hand, I'd say most men would probably underestimate how irritating it would be to have people staring at you lustfully all the time. 

This is spot on. It seems like the whole "dating game" makes it look like a man can seduce a woman through actions and not through "being". 

Most women hesitate to compliment men on their physical features out of fear that he will think we want to be with him. 

I have these same feelings as a woman when it comes to my husband. 

Isn't the same for both sexes? As in, compliments and flirting being a tricky game. 

It's a catch 22, we think you're flirting with us because we generally don't receive compliments from women and we don't receive compliments because [women] don't want to risk appearing to have flirted when they were just being kind. 

I think women feel the same way about men too. It feels like the only time men compliment us is when they want to date or sleep with us. 

I know exactly how you feel. As human beings itâ€™s nice to receive compliments on our physical attributes. 

The sad thing is that abs are one of the few things that a lot of women WILL compliment in private with their friends.
