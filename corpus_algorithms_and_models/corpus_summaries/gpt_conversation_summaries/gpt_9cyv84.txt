It’s human nature. We aren’t biologically engineered to be sexually monogamous. Read Sex at Dawn by Cacilda Jetha and Christopher Ryan. Very interesting, well researched book infused with humor.  
Do you feel as though it's more than just biological engineering though?  
Just because we aren't biologically engineered to do something doesn't make it advantageous.  
Gender is genetic, it's decided when the cells start to form.  
penis/vagina is determined 100% by the combination of sex chromosomes an individual has.
