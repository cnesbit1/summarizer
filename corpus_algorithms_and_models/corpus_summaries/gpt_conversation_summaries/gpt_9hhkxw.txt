>If youâ€™re able to buy cannabis in person, a debit card is a far better option than a credit card from a privacy point of view, since debit card data is processed and stored in Canada. (Cash, obviously, is still better than that.)

Bitcoin is even less private than a credit card, unless you bought it with cash for that one transaction. Everyone can see your wallet activity, everyone.

The problem with bitcoin is you have to somehow aquire it without establishing a link to yourself. Pretty difficult. And every single transaction is logged and public, forever. Date and time.

To be fair, crypto is far less volatile than Venezuela's past currency.

Yes, just yes. Those that I make purchases with using a credit card cannot then trace the history of transactions of that card or where the money came from; only those with special access can. EVERYONE can see wallet activity in the distributed BitCoin ledger.
