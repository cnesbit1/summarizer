Guess what? Telling everyone to blame a whole gender for not being allowed to wear shorts to school (in addition to everything else wrong in their lives) is horribly immature and completely inappropriate coming from anybody with any affiliation to a place of learning. That's the kind of opinion that should be kept to yourself in that situation.

Blame the administrators for deciding that girls' bodies need to be covered. Blame teachers for not properly enforcing it. Blame them for writing and communicating the rules poorly. Blame the clothing industry for making tons of clothing that doesn't meet school dress codes (long shorts have gone the way of pockets in women's clothes). Blame the male gaze for this being an issue at all.

No. Dress codes that unfairly police girls' clothing more than boys' clothing is not the fault of the girls.
