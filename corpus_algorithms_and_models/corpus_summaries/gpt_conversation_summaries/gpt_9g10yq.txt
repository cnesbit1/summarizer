This post is just an image of the room with no context. Nowhere does this give any evidence that a single bullet was fired and nowhere does this give evidence that the computer was hit. Crazy how every time Trump or one of his people do something suspicious pizza gate hits the front page. Also crazy how Trump's connection to Jeffery Epstein is never brought up. funny how Epstein and Trump were photigraphed partying together at Mar A Lago *after* Epstein was alledgedly kicked out. [And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/#) If he found out about the underage girls why didn't het report Epstein to the FBI?  He knew Epstein was fucking around with underage girls and all he did was tell him "you can't come to my clubs anymore" but didn't report him to authorities?  So Trump knew of a felony involving children being raped and he did nothing.  So he's complicit.  Great defense of the dear leader.  You may wanna rethink that one. You're probably being purposefully obtuse, but I'll give you one more reply. He didn't want to be suicided. Lmao. He sure did a lot with that “intel” now that as president he made sure Epstein is behind bars and totally not enjoying paradise on his *private island* in the Virgin Islands.  Ohh wait. So he knew kids were being raped and decided “my life is more important than attempting to help these kids” and did nothing?  Very brave.  What a leader.  And then Epstein was taken down for raping kids years later anyways so apparently he wasn’t untouchable and the fbi was willing to move on him...  basically you are inventing a bullshit scenario where Trump was able to know Epstein was a pedo but also be against it but also do nothing to stop it but also it makes sense for him to do nothing.  This is mental gymnastics and hoop jumping. When asked what he thought about the disgraced billionaire pedo, Trump replied, "he's a terrific guy".
