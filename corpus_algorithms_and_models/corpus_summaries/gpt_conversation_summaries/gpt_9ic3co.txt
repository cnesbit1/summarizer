I just used the throttle lock. Little screw right under the right hand controls  
Harley motors don't idle smooth. Might not stall but it would try to buck u off  
Its because they can't be balanced and the cylinders fire at an uneven rhythm. Its why they sound like they do. It smooths out in its happy rpm range.  
Sorry but he's completely fulla shit. A VTwin isn't going to "buck you off" and they deliver smooth power at idle just like any kind of engine.  
And yes they can be balanced, infact Harley's new M8 had a variant that removed so much vibration and ran so smoothly it was dislike by the Harley croud so much that they reduced the counter balancer mass to give the bike a little bit of shake back.  
At the RPM that an an 883/1200 Evo idles at, it will easily chug along when you fully release the clutch and at a smooth slow pace. It's not going to jerk you around or "buck you off."  
Yes the HD engines produce more vibration than say an in inline 4, but it's not some lopsided motor making giant throws inside of the frame.  
A 45° twin's firing order can never balance. If it fires at 0°, when is the next piston going to fire? That's why they are the way they are.  
So I guess harely pulled some kinda black magic fuckery with their M8 that they had to remove a little bit of balancing from because it was so smooth it wierded people out.
