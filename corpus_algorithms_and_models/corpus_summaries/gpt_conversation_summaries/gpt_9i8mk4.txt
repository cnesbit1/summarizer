I admit I experimented with a couple guys back in college (8 years ago) and she said that that fact freaks her out to much to do anything romantic. I mean really? That's why? I don't know. Not really looking for advice, just had to vent.  
That's the thing. I am heterosexual. It's just frustrating being discarded for trying something different almost a decade ago.  
There are lots of women out there who aren't homophobic or judgmental. Think of this as dodging a bullet! Someone who wants to get to know you for real isn't going to be turned off by your past.  
Lots of bisexual people are monogamous, so that's a big misconception to confront right off the bat. Whether or not someone has had same sex experiences has no bearing on whether or not they'll be faithful to you. Assuming so is stereotyping non-heterosexuals, it's a prejudice.  
Secondly, OP says he identifies as straight- the same sex experiences didn't do anything for him, so it's narrow-minded to try to apply labels to him based on his past actions, if those labels contradict how he describes his own sexual interests now.  
I think it'd be perfectly okay for someone to be uninterested in a romantic relationship with someone based on sexual acts they've done in the past (e.g. group sex, polyamory, casual sex, etc.). You're allowed to have preferences without degrading people or thinking less of them. I don't see why this case is any different.  
You're totally *allowed* to feel that way. Everyone has preferences, whether they are innate or socialized, as long as they express those kindly, there shouldn't be an issue. But this preference *is* based on a preconceived idea about sexuality- it's a judgment borne of homophobic messaging in our society about bisexual people.
