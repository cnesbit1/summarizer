On one side, you have Conservatives accusing Facebook of suppressing information and supporting a liberal agenda. On the other side, you have Liberals accusing Facebook of suppressing information and supporting a conservative agenda. I think you guys are getting played.

If they weren't censoring at all we wouldnt be discussing it. That's the rub.

They are running a business and we aren't the customers. We're the product being sold.

I am extremely *not* envious of the position Facebook finds itself in as de facto arbiter of truth and distributor of news. No matter what happens a substantial faction, or multiple factions of people will be angry at them for allowing the "wrong" message to be disseminated.

If Facebook wants to be a platform for people to say things, it would be unethical (not to mention unconstitutional) for the government to tell them to take things down.

We all knew prior in the leadup to the 2016 election that Facebook was providing each user with an echo chamber based on their stated preferences.

But front page news here a couple days ago was about how Facebook has outsourced their fake news screening to a hyperpartisan conservative blogger.

I agree that everyone's getting played by Facebook to some degree. That's kinda how they make their money.

Interesting. Whether that's true or not, people shouldn't be relying on Facebook for news. It's a platform for sharing pictures, memes, and keeping in touch with friends/family, not a news outlet. People also need to start questioning everything they read.
