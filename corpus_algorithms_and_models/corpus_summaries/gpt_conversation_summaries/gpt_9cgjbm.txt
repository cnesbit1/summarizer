the one place I expect there to be an abundance of ideas allowed to be debated and explored is within a university. You should not be silenced for your ideas, rather you should be forced to back up your ideas through scholarly sources/debate. 

Is there any known cases where schools reject specific views from formal debates? The Ford demand realistically seems more to protect the ability for "racist POS humans" to say what they want, when they want, and how they want. 

In both Canada and the USA, university higher-ups routinely go against the stated policy of their own school when they see fit (often to do with political winds). Just ask anyone who’s ever worked in higher ed. 

If I use a noise machine anytime you speak in public, I am not infringing on your legally protected rights. Under new policy, doing this to you on campus would be need to be against campus rules and enforced. 

I don’t think any “policy” will address what is fundamentally a cultural issue that’s broken in higher ed right now, where even comedians won’t go to campuses anymore. 

In any event, I hope that the government of Ontario does something about the "group think" currently occurring in Canadian universities. Free speech is the backbone of democracy. 

There have been universities that refused to allow certain speakers on campus, and there is a growing trend amongst the extreme left students to try and stifle this speech by pulling fire alarms and attempting to force institutions to ban certain speakers on campus, Jordan Peterson being a prime example.
