At the end of the semester, I traveled around a bit with my (now ex) boyfriend, who was also in Germany for a summer job, but lived in a different city than me. One place I REALLY wanted to go was Trier, the oldest city in Germany, so he and I booked train tickets and planned to meet there for a weekend. Unfortunately, it turned out that Trier wasn't much of a destination (even though I thought it was super cool), so the only train my boyfriend could get would have him arrive at 1am on Friday night, whereas my train got into town at about 3 in the afternoon. No big deal, though, I figured just see some sights on my own and stay up to let him into the hotel when he got there.

I'm sitting in the square sipping my beer, and this maybe mid-30s guys starts chatting with me in English because he's Pakistani. This isn't so unusual, since the whole "backpacking across Europe" thing is still sort of a thing, so young travelers often chat with each other in my experience. I'm kind of uncomfortable at this point, but that's just because I'm an awkward introvert who hates talking to strangers. The whole time we're talking, I'm kind of thinking *"wow, I can't wait for this conversation to end so I can go back to the hotel and Reddit"*.

Once I finish my drink, though, he notices and asks if I'd like to go to a bar and get a drink. I'm a total homebody who doesn't do things like go to bars with strange men, so I decline, but eventually he persuades me to move to an outdoor table at a street-side cafe. *Ok,* I think, *I've got plenty of time before my boyfriend gets here. I'll have one soda pop and then excuse myself.*

Nope. As soon as the waitress comes over, before I can open my mouth, the guy orders two beers- one for each of us. Still, two drinks isn't much. I knew I could more than handle it, and I decided I'd accept the one drink, but no more (not to mention I don't like Pilsners, which is what he ordered. Hefe-Weizen for life.) We're chatting, and he asks if I'm alone in Trier or with friends, so I say that I'm with a "friend", meaning my boyfriend. He immediately follows with asking if this "friend" is male or female, and seems disappointed when I say male. (Yes, in hindsight I should have said "boyfriend
