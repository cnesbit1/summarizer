I (28f) am dating a 29m. We have had major ups and downs due to my self esteem issues, especially with my breasts. He has said a ridiculous amount of times that he loves them, but there was one moment a few months ago where he did say he wished they were bigger and rounder. Anyway, I have jokingly brought up him watching porn. I know I shouldn't have, and I know it's a bad sign, but he left his phone on the coffee table tonight. His porm searches and / or choices of videos also center on what I don't have - "ie massive tits, huge tits, ebony (I'm white), etc". I brought it up to him tonight and he completely brushed off like it was nothing, saying when did I ever say I didn't watch porn? It's genuinely the fact that he lied about it multiple times and then pretends like those words never came out of his mouth, which they definitely did. If he will lie about something like that, what else is he going to lie about? I did try talking to him and asking him questions in a completely conversational (but obviously slightly angry) and he just wouldn't answer anything. The problem is we've already had this conversation and he was still not truthful about it. It's up to you. It's ok to break it off if you think the relationship is going nowhere. Many guys are often afraid to talk about porn. We're afraid of being dumped.
