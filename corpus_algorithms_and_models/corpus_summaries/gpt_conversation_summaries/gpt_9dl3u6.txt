The Wings broadcaster Mickey Redmond also says holy jumpin.  
He also says bingo bango a lot  
I can't wait to hear Mick's voice again today. The Tigers announcers had a physical altercation this week because they hate each other, we're lucky with the Ken &amp; Mickey duo that carries us.  
Ken and Mickey are legit best pals too. When Kens son passed away Mickey was the first person to call him.  
In my sales meeting today, my coworker broke the news about the Tigers guys to us. First thing I said was “Ken and Mick would never do that.”
