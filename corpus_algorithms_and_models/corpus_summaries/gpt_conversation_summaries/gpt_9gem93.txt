lmao did you ever read the post? That's literally what I did, grew up. And when this happened, yes, I was a child.  
Almost as imature as mentally absuing a stranger on the internet who made a post about their fucked up childhood.  
You seem to be really offended by this story so I'm sorry. But please don't act like you know the whole situation from this story that I decided to share.  
I never said his behavior was acceptable, nor did I say he deserves a social blowjob for growing up. That's life and we all do it. That said degrading someone online for something they did as a child is hardly acceptable behavior no mater the scenario. You arent the moral police and have no right to damn op based on this single excerpt of his life.  
So in your mind targeting someone's obvious characterflaw and then repeatably making fun of it isn't mentally abusive? Shit homie, I'd hate to be your friend or family member.
