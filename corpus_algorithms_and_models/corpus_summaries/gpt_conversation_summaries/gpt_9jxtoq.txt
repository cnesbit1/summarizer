Holy fuck give it a rest. Why are you people so obsessed with "Dae Toronto Media"??

I respect the talent of the Leafs on the ice and have nothing against the players or the team, but I’ll be damned if I don’t love the “shit on Leafs” theme here

I made a bad mistake of generalizing all Leafs fans as the same on a post on my team’s sub. I was wrong for that, there are some great leafs fans. Some of the most knowledgeable/passionate fans in the world, however, their pool of ass holes are highlighted more than others, simply because 1. the market they’re in 2. There’s a fuck ton more Leafs fans than any other organization.

Well it’s going to continue to be that way until the media changes. It’s a joke. The bias the media has for the Leafs over their other Canadian teams is stupid. Who would want to support that? It’s fake. It’s boring. And it’s narrowing the distribution channels because no fan wants to be baby fed Mathews and Tavares news 24/7.

You do understand Rogers and bell are the primary shareholders of MLSE, they're going to continue talking about their team. But even before that we are the most talked team, ppl bitching about it gets old when it's not in our control.

Honestly we just need to embrace the fact that everyone hates us and we shouldn’t give a fuck. Full heel.

Fair enough I think we both agree that it's a dead horse, but personally as a leafs fan it's annoying too hear people bring that up in every other thread about the Leafs.
