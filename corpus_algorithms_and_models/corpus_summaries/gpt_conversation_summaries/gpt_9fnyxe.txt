The election of Trump is the single greatest deception ever pulled on America in its entire history. His supporters and his opposition both make him stronger. Trump isn't even a real human being, he's just a reflection of his environment and right now, he's a reflection of the ugly underbelly of America. We're going to find out just how ugly it really is and it's not going to be pretty. See, this is the trick. They are both AWFUL choices. You don't have to support either of them. I support policies, not men. I am on the side of our people and the welfare of the country itself. You can't have policy without a person behind it. I care about his influence on the people of my country and the shared psychosis he has everyone under.
