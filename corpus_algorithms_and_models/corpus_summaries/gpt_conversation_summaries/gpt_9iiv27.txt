Boys were abused at a much higher rate in all age groups compared to girls. Moreover the priests with a single charge against them (the vast majority of the accused priests) had a more evenly distributed gender ratio. Meanwhile what serial abusers (10+ charges) there were had principally boy victims. 

Alter boys spent more special access/time around the sanctuary than other students back when serving was strictly boys only. They showed up early for mass, and help cleanup afterwards. They needed to be around for weddings and other special events. 

Some postulate that many priests went into ministry because they were born gay, and celibacy through ministry was the honorable route to deal with the tendencies. 

Being gay doesn't mean you're interested in little boys. I'm straight and I have no interest in little girls because I'm not a pedophile. 

More likely, pedophiles saw it as easy access to impressionable children. 

It's true, but if you look at gender ratio among abuse victims of a particular population, you'd expect that to change with the fraction of the population that is naturally attracted to each gender.

The celibacy and “high position” probably does just as much to breed pedophilia than attract pedophilia.

I don't think it has anything to do with being gay. The abusers were priests and they're alone more with boys, due to them being altar boys, especially in the era we're talking about. They were who the abusers had access to, so the victims are primarily boys.

The fact that there is no evidence that voluntary celibacy leads to the raping of children.

The John Jay reports found that gay priests were *less* likely to abuse children than straight priests.
