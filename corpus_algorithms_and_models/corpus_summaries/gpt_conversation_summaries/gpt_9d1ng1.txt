Jesus christ these comments are cancer  
Voynov is cancer too though, so it fits  
It's still a dude's livelihood being affected.  
So? This guy is bottom of the barrel shithead. It's no loss if his career is over. He can go work in one of Russia's asbestos mines if he needs a new livelihood.  
Meh. He ruined someone else's livelihood, which in return, gives me zero sympathie about his.  
Edit: the dude kicked his wife in the head, avoided jail time, got deported to Russia where he signed a lucrative KHL deal, won a gold medal and then made jokes about beating his wife, has zero remorse and is trying to come back to the NHL for more money.  
I just don't give a shit if some piece of crap like Voynov doesn't get the privileged life of a professional athlete.  
To be fair, we are talking about someone who was sent to jail after beating his wife.  
There's a difference between him not getting a KHL deal and him getting paralyzed or having a life threatening disease. I'm sure he'll be fine with his $4.1 million networth.  
Have you read the police report on what happened? Because honestly after reading that I donâ€™t really give a fuck what happens to him.  
No: continuing to be vocal about how his behavior was unacceptable is actually the most appropriate response.  
Calling out a wife beater isn't exactly a celebration/fetish, it's kind of just common decency.  
The dude is worth millions he is going to be fine  
The point of this post is to go "haw haw Voynov can't get a KHL contract" and circlejerk over it, which is what's been happening
