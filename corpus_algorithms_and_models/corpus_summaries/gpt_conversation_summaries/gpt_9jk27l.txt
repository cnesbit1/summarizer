Major religion will never die, even in Singapore's secularism. You do realise that the % of religious people is rising globally and the % of atheists is on a downwards trend? In fact Christianity is the second fastest growing religious group, after Islam. That is global or regional data. Islam, Christianity and the non-religious segment have experienced a small rise while Buddhism/taoism proportion has dropped quite a bit iirc according to a census a few years back. Christianity is mainly divided into 3 different big denominations. There's the Catholics, the Orthodox (not a very big thing in SG, but more Russia/Greek), and the Protestants. The Protestants are themselves divided into even more denominations, such as Baptists, Lutherans, Pentecostals, Evangelicals, Methodists, Anglicans, non-denominational, etcetc. Each of these smaller denominations have several small to big differences with each other, but are mainly grouped under Protestants, as their main characteristic (from history) is protesting the Catholic church. People of all creeds and faiths have their fair share of child molesters. While it is obvious that the Catholic Church has to address the misdeeds prevalent in their organization, I don't think it's fair to lump all Christians with Catholics. After all, Protestants are way less organised and have different beliefs.
