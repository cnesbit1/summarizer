No one ever likes pointing out the same people who advocated for woman's sufferage were also the leading advocates for Eugenics and Prohibition, but I think it's extremely valuable to showcase how just because a movement has extremely positive aspects (woman's sufferage) it can also include some pretty gross stuff. 

Also, it teaches us that just because a bunch of academics tell us something is progressive and good, doesn't mean it actually is. 

Hollywood is over here having Asians played by Emma Stone and Tilda Swinton and Scarlett Johansson. Native Americans in film are mostly just Italians or mixed-race asian-Americans. But it's, what, a black Joan of Arc on BBC that's the last straw?
