The action of many have a biased element to it, for one to know what sin is and has a craving for it, is something that has boggled my mind, why would a "loving father" plant the seed of sin in us, expose us to it and made us with a sinful nature, you might say " but we had a good place, free of sin and its effects" I don't understand how though? 

why is hell eternal? I mean how does someone justify that? what good is it to punish some repeatedly for ever? that is the worst thing imaginable and not fair, the judicial system seem more reasonable to me. 

what did Jesus actually save us from? It seems that he saved us from himself...what? why would he go through all of that, create us, create this place, know what was going to happen and then tries to save us? why even create humans if you know that most of them are going to be punished for ever?

if he is *omniscient*, this would have to be all orchestrated, couldn't have been by accident, no chance.

Hell has to be eternal because the Bible is true and it's so, but it also has to be because if it isn't than heaven wouldn't be either. 

The rest of these questions I answer by this : I know God is righteous , merciful, loving, and true. 

We can ask him these questions when we get into heaven, as for now just follow the his word and obey him, and wait till you can ask him yourself.

So if one part of the bible isn't true, none of it is? Yes. It is all true.

If these questions are left with no answer, I'll always be doubting and can't give it 100 percent. 

You don't have to die to find them out. It might takes years upon years of prayer before they are revealed to you. 

If you want your questions answered more than to worship God, I do not know what else to say to you.

How can I worship God if he does not answer me?

I cant worship God if I'm doubting and it is a matter of principles I believe, I have asked for a resolution and he turned his back. 

He will answer you,sometime it takes years though so you might want to be more patient and move on and worship him with the time you have. 

This life is not about getting answers to questions, it's about obeying and worshiping God.

In years time I'll probably have let go. oh wells
