People go INSANE. 

*”But you’re a mother! How can you think like that?”*

*”You must hate motherhood!!”*

And my favorite (and most fucked up one)

*”Why didn’t you abort your own child then?”*

Are you telling me that mothers cannot be feminists and supportive of others own decisions, as well? I hate people!

**EDIT: Guys, when I say "pro-abortion" I obviously mean "pro-choice" I understand vocabulary matters and pro-abortion sounds like advocating the killing of all babies, but that is not what I meant.**

No, women that do abortions are realistic women.

I wanted to be a mom more than anything. We had to try for 2 years to get pregnant.

I had my first child. He was planned. He is happy, healthy and I love him more than life itself.

Incredibly soon after I got pregnant again, and without even a shadow of doubt in my mind I got an abortion.

So no, just being a mom doesn't change your ethical standing on what people should and shouldn't be allowed to do with their bodies and their lives.

Women with children have more abortions than anyone else.

Your reading comprehension needs some work.

I am just as if not more pro-choice since having kids and I let them know during "the talk" that there are alternatives.

All kids should be planned. All kids should be wanted. Doesn’t always happen. But still.

Women’s “health”care. Gotta love it.

HOLY SHIT. You lived with gallstones for SIX MONTHS?! 

You are a mighty woman, and I salute you!

Yeah, the people who argue “well what if *you* were never born?!” to me because I’m pro-choice.
