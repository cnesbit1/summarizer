Hey guys, I’m really excited because I’m getting my first bike in a couple days. Sorry! I’m still pretty excited and forgot to mention it’s a 2008 Harley sportster. I don’t care about the opinions of people who try and make something less fun for others. The irony in the whole "girl's bike" thing is that XLs are more top-heavy than Big Twins, making them actually harder for a smaller and weaker person to handle at low speeds. There's a lot of different Sportster models, which one is it? All of the Sportsters have the same core but the factory remixes the wheels, shocks, and finishes to make different models. The Sportster is one of, if not the oldest continually produced motorcycle. They are also one of the most diverse "families" in motorcycling. I ride a Kawasaki N400 and get this all the damn time, even by people who don't ride. I don’t think one is an XL but it is an iron 883. This one has been modded a little and laid over, but with a little work should be back in good condition. The Iron Butt Rally is a distance riding event where a traffic citation is an automatic DQ and points are awarded for arriving at designated checkpoints on time and riding to various destinations (with photographic proof). The winner usually ends up riding around 11,000 miles in ten days.
