The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals just issued a landmark ruling that found that arresting homeless people for sleeping outside violates their constitutional rights. 

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals recognized sitting, lying, or sleeping are all “universal and unavoidable consequences of being human.” The city is not permitted to criminalize sleeping on outside property, especially if there are no beds available at homeless shelters.

Instead of kicking the already downtrodden by locking up the homeless simply for the act of sleeping, we should be examining our society and how it has failed so many people that homelessness is a massive problem in one of the wealthiest countries on Earth. 

Criminalizing the homeless is particularly a large problem in Florida but this lawsuit was against Boise, a city in Idaho. 

Homeless people are also people, just because they're poor it doesn't mean they somehow become less human.

It is a "problem" anywhere with large amounts of homeless people. They tend to exist in large cities. Large cities are mostly liberal. But they exist in all states, including red states (See: Ft. Worth, TX).

This is only applicable to the 9th court. 

Also this has been addressed in the past. At least in California it’s not criminal to be homeless. 

You just can’t sleep on the streets, sidewalks, etc. it’s a hazard to other people but generally it’s done anyways.

People are homeless in major cities, and in cities with nice weather. This is self evident

Weather has to be the most crucial component

People are homeless everywhere.  I live in a city/County with 66k people (considered small town) and we have homeless people in shelters.  I know because I've volunteered.
