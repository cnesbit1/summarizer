It never really worked, the year Toews and Kane's contract extensions kicked in was the year the Hawks fell off a cliff.  
I mean I'd call a couple first-round exits, including a sweep, following a Cup win falling off but at this point we're just splitting hairs lol.  
You had to pay them for the success they brought you.  
I don't disagree but that doesn't make the cap situation any more manageable.  
Except Toronto is having to pay for the success they could bring. I'd rather be in Chicago's position.  
I mean easy to say that now, but I'd rather have won 3 cups in the last decade.
