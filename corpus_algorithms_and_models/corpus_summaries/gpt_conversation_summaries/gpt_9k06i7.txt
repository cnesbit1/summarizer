I went into urgent care with debilitating abdominal pain and dangerously low blood pressure. I went to the ER where I was given two shots of morphine and an abdominal CT scan. I looked at him and said, “I’m pretty sure my pain diminished because you gave me morphine. What if I go home and the pain is severe again? How should I treat it and who should I follow up with?”  He SHRUGGED and said “I don’t think your case warrants being treated with any prescription pain medication. The morphine wore off in the early morning hours and my pain returned worse than the previous day. Luckily, a different doctor was on call and he immediately ordered an ultrasound. They found my appendix to be inflamed and I was informed that I needed emergency surgery. I was scared, but also relieved that I had a real diagnosis and I wasn’t just being told my pain was “in my head.” I started sobbing again and felt this urge to punch him. Anyways, my surgery went well with no complications and I was given adequate pain medication that I could take at home. I want to file a formal complaint with the hospital. TLDR: emergency room doctor told me my abdominal pain could be due to “depression.” I was sobbing because of pain. Another doctor believed me and ordered more tests that showed I needed surgery. I completely agree. I felt like I was being manipulated. I am so sorry you had to go through this.
