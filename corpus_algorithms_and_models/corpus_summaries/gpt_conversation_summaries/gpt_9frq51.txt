So while browsing this beautiful sub, I was suddenly reminded of the moment I discovered how low I can get as a human being. 

I was 19 at the time and working in a shitty IT helpdesk job. 

My growling stomach and lack of a will to live at that point thanks to my job made the sound of both pizza and alcohol seem erotic. 

10 minutes later and we got a seat and a beer at one of the outside tables. 

We start talking shit, downing our beers, smoking our lungs out and waiting for the pizzas to come out. 

I down my entire brand new draft and feel the bubbles start to build up. 

Being the concerned friend he was, my buddy proceeded to laugh and slap me on my back, hard. 

All over the toddler who was sitting at the table with his family next to us. 

I grab some napkins and try to stand up so I can help this crying kid deal with the aftermath of my poor life choices, but then it hit me. 

First the alcohol, then papa bears fist. 

I lose my footing and I swear my soul leaves my body for a second. 

In a drunken fury I rolled to the side of his pavement-smashing fist and stood up, my rage and adrenaline momentarily burning away the last few beers. 

It lasts about 5 seconds before he picks me up like I was a toy and throws me against the wall. 

I was then promptly picked up by the staff, carried out of the establishment and firmly told that I will be arrested on site if I come back. 

Supposedly after the incident they implemented a "no under 21s allowed unless with parent supervision" rule.
