What? A lot of evolution was worked out before we figured out the double helix. Even in Darwin's time, you could come up with tests that could falsify his understanding of evolution. For example, if you saw newer species in the older part of the fossil record. Another idea would be if you could breed hybrids between two unrelated species. I'm sure that you could come up with other examples relating to things like inheritance, or if you could find evidence for other mutually exclusive theories of the time (eg spontaneous generation of new species), etc.

Also, a lot of genetics and evolutionary biology was worked out well before we figured out the double helix. We already knew that DNA was our genetic material rather than proteins. Mutagenesis experiments were well underway. Even a lot of core population genetics that is still taught today was figured out in the early 1900s.

Evolution was falsifiable before 1953. Jurassic fossils in a Cambrian layer, bam.

Nothing in there mentions the double helix, which was worked out in the 1950s. We knew enough about DNA and mutations before knowing about the double helix to test a lot of ways to falsify evolution in your link.

This may have been true for some people, but certainly wouldn't have been a scientific consensus among biologists.

You're going to compare feminist and Marxist theory, both of which are political hypothesis that can be reasoned against pretty effectively because both are filled with some major flaws, to evolution? Evolution is not political theory and really shares no similarities with feminist or Marxist theory.

I don’t know why it’s assumed that:

1. Marxism is a single ideal when it’s an academic theory with a ton of different applications, and it hardly ever stands on it’s own.

2. That Marxism stands for “pure equality” or whatever that is supposed to mean. Marx explicitly stood against the idea of equality, and instead stood for equity. He didn’t want to make the classes simply equal, through opportunity or material, he wanted to abolish class.

3. That an established academic theory can be disproven by a half assed Reddit comment. Seriously, you can say evolution or science disproves Marxism but that’s not really valid when you’ve shown you can’t even define what Marxism is, and it’s even less valid when you consider science isn’t some homogenous entity that makes final authoritative decisions on things. Can you provide me with a study showing the scientific consensus for saying Marxism is impossible, or can you only
