I guess I was mentally unfit to ride today. Came to a stop at parking lot, put in neutral, *thought* I put the stand down, leaned left, and "oopsâ€”shiiiiiiit!"

That's a good lesson to learn, check your kickstand twice before going for a ride and after you stopped!

Glad you're OK and your bike too (a lever is not too expensive, maybe it's time for a little upgrade ðŸ˜‰)

My bike is smarter than meâ€”it has a relay that will shut off the engine if I'm in gear and kickstand down.

I usally use short and foldable levers on each bike I own. But be careful on what you buy, don't get those weird chinese one you can found and Ebay and Amazon.

I put the bike in first and use the kickstand to turn it off. Easy way so you don't forget to put it down and putting it in gear keeps it from rolling backwards

In my experience, I bought a Ride-It Moto shorty lever and it has a dangerous flaw. I had the brake lever adjusted all the way out (farthest reach), went to tap the brakes on the interstate and found that the brake lever had "slipped" past the farthest adjustment point and was right up against the handlebar... Very poor brake pressure. Guess the vibrations caused it to slip past the adjustment range.

Those are vital organs to your bike, it deserve quality.
