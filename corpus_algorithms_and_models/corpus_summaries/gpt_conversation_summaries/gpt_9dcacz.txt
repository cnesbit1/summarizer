You have to be an individual to donate to a political party. Politicians want to win, and often encouraging 3rd parties that split the opposition vote is a way of doing that. Bernier could steel the Red Tory vote though. Bernier stands to split votes from both the Conservatives and the Liberals. oh there's some deep humor to be had in the 2016 US election. how about the fact that the Comey FBI put off the Clinton investigation to focus on the Trump-Russia investigation, then had to re-open the Clinton investigation literally right before election day, which is basically what made Clinton lose. what's interesting is that in that initial poll that was done about a hypothetical Bernier party, he took 6% away from the CPC, and 5% from the LPC and NDP combined. It's way easier to explain the difference as vote dilution from more people picking a side. Tides funds The Tar Sands Campaign, an international effort that aims to embarrass Canada, deter investment and stigmatize Alberta oil as the poster child of dirty fuel. Clinton lost because she ran a poor campaign and didn't show up in swing states.  She can say it was because of Comey, but he was just the straw that broke the camels back.
