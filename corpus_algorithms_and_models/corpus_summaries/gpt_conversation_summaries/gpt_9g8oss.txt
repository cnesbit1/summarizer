I would say sending unsolicited pics of your cock to people falls into the category of anti-social behavior  
Because men don't face any real social stigma for it. A woman's entire life/career can be effectively ended if the nudes she sent to her boyfriend get leaked. but when guys sexually harass women in texts the predominant response is "well some women like it", "that's just how the dating game works nowadays", "You never know unless you put yourself out there", "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take!"  
Which seems weird as fuck. Like, in absolutely zero organic dating situations would it be acceptable to just get your dick out and waggle it at someone. You'd get arrested or worse and definitely be considered a sex offender, even by guys that send dick pics. I don't understand how they don't see that it's the same fucking principle, the only difference is you can't get pepper sprayed via text.  
It's interesting to note that it works on Grindr, because this reveals why straight guys do it. They assume women are exactly like men, and men, whether straight or gay, like getting pics of genitals sent to them, as long as they are attractive genitals belonging to attractive people.  
Antisocial behavior and being a sociopath are different things though.... right??  
Unsolicited is the key word lol  
If you sexually expose yourself to someone unconsensually you deserve to be made fun of. Has nothing to do with anyone else, just them  
Unsolicited dick pics immediatly cost you any level of respect for your feelings.  
If guys send unsolicited dick pics, you can say whatever the hell you want. If a guy doesnâ€™t want his limp baby dick to be made fun of, maybe he should stop sending unwanted genitalia pics.  
You gotta be fucking joking dude. If somebody on the street whipped out their dick in front of a stranger he'd be charged with sexual assault. Having his little ol peepee made fun of is the least this guy deserves.  
Because when some guy sends you a dick pic out of nowhere it's like a mental assault. You wouldn't go up to a girl in public and pull out your dick to show it off to her, would you? Guys who send dick pics are like 21st century flashers, but instead of people being like, "Somebody arrest that guy, he just showed me his penis!!" Everyone's like, "Oh, it's just a thing. Girls get dick pics. It's gross, but
