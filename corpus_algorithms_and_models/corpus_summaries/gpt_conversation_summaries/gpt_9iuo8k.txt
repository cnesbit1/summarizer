Administrators have to do this when public funding for school keeps dwindling, and schools have to compete against each other for funding via student outcomes.  
If schools used money wisely and not on bloated administration and useless teachers they can't get rid of they wouldn't have mine issues.  
I mean, the federal budget for education was 3% last time I checked. Military? 48%, and that doesn’t include any ongoing wars (war on terror since 2001, etc.).  
Not handing anything in is on the parents and the administration in charge.  
Thank god our new secretary of education is so experienced in public education on all levels - or else we might really be in trouble.  
Seriously? Why do you think that is? It has nothing to do with genetics or single motherhood. It’s the money. If you’re living in poverty you aren’t going to care about your education when you struggle to survive everyday.  
That's a normal exercise for the younger kids ive coached. But it's like a first batting practice thing to get everyone used to foot placement and body rotation.  
I understand what you're saying, bug what we witnessed was a whole practice based on imagined play. No actual balls or bats  
some, its a case of everybody dropping down to the lowest common denominator.  
saves lots of money. makes the for profit charter voucher school look better.
