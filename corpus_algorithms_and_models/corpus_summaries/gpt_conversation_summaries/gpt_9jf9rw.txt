It seems to be worth the effort considering the quotes I've gotten for tire changes in the area.  
I tried one time on low profile sportbike tires.  Huge pain and never again.  Will gladly pay a local shop 90 bucks to do a set every other season when I need tires.  
Yes.  Mount and balance 90 bucks for a set of loose rims.  Independent shop.  Main dealer wanted 160.  
I was quoted $70 for the loose rims brought in.  
Thats a good price.  Worth it.  I had 120/70R17 front and 190/50R17 rear.  No way getting the bead over the rim lip without a machine unless you want scratch the crap out of your rims.  
Nope, without the machine you have no chance of getting that last 6 inches of tire over without scratching up the rims.  
I have a No-Mar machine. Seems like it would be tough even using the bar, just with the wheel on the ground or something. Need some way to lock it down. Don't know, never tried that way.  
Harbour Freight sells a pet good tire stand. So much easier that way.  
Have probably changed 30 tires by now, never scratched a rim. Use a Mojolever.
