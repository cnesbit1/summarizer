I bought a 2016 CB500F a couple of weeks ago, so a 500cc twin, after having just a 125 (single ofc) and I've noticed once the engine is warmed up and running at speed, there is a fluttering maybe even spluttering sound. If I fully pull in the clutch whilst at speed, the noise stops, even if keeping revs up, so it seems the noise is only when applying power and I've no idea where it is coming from or if that is normal for a "big" bike or a twin?? It's 2 years old now so just outside of manufacturers warranty, but the place I got it from has a 3 month/1000 mile warranty. I only just bought mine so is neither :P The chain seemed very dry and tight when I got it, but measuring it's at the bottom end of the slack that the handbook says. I've lubed the chain after a warm ride but it's not helped. I hear the sound from sat on the bike when riding so could be hard to tell where the noise is but it sounds like maybe it's coming from the front sprocket region. The chain is never going to be silent so I would just get used to that if it's coming from there. If its coming from the front of the bike, a rattle near the valve cover, like bbs in a tin can, then it's probably your cam chain tensioner. Also be sure to check the drivetrain chain tension in multiple spots. Chains can develop tight spots and loose spots from uneven stretching. 4000, I've added 100 in the past 2 weeks.
