I'm having some conflicting thoughts on the subject of alcohol, and a bit confused as well. 

After browsing the internet for a bit, there are some mixed opinions on the matter. Which has left me confused and convicted. 

Drinking excessively is a sin, right? There are verses that would argue against that, too, right? 

Is there a difference between drinking to have a good time and relax and drinking for the wrong reasons? 

Knowing my limits, I can get drunk fairly easy. One glass of wine can slam me. 

Am I being selfish, or thinking too much about this? Should I not partake in alcohol, or if I do, be strictly moderate? 

You shouldn't aim to drink until your intoxicated. But having an alcoholic drink is generally an okay thing to do but it will also depend on the situation you're in. 

I think that if the extent of your drinking stops you from being able to enjoy these things then you are drinking too much. 

You need to know your limits and not drink beyond them. 

If while you're staying with your dad he opens a bottle and offers you a glass then there's no obligation to finish the bottle. 

We do drink slightly-under room temperature ale and cider. Which isn't warm as such (about 14 degrees C), but when compared with the excessively chilled fizzy pop that Americans drink, it can be misunderstood. :)
