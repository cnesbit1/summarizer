When I was 18, a boy told me my vagina wasn't tight. For nine years, I believed it. 

Then yesterday, I randomly found an artist on Instagram called Duvet Days. It's all beautiful illustrations representing human anatomy, mostly reproductive. But she doesn't just show standard anatomy, she includes and celebrates variations. 

There's nothing wrong with my vagina. 

Suddenly, I was present. I felt a new sense of wholeness. 

But last night (and again this morning!), for the first time, I felt like an equal participant. I found pleasure in _having_ sex, rather than being fucked. I was able to be in the moment and feel, it was incredibly intimate. 

I feel lighter, sexier, and freer after shaking off a layer of insecurity I didn't realize I was wearing, and it's all because of this art. I think that's what art is for. 

My wife's gynecologist tweeted once about this myth - she said tightness has nothing to do with it. The muscles can tense up to cause "tightness", and loosen to acccomodate anything from a finger up to a baby or two, then return to starting point. 

Many women "tent" when they're really turned on- they contract at the entrance and open up near the cervix, creating a little pocket in the vaginal canal that is the shape of one of those round-bottom chemistry flasks. 

It's a muscle. It flexes and relaxes. No one goes around poking Arnold when he's not flexed and calls him soft.
