Naturally curly haired people tend to want straight hair and naturally straight haired folk tend to want curls. The ads are based on you not the page. The ads for me were travel ads, like some luxury hotspring in Iceland. Not a hair ad in sight! Curls here. Do not want straight hair. Ever. When I was in years 7-9, I had the other girls in school asking me everyday when I'd come in with straight hair. They would offer to straighten it for me. It was exhausting. Just leave my hair alone. When I have straightened it, I hated it. I didn't look like me. My hair is more wavy than ringlet curly these days, but I can guarantee that it's healthier than those who burnt their curls out for years.
