I’m sorry this thread has been absolutely insufferable from leafs fans, just jerking each other off and cannot admit any wrong doings from their team. Like damn it’s bad  
I’m not trolling, I have been enjoying the game even though we are getting our asses kicked. Just saying you guys haven’t been objective at all and are being pretty insufferable.  
I mean it's r/hockey not r/Leafs he (or she) has just as much of the right to be here as you do. Am I agreeing with them? No, but they still have the right to be here and to not be told to get the fuck out.  
They're hyped about their team, man. Kinda sucks sometimes, but I get it.  
No most wings fans don’t even use game threads on here, we were 6-0 before this and weren’t THIS bad. Congrats on the team tho you guys are good.  
Fans of good team say their team is good. More at 11  
On behalf of Toronto, we're sorry for this upcoming season.  
They're complaining about this place but staying.
