It's a joke and i turned 13 last week.  
If this person is saying literally gay, it seems like they are just stating it’s gay, and if they are saying it’s literally fake, it’s a statement about the quality of the post. I think we are all individually responsible for attaching context to the statement. Personally, it seems like they were making a joke.  
If this was 10 years ago we could excuse it as a Ray william Johnson reference. I don't think we can do that anymore.  
I didn't know this was a meme until now and it's still stupid and pointlessly at the expense of gay people.  
He's not. He's saying it's "literally gay" as in it's about a gay pornstar. He's referencing the pejorative phrase "fake and gay" as a springboard to make that joke.  
No.  It is literally gay  
Yikes  
So you might say it's... Fake and gay.  
The joke --&gt;  
Your head --&gt;  
I think you have it the wrong way round.  
Stop being gay
