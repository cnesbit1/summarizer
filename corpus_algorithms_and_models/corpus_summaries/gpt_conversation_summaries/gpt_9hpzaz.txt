Oil/LNG tankers make up about 20% of the global merchant fleet one has to assume that traffic in and out of the ports on the west coast are similar in composition. Are the cargo/container/etc ships also assessed for their ever-increasing traffic and it's impacts, or is this simply a conveniant hurdle being thrown in front of a controversial pipeline? 

Spills are the big concern yes - but one of the specific concerns cited was the additional noise/disturbance that scares pods of orcas and other marine life out of the area, and this applies to other large ships too. 

The job of the NEB is to weigh a variety of pros and cons in making their final decision. They did hold various hearings relating to increased tanker traffic, and concluded that it'd be environmentally harmful and detrimental to the local indigenous population to go forward. Their report concluded: 

>the operation of Project-related marine vessels is likely to result in significant adverse effects to the Southern resident killer whale. 

and 

>the increase in marine vessel traffic associated with the Project is likely to result in significant adverse effects on the traditional Aboriginal use associated with the Southern resident killer whale. 

After drawing this conclusion, they made a choice to exclude all marine traffic considerations from the process of weighing environmental pros vs cons, by defining marine vessel traffic to be outside the scope of their assessment. 

We've determined increasing marine traffic negatively impacts local wildlife. The courts have insisted the NEB has to consider that in their review. 

The question is simple - are other sources of marine traffic also being forced to quantify/mitigate the impact their traffic has on wildlife, or is this a standard only the oil industry is beholden to? 

There is no other source of marine traffic that will compare to bitumen transport, so the answer is no. 5 tankers go through those waters now and that number will increase to 34 when the pipeline is operating. 

The NEB has been operating as an advisory body since Harper's legislative changes. I think these changes were made in 2011 or 2012, not sure. 

The oil industry is not even beholden to it. Only the oil from this pipeline. Vancouver Port just announced record tanker traffic importing fuels from Washington State.
