If he was a fit 22-year-old NSF who knew how to swim and wasn't abused beforehand, wouldn't we normally expect him to be able to survive, especially if someone jumped in to rescue him **8 seconds** after he was pushed in?

I was trying to better understand the surrounding circumstances, including the possibility of his being otherwise "ragged" (beaten up or made to drink heavily) beforehand.

There is also the question of with what severe force and how awkwardly they threw him into the well.

I have now just read the very brief Press Release/PDF and the above are all questions that were not addressed.

Yet not a word about what exactly they were doing **before** he was pushed in (other than that they presented him with a plaque and had some cake) or the severity of the force with which he was thrown in.

I have now read on the [TNP](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/scdf-nsf-who-died-pump-well-could-not-swim) that:

&gt; Mr Kok [the father] revealed that he had found wounds on his son's forehead and cheek.

&gt; Two of his teeth had also fallen off.

He was fit, but doesn't know how to swim

He simply did not know how to swim. And was thrown into the well in a state of panic.

Even a fit, 22-year old NSF who knew how to swim may not have survived.

Knowing how to swim doesnâ€™t save you from a 12m well, nor does it naturally help you to resurface quickly from depth.

The wounds and the missing teeth, all these evidence and you can still feel that something is still not quite right? It's pure bullying gone over the top.

If someone who can't swim is pushed into that well or any other body of water, wouldn't that person be struggling at the surface before sinking?

When people panic in the water they kick frantically this creates a lot of air bubbles directly under them that causes them to sink more and their head to go under.

Also if the SG uniform is anything like the US uniform it feels like it clings to your skin when soaked and that could also make you panic more because it feels like your chest is being compressed and it adds a lot of weight that you have to keep above the water.

I saw some videos of people drowning. The whole thing lasted for less than a minute. Water was still after like nothing happened.

Do the people responsible get charged?

They did get charged

They are civil defence members
