Please be consistent in your beliefs. If you have ever whined about gays and not wanting them in power because you see them as immoral why would you want trump in power (adulterer, lover of money, gossips, doesn't read the bible, go to church, grabs women sexually, etc).

This is the same old tripe that has been dished out for 2+ years. It is purely politically driven and has almost nothing to do with Christianity, except to use it in a vain attempt to give it a whiff of validity. It purpose is simple and clear: Ignore the immorality of the leftist candidate but focus on the immorality of the Republican one. The Republicans could run Ghandi, Billy Graham, or Thomas Merton and the argument would be the same. Find or fabricate a story that shows the Republican did or said something at sometime in his/her life that disqualifies them from serving so of course, if you are a moral person you must vote for the leftist candidate. It happens every cycle, it doesn't work very well, and frankly is just plain insulting. So go peddle your high toned moral platitudes elsewhere, we've had enough of them here.

And shame on anyone for using a Christian forum to sell a political viewpoint.

You spout drivel for hours and demand explanations from others? You come to Christian forum and use words like "s**t" and "fellate" and expect to be taken seriously? You are like a little boy who dropped his diddy in the neighbors lawn and then walked up to the door and demanded cookies. You are a liberal/progressive/democrat shill who came hoping to trash Christians and conservatives at the same time. You deserve no respect until you apologize for your bad behavior and start talking respectfully. So just accept who you are and crawl back under the rock you came out of until you figure out how to act in polite company.

Like all homophobes, you are clueless and oblivious to your homophobia. Go back and read what you wrote. Think about it for ten minutes. Rinse and repeat until you have your answer. Then apologize for all of your stupid and insulting and harassing statements. Then we can have a real conversation.

Are you still talking? Sorry, I dozed off for a minute there. You mean your president too, right? Because he is the president of all Americans.

I've explained what needs to happen for us to have an actual conversation. You dont get to come in
