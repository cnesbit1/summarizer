These past few months have been really really hard. My life at home is really tense and stressful and I started my first year of college a few weeks ago. Having sex with my boyfriend just like.. doesnt happen. I desperately want to but I havent even been able to masturbate. A lot of it I think might have to do with the fact that my parents have weird sexual boundaries with me. A few weeks ago they told me that Im abnormal for not wanting to talk to them about their personal sex lives and that im actively affecting their sex lives in a bad way just for like, existing basically. My mom has also told me not to wear certain things because my dad might become attracted to me. Its likely depression and stress and I feel like moving out would change that completely but I cant do that just yet for financial/legal reasons. Until then does anyone have any advice for coping with this? My boyfriend is very understanding and has never overstepped my boundaries. Hes not forcing me to do anything. If i completely disengage she freak out more and I get extra punishment. My dad usually comes in and flips at me. This will only be solved by moving out. Focus everything you can on moving the fuck out and being independent. The process of planning for it and looking ahead will give you something to focus on besides your abusive crazy parents. I feel so trapped here most of the time.
