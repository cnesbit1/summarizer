A glorious shitshow erupted in ours a few weeks ago when somebody posted complaining about noise coming from the motocross track near their house. The track has been there for like 40 years and dirtbikes are a pretty big thing in our community. We have a huge drug problem in our town (the NYT even did an article about the burgeoning heroin epidemic in rural California that mentioned us specifically) and a lot of people love that they can get their kids into racing that gives them something nondrug related to do on weekends and over summer. There's always those people. We had one complaining about air traffic. Very little sympathy for her when you have to drive up to the direct perimeter of an Air Force base in order to enter the neighborhood. "Can we do something about all of the aircraft flying overhead???" "Like what?? Close down a military base or do you mean shut down the international airport? Why did you buy a house here?" It's a bunch of people. You can only ignore them. If you try and explain that this is their livelihood and how these people make money, they try to turn it on you with a lecture on being a good community member or "they volunteer all the time for HOA projects!" I mean, not to be a downer but if there's a burgeoning heroin problem in your town then there's definitely drug deals happening at those Sunday races.
