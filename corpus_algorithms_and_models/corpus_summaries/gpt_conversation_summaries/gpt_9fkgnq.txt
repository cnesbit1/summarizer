A psychiatrist is a physician who specializes in psychiatry, the branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, study, and treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are medical doctors, unlike psychologists, and must evaluate patients to determine whether their symptoms are the result of a physical illness, a combination of physical and mental ailments, or strictly psychiatric. There are hundreds of thousands of people who lead functional lives and also have mental disorders, I feel bad for you if you reduce people on such a base level. If a person is seeing a doctor for multiple sclerosis you don't consider him a bad person, but you also don't consider him a candidate to be a fireman, because he's physically weak. Oh, I'm just mocking the all-too-real attitudes of the so-called "christians" who jump at any opportunity to kick the man already down, mock the needy, and revile the meek.
