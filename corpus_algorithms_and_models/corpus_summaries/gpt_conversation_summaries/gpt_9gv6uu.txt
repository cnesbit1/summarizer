And my soul is crushed. How could i not see this? How could i be so stupid to believe the late nights and work trips and every strange thing he did i passed it off as my being paranoid and possesive. 

My whole entire family was fooled. Holidays. Birthdays. He met my father. He talked about our future his future. We had fucking plans. 

How do you do that? How do you live a double life for two and a half years. How did she not notice? How could he ruin so many peoples lives 

Most of all why do i hate him but still love him. I know he is not him. Not the man i loved. That man was made up. A lie, all of it fake. But that fake person was everything i wanted. I told him how lucky i felt every day. Every day for 2.5 years. 

Holy freaking crap you guys. 2.5 years. I put every peice together. I know where he was now on certain nights. I was the other woman. And this poor girl is married to this horrible person. This poor girl. 

Edit: the wife knows. He was in the navy and she also told his chief so theres probably going to be some funnstuff for him there. 

But most of all thanknyou all for everything youve said. I came here because i needed to get my feelings out and i didnt expect so many people to have similar stories. How can SO MANY people do this? 

Ive been a single mom for 3 years. He is not the father of my child. So if it was anything related to parenting thats why. My ex was there but in the end i was on my own to raise my son.
