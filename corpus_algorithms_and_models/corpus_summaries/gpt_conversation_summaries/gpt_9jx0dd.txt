Being gay is *not* a behaviour. It's simply the state of being exclusively attracted to ones one gender. It doesn't matter whether that person has ever had sex, it doesn't matter whether they've made a lifetime commitment to celibacy--*if* they are exclusively attracted to other men or to other women, *then* they are gay. Period. And sexual orientation is obviously not a decision you make.

Again, being gay is *not* a behaviour. I've already educated you on that point. It always amazes how much trouble you people have understanding this simple fact.

As a gay person. It is not a behavior. We donâ€™t choose to be attracted to the same sex. Get it through your head.

Being gay and having gay sex are two different things. How are you still not getting this?

You cannot change your instincts but can control your behaviour...

Which means that someone can't control whether they're gay or not. You're *so* confused.

A person can take no ACTIONS and still be a gay Christian. The word "gay" has literally zero implications with respect to a person's ACTIONS, so it doesn't any sense to talk about ACTIONS when one is asking the question of whether someone can be a gay Christian.

No, that's stupid. It's just a simple fact that being gay isn't a choice. That's all. Anything else you've imagined is just an invention of your hysteria and moral panic.

By Christian Theology and teaching, straight people must be monogamous or abstinent. By that same teaching, all gay people or people who have that instinct, must remain celibate.
