yes. some people are not glued to their phones these days. I get home from the gym at 7:45, probably dont look at my phone again until bed time. im 28.

I think you need to just relax a little bit. Heaven forbid they are just busy or thinking about their answer before replying...

You see, the thing is that going on a vacation is not something you decide casually. It takes time. I usually reserve such conversations for the end of the day when I'm free and can devote my time to the topic. Meanwhile during the day, I fuck around doing whatever I like. Casually.

You are being kinda crazy here. Analyzing all these factors and counting the hours is a little oppressive. Maybe he is in mixed company and can't really devote time or thought to a full response, but can casually check facebook for a moment. Or literally anything else at all.

Hey. Relax. What are your hobbies? Get on it. It'll get your mind off of it. Update us as soon as he replies.

Here we go. Your 'him not replying' problem solved. Cheers. Don't try to overthink such situations from now on. 

Yeah, crazy how people can go on with their lives while still contemplating their answer to something. Just because my gf asks where I want to go to dinner and I dont answer but still post stuff and reply to other people doesnt mean I hate her? lmao. it just means i dont know the answer to her question yet.

he is...what I can assume..a young teenage or early 20 year old dude. he is not reading any more in between the lines of it than you think. He is either going to say yes or no, not judge you for asking in the slightest. that is 100% you over thinking it. Just relax and let him get back to you.
