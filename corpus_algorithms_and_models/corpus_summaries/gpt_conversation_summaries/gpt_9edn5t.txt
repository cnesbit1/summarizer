Hey, guess what? You went into shock! Your body thought you were gravely wounded and bleeding out, so it plummeted your blood pressure (which gives some people intense nausea) in an effort to slow your death! Sounds like you need to find another donation center because everything they did (making you stand up at all, blowing out your vein, telling you to down a gatorade, waiting to put you on an IV, etc) makes me think they didn't know what they were doing. Glad you're ok.  
Honestly, I was so stressed out reading about how bad the nurses and doctors handled everything  
See, the issue with these places (the one I go to and have seen reviews for) is that the people handling these needles are ***not*** medical professionals.  
Former CSL Plasma employee here.  
A lot of the phlebotomists have actually taken phlebotomy courses and some are certified, but you're right, it isn't a requirement.  
The medical staff employees, however, are always at least LPNs or paramedics and should've known how to handle OP better.  
I have no medical training whatsoever and that didn't sound right to me, either.  
I worked in a plasma center for about 8 months. The impression that I got from my time there was that it was the most incompetently run place I've ever worked  
You may have had a vasovagal response, where the body preemptively puts you into shock because of perceived injury (needle moving under skin, knowledge that blood will be leaving your body soon). Can come on stronger with lack of sleep and dehydration, for sure.  
I worked as medical staff in a plasma center and have some exactly what you have done. Smaller people are especially susceptible to having a reaction, but it can happen to anyone. It happens a lot on people's first donation, once you do it a few times it usually lessens.  
Reading this original story made me very concerned.  
If you tense your abdominal muscles or squeeze your legs together, it helps your blood pressure to remain elevated. It takes practice, but people have been able to get rid of the vasovagal response by training this way.  
Current phlebotomist here, it can sound intimidating but the experience is almost always uneventful. Most cases the reactions come from new donors because they donâ€™t always know to eat before hand. Drink a literal shit ton of water the day before. Eat a good healthy meal about an hour or so before coming in and that
