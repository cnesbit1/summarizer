I (30F) just started my cycle today (hooray! my birth control is working) and maybe a few hours ago...this surge of hormones rushed through me and I immediately wanted sex. Thing is...he doesn’t like period sex, which is fine, no qualms there. However,we have a sexually open relationship so, I do have one or two play partners I’ve kept around. But...none of them are into period sex. Which is why I came to Reddit to vent my period-hormone-induced-need-for-sex frustration.
