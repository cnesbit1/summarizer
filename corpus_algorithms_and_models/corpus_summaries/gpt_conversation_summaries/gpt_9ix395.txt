Dragon Prince,Trollhunter

And the best reality TV show, Terrace House

Yup first season is the best and has the most drama though it kind of fizzled near the end. 

Opening new door is better than Aloha but In the City is still the best,Hansen is still MVP. 

The first season is supposed to be the best but Netflix never got the rights.

Boys and girls in the city and the latest one, Opening new doors are must watch. Aloha state is just too much unneeded drama but it still has their moments i.e LAURENNN and basically anything with guy.

Watching BGITC now but I finished Aloha State first. Taishi has the craziest arc, going from most annoying to straight up being the protagonist of the season. It’s very satisfying, I fell asleep at almost all the episodes before he arrived.

Guy is also an amazing character. He got the full Terrace House package, as awesome as OND’s Shion.
