But his profile photo is sideways, leading me to believe he doesn't know wtf he's doing.  
Navigate to the photo you want to flip, click options in the bottom right of the photo. Rotate left and right are the 4th and 5th options down respectively.  
This is a real special case worthy of study.  
I think I need to open it on PC and not mobile to fix it.  
I don’t see why they think that is okay!  
When I used tinder I would put my picture sideways so maybe it would make me seem more interesting and weird so they know what they’re getting into.  
Any time my FB has done that on mobile, I needed to update something. App, software, something. So, maybe that?  
Did you take it on a iphone? Open the image in paint rotate and reupload  
I must be friends with you because I saw this on my news feed about 20 minutes ago, don't remember who you are though. That old bearded dude is creepy as hell.  
There is probably some courses near you. You can look on google maps for courses or facebook groups for leagues around you.  
You probably have courses near you and don't even realize it.  
Omg fellow disc golfers in the wild.  
What is disc golf?  
Throwing frisbees into receptacles  
Like golf, but throwing a Frisbee into net things instead of hitting a ball into holes.  
Wow $22 is way less than I thought to get into this hobby. There seems to be two courses somewhat near my city so I'll see if I can give it a shot  
Do it! Great low cost hobby. Lost of courses are free to play or under 10 bucks. Great way to get outside and TONS of fun.
