And I think we also denied the sale of choppers to the Philippines when we learned it will not be used for rescue, but for war against terrorists down south, saying itâ€™s against human rights.  
Eh, I replied but deleted it because it seems that things changed. We are shipping them AFV's with weapons? That's new. Fuck that, I don't support shipping them weapons or ammunition. The vehicles is one thing.  
Regardless if it is or not, we can control NOT giving our weapons to someone. The arms industry can shed all of its jobs for all I care, if it meant that we aren't exporting death to literally the worst countries. At least in the news, you don't see us selling stuff to democracies like Estonia or Ukraine, our govt. is giving to the shittiest of countries (at least not the Philippines).  
If people have to be oppressed, it should be done with Canadian hardware and not any of our competitors. These people will be oppressed one way or the other, we might as well take the jobs.  
This is not fucking aid, they are paying cash.
