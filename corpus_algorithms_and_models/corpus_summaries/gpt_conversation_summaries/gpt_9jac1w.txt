Melnyk would likely sell to Joe Spano so long as he got his money up-front.  
Melnyk was offered 600 million for the team from local Ottawa buyers and he turned them down. He wants LeBreton more than anyone in the world. Moving the team is not even an option for him. It's either commit to LeBreton and then sell the team as a package, or sell the team now to some businessmen in Ottawa.  
There's a lot that goes into sales. Jim Balsillie tried to buy a couple teams as well. I just chose to make the punchline include Spano because he was a known fraudster.  
Obviously people, such as Melnyk, are affectionate toward their possessions even when others, such as the fans, don't believe they're doing the best with them.  
You never heard about the Sens plan to move to downtown Ottawa? It's pretty common knowledge at this point.  
What's my problem is that I have to hear people constantly talk about my team being relocated, and that the fans sticking up for their team will increase those chances. It's annoying, and I'm sick of hearing it.
