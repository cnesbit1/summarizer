No, it's not relevant. A post about a random woman doing something that has nothing to do with her gender isn't relevant. I might as well post about a woman on the bus blowing her nose or something.

&gt;I have an article showing a woman behaving badly, why can't I post it here?

&gt;We get it, some women are assholes and do really shitty things. This isn't the place to discuss the shitty things some women do.

&gt;This space was not created for us to try to answer why some women are bad people, nor how to deal with them as bad people. Lots of women are bad people (just like lots of men are!) some are liars, some are violent, and some are just straight up jerks. That sucks but there are many, many other places on reddit where that can be discussed, this isn't one of them.

Men get probation for rape too. Is it because they're men?
