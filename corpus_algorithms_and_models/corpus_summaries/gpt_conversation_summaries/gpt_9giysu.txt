This occurred around the time I turned 17. The budget was tight, and all I could afford was Ol’ rickety. For the enthusiasts, this was a 68 F100, rust in color with olive green shining through in a few areas. 

“Well she’s no panty dropper,” The haggard prior owner told me, “But she’ll get you from A to B most of the time. Don’t try to make it to C though”

Young and naïve, I was actually excited for this arrangement. I shelled out the $500 and drove her home. The absolute first thing my new ride needed was a cooler steering wheel. $40 at a parts store and a hacksaw later, I pretty much had a racecar.

“This *thing…* is NOT safe to drive.”

“Yeah I don’t think it’s going anywhere.”

“Does it even have insurance? Where’s the license plate? Is it... registered?”

“That’s literally where I was headed sir.”

“Well… get it fixed first.. Jesus! And do I need to
