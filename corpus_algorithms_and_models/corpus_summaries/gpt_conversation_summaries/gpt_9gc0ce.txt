Say what you want about the Arizona Coyotes, but I believe in their current state, they're a team on the rise. However, I think it would be better for the league and the sport as a whole if they won the 2015 lottery and selected McDavid. Edmonton had too many fucking chances and they bumbled most of them. A generational talent like Connor McDavid would have been a godsend for a struggling franchise like Arizona. I'm not a Coyotes fan, or a McDavid fan, rather I'm a fan of seeing the sport grow. Arizona is finally gonna be a good team, and I'd love to see them succeed and finally turn the corner. Proof the lottery is not rigged. If they rigged it McDavid wouldn't be in Toronto. Toronto is going to make money regardless of the roster. You're forgetting the exchange rate. Canadian teams don't make nearly as much money for the league because of it. This shows that there is 5 Canadian teams in the top 15 in operating income and 3 in the top 10 and thatâ€™s all after exchange rates.
