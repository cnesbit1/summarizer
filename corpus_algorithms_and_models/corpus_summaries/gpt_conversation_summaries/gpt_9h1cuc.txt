There are 4.7 million opioid users in Canada, and there were 3,996 opioid-related deaths in 2017 (these are not limited to overdose)

Even if every death was someone with an opioid prescription, which is not the case, that means that 0.08% of them overdosed and died that year

There are 25 million people in Canada with a drivers licensed, and in 2016 160,315 people were injured in a collision with a motor vehicle, or about 0.6%

Transport Canada's National Collision Database (NCDB) contains data on all reportable motor vehicle collisions in Canada that the provinces and territories provide each year.

The issue is a lot of people start on legit prescribed opiods but when the prescription runs out the cravings are still there so they go buy off a street dealer because its cheaper and dont need s prescription.

Among Canadians who use opioid pain relievers, about 2% reported using them for nonmedical purposes.

The 2017 Canadian Guideline for Opioid Therapy and Chronic NonCancer Pain reports that opioids are associated with a 5.5% risk of addiction

Imagine if some alcoholics were suddenly dying more often due to their buying *poisoned* bootleg hooch that was *illegally* purchased on the black market from criminals

Claiming that opioids are killing Canadians is like claiming that bullets are responsible for the death of people murdered in gang wars

We are seeing a rise in the number of deaths among opioid addicts who have bought drugs illegally, drugs that are adulterated with fentanyl, and not among prescription opioid users who do not abuse their medication and are not addicted

If we legalized these drugs, or provided prescriptions for addicts, we could end these deaths overnight
