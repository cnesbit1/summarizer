I love Reddit and I generally love the people here, but lately I have been feeling largely like I am intruding on a community that doesn’t want or respect me. It’s starting to feel more and more like Reddit hates women and has no problem attacking women like a mob. Especially with the Kavanaugh hearings, I have been astonished at seeing almost every single top comment about the subject being in support of Kavanaugh. I’ve been going through posts and comments all week and feeling like I don’t belong here due to the men expressing their desire to defend rapists.

I am just curious if I’m the only woman feeling this way lately, or ever. I feel like there is no point in even commenting on these matters because the men of Reddit will attack me. Her point is that there is an overwhelming amount of very defensive men (with regards to sexual assault, who effectively attack even allegations which is effectively but probably inadvertently akin to taking a pro-assault stance). Most of all these men lurk specifically on women subs. "Reddit hates women"
