The outcome of this could be big. 

These are BAD business practices because it normalizes everyone into a statistic instead of focusing on individuals and the product. 

They can sell their data on you to other companies, countries, etc, to where there is a worship of sorts to get this data above all else. 

Above their product development, above innovation and THIS IS WHAT IS STIFLING CREATIVITY!!! 

Everyone is an individual and analytics are an excuse to narrow the buying choices and views to what (((they))) want. 

It always gets abused to cut out the creative music, creative films and documentaries and it is now a heavy form of censorship. 

But it's based on "buying choices" of the marginal. 

In a few generations of buildup and usage, these companies can completely wipe out whole portions of history just with the censorship of certain books, films, TV and media. 

This is a DANGEROUS practice and the next form of thought police. 

Creativity is the ONLY thing that matters. 

Analytics and market research are very bad at **predicting** trends and innovation for they are lagging indicators and only tell you where you have been, not where you are going. 

True Engineers, Artists and original thinkers have a very high skill set, which is necessary to implement their original ideas. 

They use these skills to push the paradigm further. 

The world is getting more unique everyday and things are changing. 

For the most part the average Joe six-pack lives in a pigeon holed existence.
