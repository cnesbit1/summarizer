Recently I made the decision to stop shaving my legs (smoothness only lasts about 3 hours for me and I always get razor burn) and jeez Louise the comments I have gotten from people are insane. Funny thing is, they’ve all come from other women. 

Why do people care so much about a woman not shaving her legs but don’t bat an eye at men not shaving their legs? I don’t get why people care about another person’s body so much

Lol, unless you *chose* a profession where you need to do these things, you don't have to. The social pressure eon men to shave is far, far, far, far lesser in magnitude that the social pressure on women to shave. 

Are bearded men present in your everyday life? In ads, in leadership positions, in general? Yes?! Okay, then men do not have hte social pressure to shave that women do, highlighted by the fact that very, very, very few women who don't shave end up in advertisements, leadership positions, are are not visible in society.
