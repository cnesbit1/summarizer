What about that is a conspiracy theory?  
You didn't answer my question you expanded it.  
Why don't you save us some time and paste in what portion of that source pertains to this sale or is it the earlier sale?  
Ya but wouldn't that be pages and pages of material and I would have no idea where to look and thanks if you post a copy paste later.  
Thanks you trickster, I thought you had something specific about the magazine sale, I have found out this, Koch money behind the 8 months ago sale, and the buyers are Democratic supporters.  
I found that very interesting.
