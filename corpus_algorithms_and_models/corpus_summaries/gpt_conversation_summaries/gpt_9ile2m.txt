Faith Goldy literally recited the 14 words, but the *Star* is the one dog whistling?  
Well she appeared on the Daily Stormer, a prominent neo-nazi publication  
And she loves her 14 words.  
She's also advocated for Canada to be 'white' again.  
Yes.... thatâ€™s what you guys say *every* time someone openly acknowledges their own Nazi viewpoints, lol.  
The context is her being dared to say it by a neo nazi, then she does.  
The person who dared her was a neo nazi podcast host, not "the media."
