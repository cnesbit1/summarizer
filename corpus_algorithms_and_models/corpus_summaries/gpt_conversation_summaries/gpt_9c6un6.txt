I feel so guilty about this but I simply don't believe in God like I used to. I despise going to church because of how strict it is. My whole family has to get up at 4am and attend church from 5am-10am. Not only that, but we have to stand 95% of the time. Every Sunday, I'm exhausted, bored out of my mind because it's in a language I don't understand and self conscious whenever I sit.

I fear that if they continue to force me and pressure me to go to church I'm going to end up hating Christianity.

Christianity is not a fire insurance policy..

He SAVED me from Eternal Flame and torment, and Gave me ETERNAL LIFE!

If God is Love, he cannot also be worst than hitler..rethink your theology... its not good news, if billions of others will spend in hell because they didn't say the "sinners prayer"

No one is saved by saying a prayer.  You are only saved by BELIEVING in JESUS, who died for all of your sins on the cross, was buried and rose from the dead!

God Loves the Whole world, and He has provided the ONLY means of Salvation for mankind through Christ Jesus!

The Gospel is the Good News, and is the Power of God unto Salvation, to everyone who Believes it! {Romans 1:16

There is Great Punishment for all unbelievers awaiting them.  But God is full of patience and mercy and doesn't want anyone to perish... But He Must be true to His word, and sin will be punished.

Time is running out!
