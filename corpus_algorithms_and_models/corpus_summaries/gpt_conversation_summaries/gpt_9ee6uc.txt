The prices for the vet seem ridiculous.  
Pet insurance is vital for this exact reason; most of the time it's a small expense but sometimes vet bills can be insane.  
My dad was paying for everything insurance didn't cover, and apparently the dog's medical bills were by far the highest.  
As a dog owner I can say they are. Pet insurance is a MUST  
My cat got her feet mangled in a trap last week. Emergency vet=$150, next day amputation and follow up care=$1000.  
I have a pet wellness plan through Banfield pet hospital and recently had a $6000 surgery done on my cat for free (I pay $45ish a month and this was the first month, we had only paid $45ish at this point)  
I don’t know why people consistently devalue the amount of medical schooling/education that the veterinary profession requires.  
Think about it this way; doctors and nurses only have to know about one species but vets have to know about all sorts of them and their patients can’t answer questions about their symptoms.  
Which is why pet insurance for young animals is well worth the price.  
Yes, actually everything went well, everyone's fully recovered by now
