Thou shalt not kill.  
Killing in war is murder.  
If God orders it, then its not a sin.  
Killing is wrong, period.  
You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. (Matt. 5:38-39)  
Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. (Matt. 5:43-48, Luke 6:27-28)  
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. (Matt. 5:9)  
There are many pacifist denominations that hold to the idea that war no matter it's justification is wrong and sinful.  
Kill and Murder are 2 separate words with 2 separate meanings:  
"The Hebrew word for “murder” literally means “the intentional, premeditated killing of another person with *malice*.”  
No, the Bible said that killing someone who has killed is justified. Killing just to kill is sinning.  
Even the Pope has suggested that the death penalty is wrong.  
God didn't write the Bible, men did.  
Men wrote the Bible, inspired by God.  
In more than 3000 places the Bible declares itself inspired (2 Peter 1:21).  
There are many denominations that consider the Bible to not be the inerrant word of God.  
No, He carries out his wrath through people, against people who have killed.  
Did God approve of the innocents slaughtered by 'Christians' in WWII, Vietnam, Iraq etc??  
But didn't God order the killing of innocent Canaanites in the Bible?  
Canaanites weren’t exactly human to begin with.
