Ehh talk to some devils fans about Price.  
Do devils fans still hate price because of that palmeri incident?  
I remember on a favourite player thread some devils fan showed me a clip of the Palmeri incident.  
You actually think Price overly tried to injure palmeri, as apposed to letting out furstrsting and just sending a message? Genuinely curious.  
Watch it again, he took one head shot and three more blows to the lower back....what was he trying to do with those lower back shots??? Give him a few bruises??  
You gotta be kidding me if you think Price tried to injure him lol.  
I honestly can't even think of one NHL instance where a guy tried to deliberately injure a guy. Even the Todd bertuzzi fiasco was an accident; although it was reckless, I highly doubt he was trying to injure him.  
Same goes for price. If he wanted to injure him, there's so many other things he could have done than throw a few blows to the lower back lmao. I've never seen a guy injured from that before, ever.  
Maybe price was just pissed off? Did that ever cross your mind? Same emotion that you'd see in a regular fight when guys are taking shots at each other's faces? You think every time somebody punches another guy in the face, he's trying to injure him?  
You're insane if you think ANY hockey player ever tries to hurt another guy intentionally. Like I asked you before, can you name me ONE instance where a guy deliberately tried to injure a guy and succeeded? Good luck finding any examples because there simply are none.  
Nobody out there is trying to injure other players. You're delusional as fuck if you think Price was trying to injure palmeri here, and there have been WAAAAY more contraversal/dangerous hits than that example.  
Dude maybe those guys were bad examples, mayyyybe, BUT I still think price was not trying to injure palmeri with some weak ass lower body punches lol.  
Again yeah those guys did some fucked up shit but I wonder how much of it was pure recklessness rather than "I am going to break your arm! I will break your knee, that is my goal!". I really to doubt they think that way when doing shit like that  
I gotta push a hard disagree. I can accept that rotten-soul Bertuzzi didn't straight up intend to just end a career, but he was going in there
