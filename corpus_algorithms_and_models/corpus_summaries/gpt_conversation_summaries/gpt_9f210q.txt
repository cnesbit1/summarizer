There's a difference between offering less because of cap reasons, and offering less because of being broke. The Lightning's pitch amounts to "take less because we are unstoppable and you will win multiple cups" while Melnyk's is "take less because it's all I have". If Karlsson signed for $10m AAV in Ottawa, he'd be making $4,684,129 after taxes. If he signed for $8m AAV in Tampa, he'd be making $5,074,310. That may or may not have something to do with it. Tampa has the advantage of not being a complete shit show Taxes, possible huge winning window, beaches, golf courses and also what matters the most: pirates lol Lol, Karlsson will make more money at 10m per year with tampa then 12-13m per with Ottawa. Taxes is a big advantage, especially with his contract most likely heavily in contract bonuses. From Ottawa, it is a lowball bullshit offer from cheap ass melnyk. Ottawa has the worst tax rate in the league (tied with Toronto). Tampa is tied for the best (with the Panthers, Vegas, Nashville, and Dallas) It's well documented that guys can lose almost 50% to taxes It wouldn't be the reason he left. It would be a reason he would consider taking less money from another team than he would from Ottawa. He can accomplish the same take home pay on a lower AAV in other cities. If he would prefer those cities to Ottawa and those teams can only fit a certain AAV under the cap, he might take a lower AAV there in order to achieve the same take home pay.
