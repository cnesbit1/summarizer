Me informing you that everyone experience harassment online is somehow me being a jerk. What a joke lmao  
But it happens to women at 5x the rate and it's different harassment based on their gender and gendered stereotypes.  
Yep. Women are harassed *for being women.*  
Everyone gets harassed online.  
Multiple studies have shown men face more harassment online, though women face more sexual harassment.  
"Overall, men are somewhat more likely to experience any form of harassing behavior online: 44% of men and 37% of women have experienced at least one of the six behaviors this study uses to define online harassment."  
"men (30%) are modestly more likely than women (23%) to have been called offensive names online or to have received physical threats (12% vs. 8%)"  
The same study shows that women experience far more severe harassment and are targeted based on sex.
