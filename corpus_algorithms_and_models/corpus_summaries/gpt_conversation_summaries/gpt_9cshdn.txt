I think you have the wrong number  
Who’s this?  
"nice name tho"  
"Nice name tho lol. Pic?"  
"Nice name tho Iol. Pic?"  
"Nice name lol. Pic?"  
Holy shit! It’s Bigfoot.  
Definitely get that pic!  
I bet of all entities bigfoot would get the most requests for dick pics  
I'd imagine he'd get the most requests for full body pics  
Lots of people are into feet.  
He could be swimming in money and DMs.  
Poor Ethel...  
I don't understand why OP gave an anonymous stranger her real name. She could have said Bill or something.  
I met one in high school, and she *hated* it. And her parents for giving it to her because the other kids tormented her over it. Changed her name as soon as she was legally able to.  
Kids will make fun of anything. It was mostly because she had an "old lady" name, but there were some superman related jabs too. She's much happier with her new name.  
Because being married to *fucking Superman* would just be the worst...  
Yeah it would actually. Not only is there the super villains that would target you to get to superman, but there's always the chance that he forgets humans are fragile and kills you. I'm sure there are other downsides, but those two are reason enough.
