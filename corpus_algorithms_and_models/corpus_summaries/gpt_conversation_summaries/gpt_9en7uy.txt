The manufacture of Agent Orange was well aware of its horrific long lasting side effects on humans. Now it's being used on virtually everything we consume.  
The story of the [Times Beach Superfund site](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Beach%2C_Missouri?wprov=sfla1) shows how seriously the EPA takes Agent Orange applied in the US. They bulldozed an entire town and spent the next 30 years incinerating the top 12 ft of soil.  
Tell that to my dad who literally got the VA to cover his cancer expenses because of exposure to Agent Orange  
My dad's got cancer and Parkinson's from agent orange exposure and is considered 100% disabled. He also gets his medical expenses covered by the VA, as both diseases have been proven to come from exposure.  
How would they not know?  Anything that's so highly toxic and effective at destroying plant cells is clearly going to have significant similar effects on human cells, as is now a grotesquely proven fact. The US government approved its use because they were well aware of its long lasting affects and they could play the plausible deniability card exactly as they have. And now the same government and herbicide manufacturer are soaking everything we consume with a commercialized version of it.  
Our farmers use large amounts of this herbicide to quickly kill their entire crop before harvesting it and feeding it to us. Where is there a difference beyond the fact that the Vietnamese didn't have a choice whereas we willingly allow it to be done to us?
