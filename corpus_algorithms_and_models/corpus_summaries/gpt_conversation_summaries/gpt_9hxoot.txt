As many people say, nobody cares about NS outside of NS. But what do y’all think?
No one gives a shit whether you were an officer, spec, or man post NS, only how long you will be away for your reservist.
This is incorrect. Some companies (eg. Cisco) will specifically ask you to state if you were an officer in the SAF during job application for some of their positions.
Still,it hardly makes a difference in job prospects.
Heard numerous stories of men in NS being bosses of officers who were in the same vocational unit as them.So your rank in NS doesnt really matter much.You may be inefficient/unproductive in the SAF doesnt mean that you are a useless asset to other organisations.Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses,which varies from person to person and thus different companies will capitalise on those with the unique strengths certain people have,with little or no regard for how they fared in NS.
Well, the comment says no one gives a shit. So I’m just pointing out that some companies do care. I am not an officer and I agree that it doesn’t really matter.
If you want to join Cisco as a Management Associate, the requirements for males and females are the same, with the additional requirement for males is being a Commissioned Officer in SAF or equivalent in HomeTeam.
Plus officers and specs often get called back a week earlier.
thats why so many talents go overseas work till they’re 40.
