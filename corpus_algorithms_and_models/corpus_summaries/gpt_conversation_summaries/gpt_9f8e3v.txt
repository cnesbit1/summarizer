I was terrified to share it; what if she thought I was gross, disgusting, thought less of me as a person?

But finally, a year and a half ago, on my birthday, I just told her.

Now, about once a week or so, she'll kill a couple bottles of water we'll toss down towels, and she'll squat over me.

It's pretty fantastic. And would never have happened had I not just talked to her about it.

If he's willing to make himself vulnerable enough to share that he wants you to fuck him in the ass - knowing the sorts of stigmas society likes to attach to this kind of thing - I just cannot imagine that he would judge you for wanting pee play.

You have to respect boundaries, of course, but that doesn't mean that you can't talk about them.

Good luck to you!

As a man, I think that if your husband is willing to trust you with the "ultimate surrender" then peeing is relatively tame.

I love the enthusiasm in most of this comment; it was probably unnecessary to mention your personal disgust.

This is an incredible (and warm!) testament to the benefits of good communication and of course a wonderful, adventurous sex life. Bravo, sir. Bravo.

Well, there ya go.... that's the spirit! ....and you're right (and very logical) to look at it from that approach, always look for the "positives" in any given situation.
