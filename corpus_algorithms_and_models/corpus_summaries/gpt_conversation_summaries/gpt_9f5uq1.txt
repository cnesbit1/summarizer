As the article points out, as does the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, the rate of abuse among those with opioid prescriptions is less than 5% and the rate of addiction is between 0-3%

Of the many *millions* of people who have an opioid prescription in Canada, virtually none will ever ~~shoot heroin~~ become addicted and use illicit drugs

No, it doesn't, it comes from CAMH, CCSA, Health Canada, and our own Senate report on opioid addiction

It also comes from over thirty years of study on heroin addiction, reaching back to the Vietnam War

The public has this notion that a significant number of legitimate opioid users become addicted and it's simply not true.

Interestingly, medical practitioners form a large proportion of the small "normal folk" segment of methadone patients.

Whether or not people inject heroin, drink methadone, snort hydromorphone, or smoke opium the truth is that it is incredibly unlikely their addiction began with a legitimate prescription

No, it very obviously doesn't, and we have literally decades of studies from here and around the world that clearly and empirically proves that - you can't just make a claim like that with nothing but your own bullshit to back it up

If you look at the actual amount of opiods used by prescription by gram of morphine 90% of user with a script use 10^ of the opioids and 10% of the chronically injured, sick, dying use 90% of the opioids.
