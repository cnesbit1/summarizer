The entire party is corrupt and no one associated with it (now, in the past, or in the future) should be allowed to be a government employee or lobbyist of any kind. No murder necessary.  
Not a great recent track record. Trump, Moore, Porter, Manafort, O’Reilly, Ailes, this list goes on. At least the Democrats held Franken accountable, Republicans never ever do and usually smear the victim in the process.  
And yet you're fine with a president who is the poster child for sexual predators and who nominates sexual predator supreme court justices  
Then vote against people who commit it. Unless you’re all for the grab-them-by-the-pussy president, in which case you are totally okay with sexual assault, you just want to claim that you’re not.  
Have a *republican lite* party form. Then when everyone votes, the majority seats will be held by this new party and the Democrats. The current republicans will be pushed into obscurity.  
Yes. I'd ask why they're supporting a president who is a sexual predator.  
Republicans seem to be protecting members of their party abused of sexual assault while Democrats are more likely to throw that person under the bus so to speak. Republicans have fought tooth and nail to defend these guys to a scale that you don't see from Democrats. I mean Republicans talking heads and fox news. The establishment, etc. Not necessarily all constituents (though lots of them).  
Hope it implodes and is reborn as something more reasonable  
Remember when he not just admitted, but bragged about committing sexual assault?  
Accusations of sexual assault certainly haven’t been deal breakers in the past few years, now have they?  
If you aren’t “aware” of any already you’re not talking to me in good faith. You’d have to have been living under a rock to not know about the Roy Moore situation. Sean Hannity defended him. Republicans were saying shit like they’re be fine with him pursuing their teenaged children. You know damn well what I’m talking about.  
If “grab them by the pussy” doesn’t equal “I am ENCOURAGING sexual assault” then I don’t know what does. Come on.  
He bragged about sexual assault. That is not debatable. Grabbing someone's genitals without consent is sexual assault.  
The vast majority of victims do not stop forward because it's generally an additional traumatic experience on top of the original trauma.  
If? He was banned from a mall
