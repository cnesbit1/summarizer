Stars have had jersey issues in the past. I remember watching that game as a kid. I think it was because Fleury got a bunch of blood all over his jersey, the refs tried to kick him off, so he grabbed some fans while he was walking to the tunnel? They probably have extras with - but not with names on them. If he realized he didn't like the fit early on during warm ups, they may have had time to quick make up one, but during the game it's a bit late. A few years back during an All Star game, they had the names on the jerseys, but not the C/A patches, so they were frantically sewing them on before the game - the Packers equipment manager (huge hockey fan) was there and they pulled him to help get the jerseys ready right before they had to go on the ice. Well for that one the Stars were marked as the road team so we brought our whites, while the Panthers were on a road trip so they also only brought their whites ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ He's (Red) really close with the NHL guys - He's from Canada and I believe he may have been an equipment manager for an NHL team forever ago. There was a piece of equipment that he basically introduced the NFL to, and now it's in the NHL because of him..... And on the opposite side, the NHL used some uniform sanitation equipment that Red introduced to the NFL. He's an insanely interesting guy - I first met him because he walked up to me out of the blue, handed me his Super Bowl 45 ring, introduced himself, told me to take some pictures and he'd be back for the ring in a bit, and walked away. In the end, players swap jerseys mid game all the time, but they may not have had Radulov’s spare with them as it was a preseason game.
