When we have a documented, hate sub, that incites violence and encourages brigading and harrassing other users, not even get banned, it is obvious what is really going on with this shitty social platform. Reddit is dying the death of a million shills, fake gate keepers, and paid discourse. Anerica has become a political battleground that is filled with censorship and divide and conquer strategies. If Reddit is stifling you, why not find a more "open minded" site? because social media has been monopolized Then make your own! I cant, social media has been monopolized... Monopoly of the people? Yes, most people would not no to a conspiracy site. Or do you mean they'll kill you if you try and make one? Buy servers? Set up databases? so you see the problem then they'll stop you from being able to compete Is it possible to create something as popular as reddit with zero budget?
