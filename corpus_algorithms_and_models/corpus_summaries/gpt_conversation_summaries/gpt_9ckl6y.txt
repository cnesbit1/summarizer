Canada post used to be amazing, but that was before the massive funding cuts under Harper. It sure looked good on the budget for that year, but now everyone is paying for it with reduced service as less people did more work across the board.  
Isn't Canada Post a crown corporation funded by its operations? I can't find anything about funding cuts.  
What's really annoying is now they fucking deliver your package then send a bill in the mail for duty fees, which all seem to have gone up lately.  
Canada Revenue Agency used to be amazing, but that was before the massive funding cuts under Harper. It sure looked good on the budget for that year, but now everyone is paying for it with reduced service as less people did more work across the board.  
That's CBSA (customs) and/or the seller's fault, Canada Post doesn't have anything to do with duty prices. They pay the duty at the border to clear your package, and then send you the bill to reimburse them.  
There are some vendors on eBay, etc. that will include duty/tax in the purchase price, but otherwise it's a crapshoot whether or not you'll get flagged at customs.  
I believe the funding cuts were in reference to the changes to community boxes over home delivery. This would have allowed them to basically let a bunch of people go, since it is much quicker to drop mail off in one of those than walking to each individual house. and then back to the vehicle.
