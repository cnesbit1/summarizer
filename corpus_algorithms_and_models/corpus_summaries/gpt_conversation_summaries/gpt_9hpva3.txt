Some people enjoy it, others dont :)

Some boyfriends enjoy it, others don't.

This place is extraordinarily progressive. It'll offer advice on scat if you want it.

If I were a betting man, Iâ€™d say it would be 95% about what your diet should be and how to best clean up after. The other 5% would probably be ideas of what to do during. It sort of feels like the kind of fetish that, if you enjoy it, you already know HOW you enjoy it.

Personally, a 9/10. Eating lots of fruits, especially pineapple, can affect the taste of your cum.

If you expect someone to someone to allow you to cum in their mouth, it's common decency to at least know what it tastes like.

Diet-wise, it's good to experiment with your S/O to find what foods result in the ideal outcome. Me, personally, I find consistency very important, so my S/O will eat a lot of foods like oatmeal/applesauce/potatoes, and other such things that have a nice consistency. Those things, along with a lot of fruits (especially pineapple), diet soda, pudding, and marshmallows give the "outcome" a very pleasant flavour and smell if that's what you're into. Other than that, the obvious being a high intake of water, enough fiber, and to stay away from foods like onions/red meat/etc.
