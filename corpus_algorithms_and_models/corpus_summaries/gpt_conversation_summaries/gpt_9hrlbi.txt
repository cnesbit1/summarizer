So illegal immigrants get an all expenses paid stay here in canada while their claims are processed, but we can't even properly look after our veterans? Makes me sick 

Those illegal immigrants shouldn't be ahead of anyone in line for government funds. Even more insulting, most of them are found to have had legal status in the Us, further proving that the bulk of them are merely asylum shoppers

It's not either-or, but when's the last time you heard conservatives saying we needed to do more for the poor and homeless except when complaining about refugees?

If the anti-refugee people weren't the same people always cutting social programs that, y'know, help the homeless, maybe I'd care what they thought of money we could be spending on the homeless.

You still havent refuted the argument that illegal crossers shouldnt be getting money before vets.

Because it's a stupid argument. Vets do get money. The amount spent on refugees is insignificant compared to vets.

Not enough to cover their needs. They are even denied service dogs.

The Federal government alone has spent over $120 million on illegal crossers, that would go along way towards meeting Vets' needs.

Also, why should non-Canadians get any money while there are still Canadians in need?

It's not a zero sum game. We can spend enough on veterans, take in genuine refugees, and process and deport people who don't prove refugee status.

We don't have enough to properly cover veterans' needs as it is.

Why are you bringing up refugees ? Are you trying to conflate illegal (irregular) immigrants and refugees for political advantage ?

Veterans are not at this point denied service dogs. The report only was handed in seven weeks ago. It takes more than seven weeks for any government department to make a decision.

Canadian military veterans don’t only have support from Veterans Affairs. We also have access to the public service health care plan and pensioners dental services plan.

Don’t use an issue concerning veterans as a way to promote anti-refugee hatred. This is not the Donald. We don’t need hate speech in here.

There will always be Canadians in need. There will always be people who struggle. That doesn’t mean we leave thousands of people to die in horrible conditions just because they weren’t born here.

So...any issue where the government might need to do better is an excuse to complain about immigration?

People don't need to be conservative to care about the law and veterans.

Do better? What do you even mean? They cut funding and say they can't afford to pay what the veterans
