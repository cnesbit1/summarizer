Bit of background, I have been on medication for almost a month now for mental health issues and one of the side effects is insomnia. 

I woke up this morning after 4 hours of sleep, and I have a maths test today and I am struggling to stay awake as is. 

Almost at school now and I have downed 3 of them and I down another one om my way in. 

About half an hour into class and I can't sit still. 

Fast forward 30 minutes and I am sitting on the toilet writing this, with 2L of V Energy in my gut. 

Even better thing is that I looked at the can and worked out how much caffeine I had consumed... 620mG of caffeine in under 2 hours. 

EDIT: I survived the day. 

Started coming down from all that caffeine after about 4 hours. 

My resting heart rate was 160Bpm and I felt really sick. 

But hey I stayed awake during my test so mission accomplished. :)
