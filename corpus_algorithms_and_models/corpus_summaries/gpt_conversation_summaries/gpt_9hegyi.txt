But the reality is that the repeal of 377a is based on consent. That's the qualitative difference, and therefore won't lead to a slippery slope. Slippery slope is only valid when one thing is a more severe version of another thing, when there is a quantitative difference but not qualitative. Regardless of how deviant or not you think gay sex is, that's not the point. The point is that all consensual sex should be allowed. If we remember that children and animals cannot give consent, then 377a has no implications on either of those things.

I agree. And the more we normalize healthy gay relationships the less deviant it is culturally and the less the slippery slope will be a concern. I dream of a day where gay teens stop committing suicide and are free to pursue first crushes and learn healthy relationship boundaries the way straight kids are idolized for.

Slippery slope is one of my most hated logical fallacies next to the strawman.

It is important to note though that slippery slopes are a thing. It's a fallacy because it's not always backed up. You can't just anyhow say one thing leads to another, but it does happen when the only difference between the supposed cause and effect is magnitude or severity.

Gay relationships are not normalized in the US. Great strides are being made *legally,* but gay pride parades are essentially a celebration that they haven't been beat down yet. They are part music festival, part protest, part celebration, part group therapy outreach, and a huge beacon of hope to those who feel like surviving one more day in a homophobic world is just too much. Suicide rates are still very high among LGBT+ folks, especially teens. Equality is a marathon, and it's not near done, especially for minority persons, especially regarding social violations such as bullying/harassment, assault, child abuse, workplace discrimination, etc inflicted on persons suspected of being gay or trans.

It's funny how mental health professionals advocate for less discrimination to help with mental health outcomes when you're arguing for the opposite. Why is that?

The 377a have more significant impact that you think, it is withholding the legalisation of same sex marriage, applying flats and laws to prevent homophobic discrimination.
