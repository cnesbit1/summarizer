You’ve never been run off the road by an Ontarian driver who doesn’t use a blinker to switch lanes.  
I like to say our politics are downstream from America. Sometimes our MP's cite American statistics to argue their policies, if a mass shooting happens in America people protest here for stricter gun laws, etc. It's why I follow American politics as closely as I do, in addition to the fact it's generally more grandiose and interesting.  
This is true almost everywhere. The vast majority of people just want to go to work, raise their family, enjoy their weekends.
