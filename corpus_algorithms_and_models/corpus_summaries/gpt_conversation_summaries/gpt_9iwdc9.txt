You may not know about it (I barely ever see it in English media), but Qu√©bec is currently missing over 100 000 workers, and that number is growing daily. The province has been creating jobs for over a decade in wake of the 2008 crisis, and we are currently trying to recruit outside of the country, but not a lot of focus is being put on Canadians. You do need to speak French in most cases, but if you're ever feeling like moving across country and starting over, it's a pretty good deal. Some regions are down to 2% unemployment, they'll hire just about anyone who can walk straight and count to 10. Furthermore, cost of living is quite cheap, even in big cities, and if you're thinking of getting a higher education, it's quite a bit cheaper here than in other provinces. I'm not here to convince you, I'm not a recruiter, not here to start a debate about if you should have to speak French or whatever political argument there could be about all this, just putting it out there. If you have any questions, I can probably answer a lot of them (I do work for Employment Insurance, so although I have no personal interest in the matter, I do know what I'm talking about), and you're always welcome in r/Quebec or r/Montreal / r/quebeccity.
