You joke but when my wife momentarily left her phone at the Target checkout and the guy behind her stole it I tracked it to the house- and the police *asked* if it was there. Her leaving it for a moment on the counter meant (per the police) that they had no probable cause to enter the house as it was not stolen, just in their possession. 

Target had him on camera grabbing it and walking out - but my wife (again, per the police) was not in possession of her property when it was taken. 

Sigh.
