After a couple hours of banter I started feeling my gate to the nether weakening and I knew it was time to go make a deposit into the toilet so I politely asked to go to the bathroom, a completely normal thing to do right?

They informed me that the light in there was broken so I was just like whatever I'll use my phone as a flashlight to make sure no brown substances were remaining on my crevice.

After a few wipes, the scariest moment of my life occured.

I saw a black snake like creature wrapped around my hand, and my brain immediately thought I was infected with some kinda anal superworm.

In my instinct driven spasm I somehow broke the toilet seat and my ass fell into the fucking toilet.

After about 45 seconds of searching for the little shit I started coming to my senses.

The black, slithering, slimy, snake like worm wasn't a parasite, it was my hoodie string.

I opened it to see the faces of a family that won a free trip to a zoo, but got tricked into going to an insane asylum.

I feel terrible. I broke their toilet and obviously need to compensate them for the damages, but I dont know if I can ever see them again without having horrible flashbacks. I truly am a lost man. I will never be the same.

TL;DR I thought my hoodie string was a parasite from my anus and broke my neighbors toliet.
