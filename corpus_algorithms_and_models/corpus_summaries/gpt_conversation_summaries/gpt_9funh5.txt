I wasn't the most accepting of the idea of him being gay for the longest time, and while I changed my mind quickly, I'm very thankful I didn't irreparably harm our relationship before I did. Anyway, my son has a boyfriend (James) and apparently they've been dating since March, though I only discovered this last month. Regardless, I happen to know James well, and he's a very nice boy. I never would have suspected either of them were gay though. Both do sports, (James is on the football team), and neither is feminine at all. Which I guess goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Anyway, my son told me that they're both "out" to their high school now, and have been since the start of the school year (they're juniors). I'm was (and still am) a little worried about bullying or intolerance, but we live in a fairly liberal and a quite large city, and I am lucky enough to have a great job that I love that allows us to live in an affluent area with great schools, and they don't tolerate bullying for any reason. And I've come to realize that God, righteous as He is, surely would not punish my son for something beyond his control. I have educated him. He knows right from wrong. He's a good person. He's nice to people, gets good grades, is liked by his peers and was chosen as junior captain of the swim team. He doesn't smoke or drink, and he's always respectful.
