School resource officers are police officers stationed on a school campus. They do have the authority to exercise their duties on campus just as they would out on the street.  
A protest is one thing, however in a school, not following the directions of teachers, administrators, and/or police officers, is considered a disruption of the learning environment, and can (and usually will) result in various consequences.  
No, the unlawful thing was for her to start yelling at people. It is within the law for the school to enforce dress code, and give consequences for those not following it.  
A shirt that says “turn you on” is most definitely not within the parameters of any school dress code. Also, if that is her shirt in the picture, then it is breaking the dress code by being see-through. You can see through the letters.  
I’m not disagreeing with you on the fact that the dress code is ridiculous, but yes, I think the school can keep her from wearing a shirt that says that. However, there is a place to address issues like this, and the way this mother and child handled it was passive aggressive and irresponsible.  
Again, I don’t agree with the actions of the school admin either, but they were still completely within the law with their actions.  
And there have been many other cases after Tinker that help define what political speech is in school. I don’t think this is even close to qualifying as that.  
Realistically they'll reach a settlement and no precedent will be set or changed here.  
If I were the admin, I probably wouldn’t have said a thing, let the student have her say, and she probably would have dropped it eventually. I don’t think that it was a good idea for admin to push the issue, but I do think they were within their job responsibilities to do so.
