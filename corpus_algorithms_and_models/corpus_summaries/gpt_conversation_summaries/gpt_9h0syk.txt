'What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law. For I would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."'

The OT is not 'irrelevant', we are just not bound by the Law of Moses, and are now under the Law of Grace. But as Paul says, the Laws of the OT are still morally important. There is also much wisdom to be learned from the OT too.

The United States is not Israel, Canada is not Israel, Brazil is not Israel, Germany is not Israel, France is not Israel, There is only one Israel and its the nation it is today. In Israel, you’re damn right it’s still relevant to kill homosexual men because God condemned it. Most Christians don’t live in Israel, that’s the nation where Orthodox Jews live and other Jews. I’m Messianic though

Now, there was one point on Earth when God set up a specific government with rules telling people to punish some sins in some certain ways. That was ancient Israel; the rules are part of the Law of Moses. That has since passed away. Jesus refused to impose those punishments in John 8, and we - who are no longer under that covenant - should definitely not do so now.
