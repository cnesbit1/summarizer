If there's a reason, then it's fine. If he just doesn't own a car, then it's bye boy. I live in the burbs; you *need* a car here. Ubering everywhere is just a huge waste of money.

That's fine and I most certainly have in the past, but that doesn't mean I'm interested in a guy without a car.

In smaller cities, especially in the western regions, not having a car is a huge problem.

I have my own car as well. It's a necessity in places without relibale public transit.

It depends on where you live. You said that in your response.... If you can't see beyond life in the 'burbs, that's probably why people downvote you.

Ok.... But the burbs is where I live. Thus my answer is tied to that.
