A dual front, regular bike with the famous inline 3 Yamaha engine (850 cc, 115 hp), even experienced riders think is extraordinary.  
I think that anything that creates more or unusual interest in powersports is a net win for the industry.  
I think it's a very cool bike.  It's got its pros and cons, of course, but at the end of the day it's a step in the evolution of motorcycles.  
The good thing about these designs is the greatly reduced risk of head shake and better contact patch in the front, improving front-wheel(s) grip on the road (reducing the chance of the front end washing out from under you, which is hugely difficult to recover from on the street)  
The german version of the testing videos in the alps, had some semi-pro Yamaha Cup riders have ago and they were quite happy with the bike, especially considering the usability for normal people.  
The NIKEN is fun and can be considerd a mature bike, while the MP3 is a safer city-surfer option.  
With two wheels in the front the bike can slide a bit, where a regular bike would just produce a low sider. Lose grip in the front and you're down.  
I know people who were bitching about ABS, then cornering ABS, then traction control and wheely control and blippers and now they have a 2018 Fireblade and it is just so good to have these MOTO GPâ„¢ electronics to really USE the power of the bike.
