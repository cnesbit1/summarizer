Screenshotting text notifies the other party??  
This is Snapchat  
I have taken a screenshot of things I never even plan on showing or looking at again just to ruffle feathers.  
I think they updated it and that still gives a notification, rip secret screenshot techniques  
You can use that screen capture feature on the Samsung phones and it won't notify them. I forgot what it's called, but it's the one you can swipe in from the side of your phone.  
Wana know a little trick that I use for snap? Just open your open apps tab (now idk if this works on android) and just take a screenshot of the tab. U see a lot of the convo and u can move it up and down and hold it in place while positioning the tab. No notification on their end. I dont know if it works with pictures too but I would imagine it does.  
You can screen capture on Android using capture plus and it won't alert  
Or just use a video screen recorder, snapchat doesn't pick up on those. Save the video, play it and take a screenshot of that. None the wiser.  
Snapchat DOES count screen recordings (at least the built-in one on iPhone) as screenshots. My SO found this out the hard way trying to screenshot some cringy shit.  
I heard snapchat works very differently between ios and android, plus I used a 3rd party screen recorder, nothing native. Perhaps that's what made the difference?  
There's a lot of screen recording apps out there. Kill snapchat, start recording, open snapchat and then go to messages or watch that lewd snapstory picture. DL to computer and just take one frame.
