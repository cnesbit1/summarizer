A few weeks ago I matched with this girl on Tinder. Even though I had no intentions with her whatsoever, I had a bit of a vulnerable moment and we ended up making out. FFW a couple of weeks. I got a job as cabin crew at a major airline (can't say which one for obvious reasons) and my training just so happened to be in the same city where she lived. Even though I had no intentions with her, eventually the tone of the conversation turned sexual. Eventually, we made plans to do the deed at her place. Suddenly, while giving me head, she says, "According to your height your penis ought to be larger." I was *mortified*. I am absolutely average size-wise, and I know I have no reason to be self-conscious about it, but I won't lie when I say this wrecked my self-esteem. I can 100% empathize here. I'm a tall dude (about 6'1") and I also have an average dick. Then comes time for me to take my clothes off. Bam. She looks at it, frowns and says "it isn't as big as I thought. Most taller guys have bigger dicks." She tried to still have sex with me but after she said that shit, I was so annoyed, I couldn't even keep it up. Moral is: All people have preferences and that's fine but if it's that big of an issue, there's a nicer way to say it. What made me feel so lost was that literally no-one else had ever said anything even remotely similar. People are always going to be critics. There's nothing you can do about it other than say fuck you and stop talking to them.
