Thank you. I think I posted here because I need people to share my outrage. I’m not sure really. I’m just trying to be supportive and not overbearing.

My husbands plan is to video everything at the game tonight. Especially the behavior of adults. And go from there. Maybe it’s just all talk, but it has niece scared.

I don’t really love the idea of harassing someone right back. We don’t have plans beyond Keep niece safe and have video evidence of anyone doing anything wrong.

So far so good. Football star’s family has kept quiet during half time. They’re going to get her out of there as soon as the game is over. Hopefully without incident.

Already checked the states recording laws. Good to go. I’m not sure if we will even post anything. So far the video camera seems to be deterring any poor behavior. One more quarter of football to go.

It’s a public space so almost all states allow it. But this state also allows audio. We are good.

To be honest, coming from a small town that's pride and joy is football this wouldn't surprise me. Regardless if anyone knew the victim or the abuser, people will get upset that the star player is gone and blame the victim. Couple that with the abuser being popular and the result is larger harassment of the victim.
