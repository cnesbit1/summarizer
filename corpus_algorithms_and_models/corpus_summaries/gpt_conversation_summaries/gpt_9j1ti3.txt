So sheepish were Disney and Mighty Ducks officials after the performance, they declined to identify the entertainer who portrays the Iceman. They issued statements about "company policy" barring the release of the entertainer's name and said, in effect, that they preferred that the Iceman remain the Invisible Man. One Mighty Ducks official even said he couldn't confirm or deny whether he knew the Iceman's true identity.

He's an experienced musician, a grandson of Academy Award-winning actor Wallace Beery and a North Hollywood resident. At his day job, he plays keyboard for Disneyland's Tomorrowland Terrace Band. Strongly advised to keep his name and face a mystery, he asked The Times to protect his identity--not an unreasonable request given the week he has had.

The Agoura High School graduate said he hopes the Iceman returneth.

"Afterward, MacKelvie sat in his car and cried, something he says he hadn’t done since seeing the movie “E.T.” He was, to be sure, The Crushed Iceman."

I was at this game. He would appear in the stands to cheer up the crowd and the best he could come up with while Anaheim was getting killed was, “We scored!!! Then proceeded to try to sing Break It Down Again by Tears For Fears while being mercilessly booed by the crowd. Either his mic stopped working or they pulled the plug and Wildwing took to the ice and people were happy again. What a night.
