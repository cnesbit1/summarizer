All of America needs better highway infrastructure and much better driver's education. And we all know we can't depend on other drivers to not hit us, so we need to be more cognizant and not hang out in dangerous portions of the road. The idiot cops around me, stop people in traffic lanes all the time despite never being more than a few hundred feet of a parking lot. People are allergic to stopping and taking a second to assess the road and a merge lane seems to give them the excuse to just not stop. Conversely, people love to come to a stop in the merge lane to assess traffic before merging from the right about 50 MPH slower than traffic. It drives me insane, and is definitely not safe. Man, I don't even think it's common sense, I think it's a total lack of real driver training. Florida? Written test from a booklet which only covers road laws (Which, I didn't study for, passed) to get a permit, and an EASY driving test to get a full license. Crazy people. But also we need to stop calling it the fast lane, it promotes staying in that lane if you feel like you're going fast, which sometimes is not the case.
