My girlfriend and I have been dating for 7 months, and for the first 4 months we had a very active sex life (at least 3 times a week depending on schedule). But since mid-May she became depressed and we haven’t had one single sexual interaction since. I’ve been extremely understanding about how her depression killed her sex drive, but it’s been so long. Now she started taking Prozac, which we know kills libido even more. Her Prozac is really helping her have good days again, so there’s no way I want her feel bad for taking meds. When she wasn’t depressed she was always ready for any sexual intimacy. She understands that it’s effecting me, but it’s hard for me to hold back the passion I feel for her. We talked recently about sitting down one night and trying sexual things in the hopes that something in her body will be turned on, and she’s agreed to try. That resentment is something I’ve tried to subdue, and what you’re saying is exactly what’s plays through my head daily. Maybe this situation is not fulfilling me sexually, but it’s all about mutual interest for me. When I was in the worst point of my depression I could barely do the things required to keep me alive. People who are barely functioning can have good days fragile enough that making them do something they don't want to can completely end the goodness. For people with depression a good day might mean that you take a shower or get out of bed.
