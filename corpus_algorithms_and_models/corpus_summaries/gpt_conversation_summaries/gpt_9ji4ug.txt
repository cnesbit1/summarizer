Historical cases create very many difficulties for both the accused and the complainant. For the accused person, the historical gap almost inevitably leads to a loss of evidence which could exculpate them. For the complainant, inculpatory evidence likewise disappears, and memories also fade. There is always an uneasy tension between holding criminals accountable for horrid crimes on the one hand, and the need to ensure that no innocent person is wrongly convicted. While this is unfair to victims, at the same time, these limitations are meant to prevent potentially even greater unfairness - an innocent person being punished for a crime they did not commit. But, perhaps the most important point that I want to make is that this Senate hearing is one of the least effective ways to uncover the truth. There was no real examination or cross examination of witnesses. There should have been an FBI investigation, and then a brief put together, and all key witnesses should have been examined by two opposing counsel, at a minimum. This Senate hearing was more political theater than it was a search for truth - for either Ford or Kavanaugh. This entire procedure was doomed from the beginning. This bothers me, because so many victims and accused will see this hearing, and become disillusioned by this abhorrent process. From my perspective as a retired prosecutor, it's clear to me that neither side was particularly interested in the truth. This was political. Both political parties used the metoo movement politically, and damaged it.
