Do I think Senator Feinstein played it dirty by withholding the letter for six weeks? Yes.

Do I think it's questionable that six previous background checks by the FBI failed to turn up any hint whatsoever regarding sexual misconduct? Yes.

Does this outweigh the fact that Kavanaugh's history regarding mass surveillance/rendition is troubling? No.

Do I think a very dangerous precedent is being set regarding an allegation that has so little corroboration? Yes.

Does this outweigh the fact that I think it's very dangerous to have an unbalanced Supreme Court? No.

Do I think Kavanaugh was evasive during his most recent testimony in regards to his drinking? Yes.

Do I think Christine Ford's testimony had questionable aspects to it? Yes.

Do I think Roe vs Wade will ever be overturned? No.

Do I think the Patriot Act will ever be rescinded? No. Maybe re-branded but no significant change.

Do I think it's ironic that people on the left recently praising George W Bush are now using Kavanaugh's role in his administration against him? Yes.

Does that outweigh what Kavanaugh's views on those important issues seems to be? No.

I don't think I'll be heartbroken if Kavanaugh doesn't get confirmed.

I do think both he and Ford have been treated very badly. I'm guilty myself of going a little overboard.

I'm a conspiracy theorist...whatever that means these days. I have very little trust in our government and I think the invasion of our privacy and mass surveillance of the general public are reaching extremely dangerous levels.

Kavanaugh has a documented history regarding these topics.

Do I think Kavanaugh has led an outstanding life in public service overall and is extremely qualified in interpreting constitutional law? Yes.

Do I believe he committed the act he is accused of? No.

Doesn't matter...both testimonies are un-provable. He said - She said

No corroboration of her story. Once again, He said - She said.

All they can go on now is what Kavanaugh said during his testimony. Believe me, they're going after the drinking and perjury regarding it.

Passing out and blacking out are two different things. Blacking out isn't being unconscious, its being so drunk your brain cannot make new memories. Meaning you look and act normal (albeit drunk) but will never have a memory of what went on once you're at that level.
