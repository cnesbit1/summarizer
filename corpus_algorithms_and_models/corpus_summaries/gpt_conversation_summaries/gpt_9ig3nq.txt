If you're not "failing", then it's probably because you're not trying to push your envelope. I think this is a case of play stupid games win stupid prizes. This is just me personally but I think tricks are dumb, "look Ma, no hands" was fun when I was 9 but now I just want to ride. Also, if these dingus' are trying to "push their envelope" and learn new things then why don't they wear more protective gear? Hard to do dank whoolies after you smash your elbow into the asphalt. I pretty much expected him to fall, mostly because stunts are difficult. It's the unexpected part after that made it funny. They're not making fun of him per se but rather the situation. The funnier bit is the second guy falling too for no real reason than the sheer surprise his friend fell off the bike too. They're probably ok. Though personally I'd be wearing something like a Revit Bison overshirt to at least protect against (elbow) bumps. Schadenfreude is fun. Especially as it applies to the 2nd dude. And to be fair in either persons situation i would be laughing hysterically at myself. I have a couple (seemingly rational) issues with it: 1) If you're going to practice tricks, wear gear appropriate for the trick. I'm not here to sing the song of ATGATT, but if you're going to be practicing a move where you're standing on top of the bike, maybe more than a t-shirt is a good idea. 2) I can't tell if this is a public road or not. If it's not, I'm completely okay with practicing there. If it is, this is actually the poster child for not practicing on a public road. Unmanned motorcycle missions in traffic are really, really bad. Gotta find someplace with less chance of causing a bigger issue than a crash. We're making fun, because it's funny. Funny because the bike rides on without him. Yeah that's physics, but sometimes physics is funny. Funny because his riding partner crashes for no apparent reason. These two may not be cut out for the stunt rider circuit. And yeah, you only learn through failing. But if he's still learning, he should gear up for the inevitable oopsies.
