Occam's Razor tells me #2 makes more sense, but whenever anything scientific is brought up around my Christian friends, they all end up leading to #1, so I have learned to keep my mouth shut. This makes having a community of fellow Christians in my life very hard.

I don't want to disrespect anyone or alienate the few Christian friends I do have, but it doesn't make it easy to turn to Christianity when I can't talk openly about this, as the few times I have broached the subject, I get a shut-down, closed-minded response, or a link to some website that was written in the same style as whack-job UFO conspiracy sites.

One family I am friends with gave me a list of "non-negotiable truths" of what it means to be a Christian, part of that is believing in the Bible without question (Biblical inerrancy). Does that mean to have questions is not Christian? I have Mormon and Catholic friends who also wouldn't make the cut according to that list, so am I not allowed to call them Christians, and must I assume that they are hell-bound?

What should I believe? Is my soul just being held from heaven by Satan because I refuse to believe the science conspiracy? Is believing this conspiracy requisite for salvation? I thought it was about accepting Jesus Christ as my savior. I want to teach my children how to be a good Christian while also teaching them how the world works, which is the goal of science. I feel this shouldn't be mutually exclusive, but according to the only Christians I know in person, they are.
