I was very pro-abortion, Libertarian type do with your body what you will type myself, until my wife made the choice to carry through with pregnancy, at a time when neither of us were ready, or capable of supporting anyone else but ourselves. In my book it was a woman's choice, even though I disagreed, I supported her choice.

That child, 7 years later has absolutely changed my entire Outlook and perspective on life. I became much less selfish, and much less of a do whatever makes YOU happy kind of guy, to this is my little person, and now I have something to live for, nurture, and protect. It shook my world more then anything else ever has.

If you watched the video the Center for Medical Progress's undercover video of a Planned Parenthood abortion, where they are literally ripping the baby out of the mother, then dissecting it to preserve the baby's organs, and you're still pro-abortion, you have a disconnect with your ability to love life in general.

Nobody should be allowed to kill their own baby just because being a parent would be an inconvenience. It’s not a matter of what she does with her own body. It’s what she does to the body of her own baby. There’s right, there’s wrong. Abortion is wrong.

Women absolutely do have the rights to control what happens inside their bodies. It's called birth control, a condom, or a morning after pill. I'm even ok with a woman terminating a pregnancy in the first 30 days. But once that baby's heart starts beating, it's no longer just the woman's body, it's her babies body also.

Nobody forces you to get pregnant. This small statement debunks your last 3 responses. You keep repeating the same false comparisons.

If I was a woman and got raped and even thought for a second I might get pregnant, I'd immediately go and buy a morning after pill. Probably two of them. Again, I said I'm even ok with terminating a pregnancy within 30 days. There's no excuse except irresponsibility after that, period.

Freedom of choice is not the same as pro death. But keep spewing this nonsense about how righteous you would be if you were in that position.
