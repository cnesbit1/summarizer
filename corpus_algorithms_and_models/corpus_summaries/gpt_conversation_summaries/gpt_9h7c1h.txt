Can a person born and raised in a society that has a different religion say Hindu for instance, can these people arrive to their faith the same way a Christian does and can they have similar spiritual experiences that lead them to believe that their God is the one true god?

I don't know that God is so petty that people who earnestly seek a creator god and follow the dictates of their conscious would be entirely denied because they got His name wrong.

I don't think we necessarily need to say that another religion is true to say that there are people who are genuinely worshiping god within it...

It’s very possible to me that people born and raised believing in Muhammad or Vishnu genuinely believe their god to be true, and they arrived at that truth by using personal experiences, faith and being culturally raised with that faith...

My question is how can one actually prove that their god is real over another’s? Considering they came to believe in their truth the same way but were just raised in different societies/cultures.

Right on!  So no one can actually prove that their god is real. Other than quoting scripture, but who knows that the book of the Bible is actually truth, other than having faith that it is. So quoting scripture and using versus is not actual fact and unreliable. And the other way would be using personal experiences and faith.

Most of the answers I get are: because I have faith and my personal experiences reaffirm my belief.
