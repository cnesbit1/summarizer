My ex husband raped me on more than one occasion when I was asleep. I woke up to him sticking KY in me, then his penis.

I went to my Priest. He told me my marriage vows equaled my consent, and he chastised me for not giving my ex more sex.

I told that priest to go to hell and I divorced that man, but I never pressed charges. I was too afraid.

Instead he told people I cheated on him and he destroyed my relationship with my father. He told my father I was a whore, and my Dad believed him.

Thankfully, he lives many states away. Dr. Ford is courageous. I’m so glad she is telling. She speaks for me today. God bless her.

I’m overwhelmed by the support.

I can’t even tell you though how many people I’ve had to block. People telling me I’m a troll; that I made this up, etc. it’s exactly why I’ve stayed silent.

To the sickos that congratulated me on being raped or hoped it happens again to me - there are no words. I hope you don’t have women in your life if you throw around wishes of sexual assault. You are part of the problem!!!

My ex-husband also raped me. I never pressed charges. He gave me the same excuse the priest gave you - we were married so he was allowed to whenever he wanted. I’m so sorry this happened to you.

Jesus, that’s horrifying and I’m sorry for you.

I’m so sorry that happened to you.

Thank you for saying that.

Same here. He did it to me once, and I told him never to do it again. He did it the *very next morning*.

I informed him that he raped me. He exclaimed "You can't rape your wife!"

One of the most important things to me in my new marriage is how he absolutely listens to me and never makes me feel like I "have" to have sex.

My ex believed it. He was shocked I would use rape to describe sex he coerced me in to or did this very thing (sleep sex) when I told him not to before.

Like he acted fucking hurt I would call him a rapist (which I didn't outright do but I did say he clearly raped me so...) Like how horrible of me.

Its lack of empathy. He always wanted sex so he would be thrilled if the roles were reversed and therefore couldn't understand how I could possibly see it different

I remember a couple times I woke up to my
