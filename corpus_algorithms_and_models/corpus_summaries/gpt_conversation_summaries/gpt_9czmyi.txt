Radical Feminism in most all its forms is incompatible with Christianity. From the ones that claim marriage is a tool to oppress women to the ones that argue for men to be killed in mass to TERFs to SPRFs to SNRFs to the SCUM manifesto. None of the wide lattitude is compatible with Christianity.  
Really? I think Christianity is wildly supportive of radical feminism - granting equal rights to women is pretty radical, valuing a woman's word equal to a man's, appointing a woman to be leader and elder... pretty radical.  
Marriage is often a tool used to oppress women - look at how it is used throughout the world - you can not rationally argue marriage isn't used to oppress. Christians should oppose the use of marriage to oppress women and scripture demands we do.  
The best time to leave white Christendom in America was years ago.  
The second best time is now.  
There are many.  
But they donâ€™t preach white Christendom.  
White = the ethnicity.  
Christendom = before 313 CE, Christianity was a subversive religion. In 313 CE, Christianity married power, in the form of Constantine. In some way, shape, or form, Christianity has since struggled with being both a political power and a religion based on the teachings of Jesus who seems to care a lot more for the power*less* than the power*ful*.  
White Christendom, to me, symbolizes that faith, which I also held for quite some time, that wants the American flag up on the alter, supports US military power, and, like the article in the OP, sits atop systems of power instead of struggling to help those trapped by systems of power.  
As an attendee of a majority white (but, to be fair, reasonably diverse) church with white pastors, in the SBC, we don't have American flags up front, and the Fourth of July service isn't any different from any other week. There's still some good white, Christian, churches out there.
