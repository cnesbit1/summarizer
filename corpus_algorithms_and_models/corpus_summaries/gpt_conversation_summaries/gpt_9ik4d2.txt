I'd been dating a girl, we'll call her Cheyenne, for 4 years (together since we were seniors in high school). Cheyenne has some mental issues that she has dealt with since she was young. Anxiety, depression, and anger management problems. Whenever we got in fights, she would resort to screaming, verbal abuse, and, occasionally, physical violence. This past May, Cheyenne got extremely sick and got diagnosed with Celiacs disease. She stopped taking her meds due to being so sick and never got back on them. The Sunday she came home, she told me she had actually stayed in New York and stayed with a guy she was with before we got together. She finally moved out (quit her job to move in with the guy she cheated on me with in NY, while also attempting to break our lease). Cheyenne finally snapped and punched me, as hard as she could, in the neck, in front of everybody. After a lot of careful consideration, or at least I hope, I went to the police station and reported her. The officer I reported the incident to looked at me as if I was joking. I told him I was just trying to do the right thing. I am by NO MEANS a perfect person nor was I perfect boyfriend. I had done my fair share of hurtful things towards Cheyenne, as many couples do whether they intended to do so or not. I, however, am guilty of neglect.
