Over in /r/dogs the other day someone asked for help because they actually came on their dog and they couldn't catch him to give him a bath. 

I get on average one spam call per day from random numbers across the US (live in US). Seems perfectly reasonable. I usually answer with “is this a robot?” And then hang up when it is.

I get about one spam call per week, I never pick it up. I haven’t gotten one in over 3 weeks now. Maybe just don’t pick it up if you don’t recognize the number?

I get a handful on most days. It always numbers somewhat similar to my own.

Huh. I've never ever received spam call. But I'm in Europe, that might be it.

Yeah I just got one a few minutes ago.  I get 30 to 40 a month easy.

I get about 10 spam calls a day on average. Sometimes I fuck around with them but I wouldn't pretend to be kidnapped lmao

IDGAF who you are, if I don't have your number in my contacts, I'm probably not picking up the first time. Leave a voicemail or text me your number first. Spam call spoofing is rampant in the States these days.
