&gt;It’s hard to make an argument that Bernier’s 13-year-old connection to a think tank that was partly funded by a network of think tanks that is partly funded by the Koch brothers is relevant to the average Canadian.

&gt;The preamble to the interview on the CBC website gives a clue as to what Mesley was hinting at, though: “Bernier has linked his political beliefs to libertarianism, an ideology that forms the bedrock of many of the populist governments which have swept into power from the U.S. to Brazil." This is an odd sentence

This is the left wing media playbook these days. Find a group or organization that does not align with your worldview/ideology and connect them with a group everyone hates.

What was Trudeau's weed promise, if not populist and aimed at a young demographic?

Debatable. I'm all for legalizing it, but it was more of a populist play than it was 'good governance', which we can see in how it was given to the provinces to roll out (aka screw up).

The Fed can’t come in and force provs to run booze or weed

Populist isn't a synonym for popular. Weed legalization is the kind of thing that experts and evidence have been supporting as good policy for a long time.

Populism usually shows up when people are running for office, not once they're in office. It's the things they promise to secure votes. Pot was one in the last election, so was electoral reform. Only one of those actually ended up getting pushed through.

A state owned news agency that costs millions in taxpayer money to run that almost no one reads, is biased against a libertarian.
