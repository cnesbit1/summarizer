All jokes aside, you genuinely donâ€™t know me. Iâ€™m an anxiety-riddled flesh bag diagnosed with depression, so ego is not something I have right now. Iâ€™m trying to build confidence after four years of hating myself and thinking I donâ€™t deserve to be happy with who I am, but itâ€™s a tough process. Youâ€™ve seen literally one moment from me: a moment of frustration and disgust. Itâ€™s tough to judge an entire person from one moment.

Being depressed and hating yourself doesn't give you a free pass to be antagonistic to people for no real reason. What did you achieve from this interaction? You wouldn't have felt 'frustration and disgust' if you didn't engage with him. Maybe you wouldn't hate yourself if you tried to be a bit nicer to people.

I AM nice to people. I have moments like this, though, where Iâ€™m not. Moments. You genuinely donâ€™t know me.

Strangers take their moments out on me all the time. Iâ€™m sorry, but Iâ€™m not going to allow people to shit on me for something we all do.

What do you want from me, perfection? Hindsight is 20/20 and Iâ€™m not always going to be right. My reactions arenâ€™t always going to be perfect or my best. I will make mistakes and continue to. Iâ€™m not going to beat myself up because I was rude to one guy on Tinder who is an asshat anyway.

I thought I was a big olâ€™ butthole, but thank you for sharing your optimism! ðŸ’œ I bet youâ€™re equally lovely and kind.
