On the track the rear brake can be used at high lean angles to allow the rider to maintain throttle/weight transfer while keeping and/or slightly tightening the line with a gentle application. Alot of GP riders however do not use it, or some like petrucci use a thumb brake for the rear for a more precise feel. Riders like Kevin Schwantz won the 500GP world championship, and never touched the rear brake. Anyway, it's a preference. When you see the riders coming down from 200MPH on the straights into the first turn, scrubbing off 100-150MPH of speed with the back wheel inches in the air- they are not using the rear brake. Some racers choose to use it to alter their line. Most just decide that the benefits arenâ€™t worth the attention and precision required. There are no motogp bikes that have no rear brake. So everyone uses it. Some have bigger rear brake rotors because their riding style requires it. Others have a tiny rear brake rotor because they use it very little. The rear is used pretty much just as /u/nidyanazo said above, to adjust lines mid corner, to help control the back end while backing it in, and some use it to control front end lift while powering out of the corner. To add to what's already been said and to stay on rear brake and engineering, some riders have a thumb lever on right side of the handlebars to have a better control on right turn.
