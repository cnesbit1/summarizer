as much as iâ€™d like to agree, i think having him back would mess things up  
I dunno, he'd be humbled for sure.  After MacKinnon's season last year, it's not like he can come in and expect the same role he had (which is what I think I heard Colorado fans saying was holding mackinnon back?).  
at this point I wouldn't take him on my team, I'm taking no risks this is some voodoo shit  
Plus the Avs wont need another center with Jack Hughes being gifted to them next year  
Well considering we got fucked 2 years ago last place doesnt mean much  
Imagine him between Nik and Pat.... mmmmm
