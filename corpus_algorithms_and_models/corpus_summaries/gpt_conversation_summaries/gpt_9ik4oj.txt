No. Women are not unequal from men. They have different roles.  
I'm not saying women are worse pastors/priests. I am saying that isn't what their role is in the Church. I am convinced based on evidence in the new testament.  
Women can be as smart if not smarter than men. But the bible says in multiple places that women are to be silent in church and provide things other than leadership  
Not "for some reason", but because what the Bible says. And if they accept it, they wouldn't want to become leaders to start with. You're still misrepresenting the OP.  
If you are questioning the validity of scripture, this is not the post to argue it.  
&gt;that women are to be silent in church  
To be fair that Epistle was aimed at a certain church in the Church. We don't know the specifics of that church but perhaps the women were rowdy or gossiping.
