This is low hanging fruit...if you can make your partner feel *good* in a relatively harmless way, you should do it. Exaggerate it, even...  
There needs to be a line drawn between being honest and providing too much info.  
Honestly, you should probably just dump the poor guy so he can go find someone who'll appreciate him.  
I understand that it can be a little annoying since you have to pretend that it’s actually big, when you know it’s not, so I don’t blame you for asking for advice since you seem to want it to stop.  
I wouldn’t subscribe to this way of building relationships based on obvious lies hehe. He should be able to handle criticism.  
Why criticize something that might destroy someone’s confidence?  
If a relationship is ruined by simple truth of someone's penis being average size it shouldn't have existed in the first place.  
Apparently people are "jerks" now because they don't lie in order to sustain people's inflated ego.  
Would you like to be called /average/ by your partner?  
If one person loves the other, there should be no need to say anything in the first place.  
Surprise surprise that the average penis is ... average; that's a statistical fact so a lot of people are going to have an average or below average penis.
