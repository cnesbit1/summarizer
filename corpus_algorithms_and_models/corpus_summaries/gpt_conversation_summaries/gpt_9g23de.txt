Murderers are not victims. Mental health is a serious issue in Canada, if every murderer claims mental health issues and it is accepted. it brings down everyone else with real mental health issues. 

The Ontario shooter was presented as not criminally responsible by the press. Same with that fucker who killed the 14 year old girl. The criminals themselves may not plead not criminally responsible but the coverage of their crimes suggests it. 

I said that in the way that the information is provided it makes the public believe that these individuals have a form of mental illness, or are not criminally responsible. 

Yes, if they're white it's mental illness. If they're brown it's terrorism. If they're black it's gang violence. News is garbage. Turn it off. 

The gunman is also dead. Faisal Hussain, a 29-year-old Toronto resident suffered from severe mental health issues, 

They could have just stated that _____ ____ a __ year old Toronto resident shot and killed 2 people and injured 14 other. But they had to **imply**, which is what i was talking about, that it wasn't his fault and that he suffered mental issues.
