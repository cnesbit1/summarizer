Care to explain? Those are typical munition calibres that both the SAF and SPF use.  
Depends on what kind of 7.62. 7.62x39(AKM/SKS) means possible terrorism. 9mm and .45acp are pistol calibers. Pistols are easier to conceal, and therefore easier to smuggle. It's unlikely it's from a patrolling officer since we use .38.  
203mm is probably artillery shell.  
while 203mm is an artillery shell, the Singapore Artillery doesn't have a weapon system that fires 203mm shells. At most 155m. Now if it was a 227mm rocket...then yes, that's our HIMARS.  
Our snipers and gpmg uses the nato 7.62x51 while the 7.62 x 39 are mostly used by AKs and AKM.  
It's understandable, most people are confused by it
