It’s no excuse, but large bodied people are discriminated against far far more than thin people. 

If you are extremely obese it does indicate some lack of self-discipline, which is where the judgement comes from. 

What tools would you suggest - swaths of research are showing that dieting actually causes weight gain in the long run. 

Like drugs and alcohol, this is a multifaceted issue that involves socioeconomic barriers where our current “tools” fail. 

What I will say is that I notice there is a correlation between obesity and level of education. 

Stupid fad crash diets that people follow for 2 weeks and then abandon will fail every time, because people go right back to the bad habits that got them that size in the first place. 

100lbs after 12 years seems pretty successful to me. 

I am aware that it does not work to fat shame, or they'd all be eating portions comparable to my own. 

Calories in calories out works without fail. 

If you wanna get philosophical, sure we are. 

Working diets don't cause weight gain long term. 

Dieting is really simple, but not easy.
