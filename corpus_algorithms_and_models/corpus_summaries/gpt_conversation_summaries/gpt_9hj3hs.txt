Better than waiting until after free agency deadline and signing with another team before you let your team know  
As long as he plays to win and gives it everything he's got every night, I don't think his teammates mind a whole lot. It's when players stop trying and caring that teammates have a problem with it.  
For real. At least the GM gets plenty of time to move him instead of him walking for nothing.  
It's still a unionized environment. Players are expected to get paid as much as possible and exercise their rights as a UFA.  
People who get offended by full disclosure in a situation where you should do what’s best for yourself aren’t worth being friends with.  
Yeah, they all know it's business.  
The difference is, the Leafs now have good management and a great team. The Isles just had their best player walk for free because he didn't see any future for the team - but he saw one in Toronto.  
dude calm down. take it easy and lay off the salt. i know, it may end you since its what powers you but seriously JT is gone, if they tried to sign him for two years and he didnt sign then maybe they should have traded him? Blame management not the player, blame the isles shit asset management.  
its prob his one chance to go to UFA, i bet all the players understand this too. Panarin is a nice kid.  
Dont want where you have a Stastny 2014, or Tavares last season where you lose him for nothing.  
Yeah, it’s going to be a elephant in the locker room situation, but at least they won’t side step the question and say yeah I’m committed but in the end he leaves the team.
