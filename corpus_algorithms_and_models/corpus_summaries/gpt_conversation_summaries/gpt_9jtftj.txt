Kav has supported so many Bush era spying and detaining policies throughout his career. The American people know nothing about his actual judicial opinions or theories, it's been drowned out. He's a Bush Era, Jesuit taught, Anti-Constitutionalist, who was a member of a sex-cult fraternity catering to the 1%... A real r/conspiracy nightmare

They did the usual smoke and mirrors to distract and pass a shadow government stooge. It's hilarious to me that people like Alex Jones are still under the allusion that trump is a "populist", or against the deep state.

Hes surrounded himself with neocons and bankers, deregulated the big banks, pushed for war with Iran, etc. Basically shilled for the deep state.

Alex Jones has lost his fucking mind, dude. Just the other day infowars was calling for actual martial law. The irony is thick, but itâ€™s always been a mistake to trust him. Even Bill Cooper warned against believing Alex Jones.

AJ is the conspiracy version of a televangelist. He will say or do anything that keeps the money flowing in.

Trump is so deep state, they would need a proctologist if he wanted out.

He went to a catholic school growing up, the sect of catholicism was Jesuit.

Even the late great Bill Cooper called him an alarmist and liar.

Stupid, weak people listen to the guy - but he's actually pretty smart - got paid!
