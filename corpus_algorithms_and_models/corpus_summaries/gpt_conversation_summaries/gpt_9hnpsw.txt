I told him to call the RCMP scam hotline about this. He did and then he felt better. I hope that more people report this when it happens. We can overwhelm the RCMP with complaints until they complain to the government to get on this.

Look at the letters as they will always indicate an account number, sometimes fully visible or in the case of a SIN, it would be partially masked, unless a legal document like a garnishment.

If you call the CRA collectors as opposed to General Enquiries, you will get a better, more confident response.

As an accountant I can tell you emphatically that CRA will not tell you ANYTHING unless you are authorized on the taxpayer’s account. They won’t even tell you if they sent or received mail. However, they deal exclusively in mail (never email though). They will not initiate anything with a phone call.

If the taxpayer calls in and confirms identity then CRA will discuss the account. If the taxpayer isn’t capable, they can sign a T1013 for a family member to be authorized on their behalf.

Considering the CRA never calls you and pretty much only sends you letters, I would think you are correct.

An older truck driver was at a gas station I went to trying to return $1000 in gift cards he bought to send them. He was told it was a scam before he sent them thankfully but was still out the $1000 as they were non refundable.

The number to call the RCMP anti-fraud line is: 1-888-495-8501.
