An animal isn't worth risking your life over.  
Its a tougher decision on a bike as even a medium size dog would be enough to take the bike out.  
He shed 98% of his forward speed braking as he did, then hit the ground.  
The basic instinct should always be to take as much speed off as possible by doing a controlled emergency stop.  
To be perfectly honest a dog being walked off leash isn't worth enough to their owner for me to feel bad if I hit it.  
If you don't leash your dog, you clearly just see them as property or whatever to the point that you don't care if they run off and never come back.  
Hitting a dog on a motorcycle = crashing.  
You could also potentially bend your forks hitting a 50 lb dog at the right speed.  
I think the slight fairing damage and a non-dead dog is the best outcome, considering he could have bent his forks and killed the dog and possibly lost control at a higher speed.  
A motorcycle is narrow and change direction quickly, when I do an emergency braking, I also try to dodge the obstacle.
