hi guys! i’ve been starting to exercise recently to work on my tummy fats especially, so i’ve been mainly doing abs workouts routines and also thighs. but is it normal for me not to feel the post workout burn in my stomach area? and any tips for tummy fat loss? i’m not sure if this targeted exercises will help. i’ve been also tryna eat healthier!

If you do them frequently, sooner or later you’ll feel less burn, but that’s a sign you should be increasing your training intensity.

If your goal is to see your abs, eating right and doing weight training followed by high intensity interval training are more important than abs exercises. Check out Jeremy Ethier on youtube.

you cant spot reduce fat. to get rid of fat you need overall fat loss aka more cardio/hiit. best way to see results is do 30 min cardio/hiit twice a week in addition to your current workout routines.

There's no such thing as targeted exercise. You will lose tummy fat once your overall fat % is lowered.

Careful not to work on your abs too much at once (esp. with oblique exercises) as that can lead to an increase in waist circumference (I personally experienced this).

like what they're saying, targeted exercises work only for developing muscle but not for burning fat.

to lose fat all around, you just need to eat less calories and/or engage in physical activities. activities like running or swimming help because they increase your daily calorie needs. the kind of food you eat is not too important but healthier choices generally contain lower calories so they're easier to manage than fried and junk food. they also reduce the risks of heart diseases, diabetes, and other illnesses because they contain less oil, sugar, and addictives.

all in all, do things in moderation and don't rush through weight loss.
