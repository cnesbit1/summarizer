So you all know about the Sunspot Observatory right? Well the FBI shut it down with no explanation about 2 weeks ago, and just recently they said it was because someone had child pornography so it had to be closed to catch/investigate them. 

This makes no sense because they completely evacuated the houses and facilities nearby, which is not something that would happen if it was just the child pornography.

Further there were black hawk helicopters circling the site, suggesting there was a more important event occurring.

My theory is that they may have tracked a solar flare or asteroid heading for earth, and are hiding it to prevent panic.

We're also in a solar minimum right now so solar flares and sun activity in general is low, relatively speaking.

Other countries have observatories after all and there are other not closed US observatories and satellites constantly observing the sun.

I dont think its aliens or solar flares, but I'm also positive the story they're feeding us is BS.

They evacuated and closed the place because the person caught with child porn threatened to kill his coworkers.

The person who still hasn't been arrested?  Nobody has been arrested, to my knowledge, in this entire ordeal.

Why close the post office? Did he threaten them too?
