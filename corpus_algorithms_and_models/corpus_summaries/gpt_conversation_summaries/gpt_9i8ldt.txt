All these shit posts are getting a large amount of upvotes. 

My reason for saying this is I believe the same people who banned r/Q, r/Anon, etc. are trying to AstroTurf this sub into looking like an alt-right hub for the people who were kicked out of the banned subs. 

I know people have said that this sub has gone downhill for awhile now in terms of conspiracy content (too much politics, repeated theories, etc.) I'm not talking about that. 

Mention anything Q here and it triggers the Q haters. 

Q is an alleged military insider with "Q" level clearence (supposedly one of the highest) that begun dropping "crumbs" back in 2016/2017 pointing to a corrupt deep state embedded within the governments of the world. 

Since then, his posts have essentially confirmed they work with/for POTUS and military intelligence and they are the communication hub as a direct line to the awakening public as deep state corruption is exposed. 

I never understood the hate toward Q just as I never understood the hate toward pizzagate, both had their points, counter-points, followers, dissenters, etc. 

But, here we are. This sub canâ€™t mention Q or pizzagate now because of r/TheBanOut2018 and fear that the entire community will be scrubbed from the internet. 

The narrative is set, rules and boundaries have been created. 

The proper course of action is never to censor someone, and if you find yourself in that position then you may be on the wrong side of history. 

It is **entirely possible** that Q and pizzagate are both true AND false. 

*The problem here is that we've been robbed of even discussing it and the bulk of evidence has been deleted from the internet*. 

However, does that mean that a topic of conversation should be removed entirely? 

If evidence starts to accumulate, but it seems to have some political affiliations, are we to simply turn our heads and forget what we know? 

We are not gatekeepers. 

If the argument falls apart under scrutiny then it was a weak argument, but if it holds together *and is then censored from the internet* what are we to believe? 

There's a difference between hate and censorship, though. 

Pizzagate was the closest we have come to uncovering a massive and very powerful pedophilia network that also had a giant online audience digging into its details and widespread MSM coverage. 

Yes, exactly!
