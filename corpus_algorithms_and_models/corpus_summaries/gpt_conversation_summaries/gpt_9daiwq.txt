He’s the only one with balls to stand up against Trump’s rule breaking bullshit. What most didn't expect was that despite that well known fact, he is still fighting back. Canada has a choice to take a bad deal and take a minor hit, or not take the deal and take a major hit. Trudeau hasn’t fought with anything more practical then words. Infact he explained the approach "Canadians are polite; we’re reasonable, but we also will not be pushed around,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, taking a firm stance at the end of the G7 summit. A negotiation requires concessions, why sell out the country by virtue signalling for the 1-2% of Canada who supports Trump against their own interests? I pointed out a vulnerability in the American negotiating position, every vulnerability can absolutely be leveraged, that's negotiation 101 my friend. If we don't, this economy will be hit into an instant recession, especially from Auto Tariffs. US would be saving themselves, not Canada. What Trump (and the Daddy Defence Force) fail to realize is that the North American auto industry is incredibly interconnected, tearing up NAFTA or imposing auto tariffs would DESTROY the rust belt, many of these states are still recovering from the recession and lack industry diversification. Yet heres the US with a booming economy, domestically productive citizens and they currently have Canada cornered in negotiating the Free trade agreements.
