Canada Post provide pretty decent service. 

I think they should make a living wage but not too much more. 

Puralator and ups drivers make more for example. 

When you factor in benefits and pensions I would bet that UPS and Purolator drivers make less. 

Canada post pays wages out of profits and they have been consistently profitable for a while now. 

Itâ€™s unskilled but it is hard, and a very high percentage of people quit early. 

I will clarify: Canada Post should not make more than the average wage for unskilled labour. 

Canada post made about 75M before tax in 2017. 

The fact remains unchanged: Canada Post labour is unskilled, could be completely by most able bodied people, and should be paid as such. 

UPS, Fedex, and Purolator are all private companies. 

Canada Post is a public company which until very recently consumed large amounts of tax dollars and is teetering on the verge of going back to its old consuming ways. 

A similar UPS or Fedex employee makes about $5-10K less with their pensions depending on their plans are not defined benefit.
