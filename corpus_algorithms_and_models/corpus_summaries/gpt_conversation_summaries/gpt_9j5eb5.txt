The accuser has taken a polygraph, which detected no deception, and folks on the right still refuse to believe her. 

Why aren't they calling for Kavanaugh to pass a polygraph? 

Oh, right... because privileged white men are rarely held accountable for their actions. Especially actions involving abusing women.

Can I just point out that part of your basis for your belief appears to be based on a prejudice towards his race gender and socioeconomic status and that this sub didn’t always stand for that?

“Didn’t always..” is the main point here. Eventually everything turns into an echo chamber full of hate for everything.

It's the subreddit life cycle. Be great, attract too much attention, quickly become popular with people who don't get it, the spirit dies.

If anyone interested, the polygraph report has been released....

2 questions were asked:

1. Is any part of your statement false. 

2. Did you make up any part of your statement.

The thing is, the results don't matter. Well they do, the results matter that she was found to be not lying on the polygraph. The validity of the test doesn't matter. The headline "accuser voluntarily takes polygraph and passes" matters because its clickbait and is easily used to push a narrative. 

It never should have been relevant, polygraphs are useless.

@jmtyndall - you hit the nail on the head. What you're referring to is officially known in the profession of psychology as "implicit bias" and every human has it.
