When I was young, The Maid(singaporean horror movie)  
Definitely ju-on  
OG Shutter.  
I felt Conjuring was not too bad; the *clap clap* cupboard scene made me jump  
The Ring back when I was in primary school  
Conjuring 2 is probably subjectively scarier, but I'm so desensitized to horror already that it was just a good ride when I watched it  
Heredity  
That was my first horror movie as well! watched it during a chalet in sec sch. Images of the ghost lingered in my head for monthsüòÇ  
Just dyed my hair pink and cut bangs and now the consensus is that i look like an anime character :‚Äù)  
Congrats, you are now an anime protagonist :)
