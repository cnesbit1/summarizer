Her testimony was televised live for the whole world to watch.  
When Ford saw that he was a potential nominee, she brought it up to her representative, who told the president’s office.  
If you watched the hearing you'd know that Feinstein respected Dr. Ford's wish for privacy, confident her office didn't leak the info.  
Let’s face it, Trump is a stubborn guy. Once he picked Kavanaugh, there was no way in hell he’d back off that decision.  
There’s no way he’ll withdraw that nomination, he’ll let the whole thing play out.  
Something like sexual assault shouldn’t be used as “hitting back”. Ford should have been given her privacy for this.  
That's why there should have been an investigation rather than trying to hamfist his confirmation.  
I’m glad that there is an investigation happening now.  
My question is how was the LETTER leaked.  
I feel bad for both parties I feel like both probably believe what they are saying.
