Unfortunately, it just isn't possible to get the kind of evidence you are looking for. We will likely never know for certain if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent of any or all of these accusations. I agree he is due a presumption of innocence.

That said, he isn't due a presumption of *fitness* for office. His erratic testimony, his checkered past, the broiling scandal surrounding him all seem to be enough in the eyes of many people, *Catholic Magazine* in particular, to disqualify him. There are better people out there. Let's nominate someone more even-tempered and less problematic.

The allegations hold no water enough that when the FBI won’t investigate. What this is is delaying the vote in order for democrats to hopefully regain the senate, impeach Trump then hold up any SC justice picks until they can get a Democrat in there. This is a last minute hurrah. The allegations are fake news. All it is is delaying the vote so they can hopefully win the senate back and delay it further so they can get their guy in that seat. That’s all this is. A last ditch effort to win. They’re are just harping on the strings of people’s emotions with lies.

However, the Judge book is also troubling. Now, there's this Swetnick accusation to contend with. Not to mention Kavanaugh's erratic testimony yesterday. It's more a combination of these factors than a single accusation that have caused people to reconsider.

Republicans should have done a better job vetting their candidate, that's for sure. There are other people, better people to nominate than this guy.

The event is as real as a David Copperfield event.

All this is and you agree but you’re not entirely convinced for some reason is delaying the vote. That’s the only thing at stake here. Don’t let him get in at all costs. That’s the game. The allegations are simply hearsay or potential lies of something that may or may not have happened 36 years ago. There’s zero proof of anything. I don’t care about the acts of a man that feels he’s wrongly accused of sexual assault. Books come out all the time and people profit from those books. Opinions aren’t evidence. And neither are allegations. Ford has already made a quarter of a million dollars from a go fund me fundraiser.

Just put it in contrast to Bill Cosby. Bill eventually admitted to drugging women. But that wasn’t until after over 20 women came forward. That holds weight.
