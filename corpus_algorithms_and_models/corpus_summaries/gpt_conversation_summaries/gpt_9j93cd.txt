Wipe what you can up with a towel or tissue, then just let the wet spot dry and sleep in it  
Get a mattress protector. You can out it over the sheets. You can buy the same size of your mattress. They are waterproof, and wasable. Look for them on Amazon  
Other than laying a towel down beforehand I donâ€™t see what else could be done. Tell her to clench really hard, or to cup herself right when you pull out.  
Cupping is always an option, they even do it in porn  
Expecting it to work well is silly. Also wouldn't really want it on my hand, any more than he wants it on his sheets
