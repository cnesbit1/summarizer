When I married my wife she was mess. She’s had a lot of really good help to get where she is now. Along the way I discovered she’s a masochist. Right after that I put wrist cuffs on her and, as we call it, I put her on the rope. I tied the cuffs up over her head. That’s been her signature thing ever since. My wife’s sexual response while tied that way was incredible. He suggested it relieves her of responsibility, so she can enjoy herself without feeling guilt. Bondage is often pointed out as a means for people to temporarily escape guilt and even just excessive social pressures. I know several people who feel just this way. If they are helpless and forced to feel pleasure it isn't their "fault". The sensations are 10 times stronger when they can't try to reciprocate to earn the pleasure or when they are allowed to fight back as hard as they want and are made to feel pleasure anyway. My wife pulls really hard on her restraints. I buy expensive padded leather wide wrist cuffs for her because she hammers down so hard on them that cheaper ones abraded her skin too much. I bought a nice brass bed once. I knew it would have to be sturdy. Had it made in New York City. Shipped out to our place. Thing weighs hundreds of pounds. We put it together and first night my wife hit the rope that bed sung like a musical instrument. Unbelievable how loud it was. My wife is petite, but she’s really strong. And she pulls against the rope like crazy.
