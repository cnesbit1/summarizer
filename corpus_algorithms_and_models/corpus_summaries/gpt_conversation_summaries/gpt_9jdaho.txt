Couldn't be easy to walk out on your junior team either. Those kids have aspirations of making the NHL and just want to play hockey.  
Clippers players didn't do anything because NBA stepped in immediately.  
A cheap owner and incompetent GM isn't remotely close to the owner of a team with predominately black players saying "don't bring that nigger to my games" on tape.  
The team did that because the coaching staff was fired after a win against one of the best teams in the league.  
Clippers talked about boycotting games and got assurance from the NBA that it would be resolved.  
Melnyk is damaging the league's image. If the players or fans did something to draw a lot of attention, it would start the wheels turning.  
The players aren't going to do anything and fans are still going to go to games. They're also going to want drinks and food while watching those games.  
If they aren't going to do anything about Arizona drawing 12000 on average and being a perennial cap floor team (who's dead contracts do they have this year to reach it?) they aren't going to do anything about Ottawa.  
This time, they took on Marian Hossaâ€™s contract.  
I think the math has it they're above the cap floor even without the LTIR contracts.  
LTIR contracts don't help a team hit the cap floor except for during the off-season. That's the whole point of LTIR.  
The reason Arizona takes on those deals is to give relief to their trade partner. Chicago is up against the cap in the off-season and Arizona isn't so they'll take on Chicago's burden in exchange for some minor incentive or concession.
