The Bible has been found to be in error on many facts that can be checked. The verses on homosexuality may be more errors. We know now that homosexuality is a biochemical matter that the person has no control over. We also know it is well represented in the animal kingdom and harms no one.

The Bible is infinitely interpretable. You can interpret the Bible for yourself as well as anyone. You interpret the Bible every time you chose someone else's interpretation and declare it correct.

This is a tough problem that about 10% of Christians (some becoming ex-Christians) have to deal with at some time so you aren't alone.

It is unsettling to recommend that a person make their own decisions on their own interpretations i.e., exercise their own free will. It offers a lot of scary autonomy. How can you guarantee they will believe the right way? That doesn't sound like something wolves, shepherds or sheep usually do does it.

I really hate to see people being harmed needlessly by religions, philosophies, cultures and group think. I know it is an egregious character flaw.

The OP of this thread is clearly religious and is looking for a religious answer. This top level comment while resembling what could be a religious answer, leans far enough away from it that the answer itself is questionable. So no, his refusal to respond to the top level commenter doesn't say anything about the person you're responding to, other than he doesn't waste time on answers that don't meet the initial criteria.
