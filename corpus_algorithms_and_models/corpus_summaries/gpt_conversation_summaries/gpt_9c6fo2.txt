You aren't a pedophile if you don't abuse children

Just gonna step in to clarify that this is incorrect. Pedophiles are people who are sexually attracted to children (you can get into specific terms depending on the age range, but for the purpose of keeping this simple the general term will just be ''pedophile'').

Being a pedophile in most countries isn't illegal, but **acting on these urges with a child is what turns you from a pedophile to a child abuser.**

TL:DR: You can be a pedophile and not be a child abuser, being a pedophile DOES NOT mean you are automatically a child abuser.
