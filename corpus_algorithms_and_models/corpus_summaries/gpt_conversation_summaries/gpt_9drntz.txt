100% no, unless she specifically asks about it.  
Because it comes across as extremely insecure and thats not particularly sexy to most women.  
Why is there nothing to be confident about? Dont make the 'issue' bigger than it is. It honestly isnt a big deal or dealbreaker most of the Times.  
Size doesn't matter as much as you think it does. It's only an issue if you make it one, or if your partner is a terribly selfish person.  
As a woman if a guy told me his dick size before we were literally in the process of hooking up, he would drastically reduce his chances of that ever happening. It’s too soon and inappropriate to tell me any other time, and if we’re about to have sex then I’ll find out soon anyway, so why bother?  
Plus, a lot of people are a lot more easily influenced than they would think. She might not consider it on the smaller side until you out it in her head.  
You don't want to upset the mood or momentum of the moment with an unnecessary disclaimer like that.
