He records and uploads all his classes.  
An activist student, who had been gunning for him to be fired for his position on First Nations, for no reason relevant to the discussion spoke in front of a room full of people about her having an Aziz Ansari type of "rape" during one of his classes.  
If this woman did not approve of the recording, then I have no sympathy for his firing.  
If you personally, as a rape survivor, want to have your story forever recorded online for any person to hear it and also have it associated with your name, that is fine. You make that choice for yourself. Not her.  
Should she perhaps not have told her story to a group of people and expected privacy? Sure. But his employer asked him to take it down, which seems like something easy to comply with, and instead he maliciously complied. Then the university fired him. I am fine with all of this. He did not commit a crime.  
Her story was bullshit and the only reason she vocalized it in his class was because she knew his classes were uploaded publicly and after a year of unsuccessfully trying to get him fired it worked.  
She purposely shared it publicly because she knew it was going to be uploaded as had every single other class of his she had ever attended.  
If the professor does indeed record and upload all of their classes, that is very different than the information we're given here.  
Recording and uploading all of your classes? Well standard practice that his students know about and were informed about before hand. If there's something you don't want recorded, don't talk about it. Pretty simple.  
Him secretly recording just this girl talking about her experience with sexual assault, and uploading it, when that's not standard class practice, is extremely shitty, and a fireable offence.  
Read the actual letter and not the vice article. He was posting all his lectures online. He didn't just secretly record the woman speaking and post it online. There are definitely some privacy concerns, but Vice is spinning the narrative.  
While I agree with you that the woman's actions were probably propelled by political motivation, this man took a principled stance that all things should be shared online. I fundamentally disagree with that, and think that it would have been very easy for him to cut her story out of his recording. Snip snip and the story is gone.  
If you want your side to appear more rational than the otherside, sometimes you need to eat crow and back down on principled stances in
