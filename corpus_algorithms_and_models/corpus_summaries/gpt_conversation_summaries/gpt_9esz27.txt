Jalen Ramsey, NFL player for the Jacksonville Jaguars, said that he could make the NHL in six months of training despite not even knowing how to skate.  
Ramsey said he could make the NHL with six months of practice.  
He didn't mean it as in it's easy to play in the NHL though, he meant it as he's so ridiculously athletic he could make the switch to pro hockey.  
Current NHL free agent @jalenramsey is confident he can crack a lineup in six months.  
Some of the boys shared their thoughts.  
I think the other way around is much more believable NHL -> NFL. Skating is not something you're automatically good at because you are athletic.  
Thats what Evander Kane said, said something like "I'd be 1000x better in his position in 6 months than he'd be in mine"  
There are guys in the NFL that never even touched a football until highschool. It might literally be impossible to make the NHL if you started skating that late.  
Pretty much every NHL level hockey player started playing before they turned 5, because you pretty much have to start that early to be able to skate that well.  
Even if it was intended as an insult, it's so completely and obviously not true (that Ramsey could make the NHL), that getting offended by it is completely ridiculous.  
I think it is theoretically possible to make the NHL if you started skating as an adult but I don't think anyone has the resources to make it happen.
