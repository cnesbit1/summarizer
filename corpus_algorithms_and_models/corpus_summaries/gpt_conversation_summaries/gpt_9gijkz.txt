For more acceleration, use either a smaller sprocket at front or bigger sprocket at back - or maybe both if you're replacing both sprockets and chain at one. To get more acceleration, you want a higher ratio, so adding teeth on the back or removing from the front would do that. Holy moly that's a massive jump, it'd probably half your top speed!! To be honest, it's generally best to go max 1 down at front and up 2 or 3 at rear. Also, a smaller front sprocket increases chain wear as it's stretched more in a tighter arc so more than 1 down would be bad for the chain and teeth. You don't wanna be having your top speed as the speed you're gonna cruise at as that'd be bad for your engine and chain sitting at that much stress constantly. If you must do this at all, try a 13 tooth on the front only which will give you a seven percent increase in revs across the speed range. Whilst cruising I like to sit just under where the bike is at it's max torque, so then the engine isn't overstressed nor lugging. I'd say the swap isn't worth doing unless your chain is toast. Just do 1 front tooth down. I did that on my 750 and loved it in the city. Changed it because I do more highway riding and lost 10mpg. Just 1 front down. And then use Waze to figure out what your speedometer reads at to know how fast you're going.
