The Bible was like a riddle in the past, but should be clear as day now that we have the New Testament to clarify Jesus Christ the Messiah, and who He is.  
Jesus walks in the garden in Genesis 3:8  
Jesus was one of the 3 men who came to Abraham in Genesis 18  
Jesus was the 4th man in the fire  
Jesus wrestled with Jacob  
Jesus was the Angel who spoke from the burning bush  
Jesus was ALWAYS the plan!  
Not trying to cause trouble but there is a lot of evidence that shows that most of the OT is made up by writers under King Josiah to unite northern and southern Israel.  
To accept that we have any warped version of the Bible would be to say that God would let the enemy, or corrupt man, warp His message.  
The Bible has a lot of reliable science (life in the blood, circle of the earth, relative time) in it between 66 books with over 40 authors.  
Not necessarily, but the archeological evidence supports the opposite of nearly all OT stories.  
Your first assertion is false. Archeology corroborates much OT history, particularly after David.  
Finkelstein represents an extreme view.  
Of course there are. But we have to listen to both sides and see what the evidence points to.  
I still think it’s pretty radical that 40 plus people who never met, wrote their own books that aligned into one integrated message.  
The message of God sending a savior to help bridge the gap for humanity and God is throughout and agreed upon.  
But it says as clear as day that God will send someone to crush the serpent, a King from the line of David.....to rule forever.  
Where did their understanding of modern science discoveries come from? Guesses?  
We are in a Holographic universe of space-time.  
The Bible said time is relative.  
“To the Lord a day is like 1,000 years and 1,000 years a day”  
It seems to illustrate that outside of earth, time is relative. Seems clear to me.  
We could go in circles all night about this I guess. Agree to disagree. Glad to know you at least have done your own research.
