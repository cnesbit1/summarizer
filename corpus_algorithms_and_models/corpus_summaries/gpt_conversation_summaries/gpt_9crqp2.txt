However, this kind of 'Malayan' sentiment is not new. LKY accepted that our separation is not cast in stone. Former foreign minister George Yeo considers himself a Malayan. People need to realise identity is fluid and constructed. Just as a person can claim to be both Singaporean and Christian, they can also be Singaporean and Malayan. Rabid nationalism is a disease that needs to be addressed. No, my point is that identity is not exclusive. Doesn't matter whether it's religion or nationality.
