I downvote not because I’m offended by it, but because it’s the same tired, low-hanging fruit that evangelicals jab at without any critical thought and actual interaction, as usual from the Bee.  
It's also a sign of being a jerk. Assuming backlash means you're right leads down a very bad feedback loop.  
Can you take criticism without lashing out and misrepresenting your interlocutor? Might actually lead to some profitable debates.  
Hitting a nerve isn't indicative of good satire.  
If someone posted an article saying "Local Jew upset he can't pay with pennies online", you'll get a ton of criticism and ire, but this is just a slur and an attack, not "good satire, bro".  
Of course it is indicative of good satire, but not in isolation. The example you cite is irrelevant since that's not what's happening in the original piece at all.  
What was the Crucifixion then? man started a riot in the temple. quite a negative feedback loop.  
I *always* downvote the Bee, because it's so lazy. Even when I find it funny that day.  
Insulting someone and then using their offense to measure how good your satire is, means it's really crappy satire.
