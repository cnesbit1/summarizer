But my wife thinks sex is dirty and wishes that it didn’t exist. We do have sex, maybe once every three months. I love my wife and my family very much and don’t want to do anything deceitful or hurt her in any way, but I don’t know how much longer I can take this. I don’t feel like I am being myself, because I have to almost hide my fantasies and desires. I have tried talking to her about this in the past, but her response is that she enjoys it when we do it but that usually she doesn’t want to do it. She refuses to consider adding sex toys or wearing sexy lingerie. It wouldn’t even be so bad if she wasn’t so hot! She says I should just masturbate when I need to, and that’s fine for temporary release of frustration but I still feel very empty without the intimacy, sensuality and eroticism in my life. I’m certain I’m not the only guy out there with this problem. I’m curious to hear any advice. Thanks. I will try talking with her, but I think there is an attitude toward sex that may not change. If my wife wished sex didn't exist, I would wish my marriage didn't exist, and truly make it so. You'll get resentful, which will effect your family life. IMO, if she isn't even willing to admit that it's a problem for you and won't talk about it, that shows a complete lack of respect for you by her. There's a big difference between being unable to have sex and being unwilling to have sex because you think it's dirty. You haven't read. She's repeatedly shut down attempts to discuss the issue, resists counseling. This has been raised multiple times over years. She refused to attempt to empathize with OP. Sex isn't important to her. That's fine. But it's important to him. But she doesn't care. So to be married to her, he has to give up sex entirely. Considering how important it is to him, I would argue that that is disrespect and mistreatment.
