Considering the state of our foster system, I would agree with you.  
And both of us entirely avoid the nuance necessary for a responsible debate on abortion.  
This debate is about religious fundamentalism and their argument that a zygote is a human is not supported by the science.  
All birth is forced from the perspective of the child. A better term is anti-abortion.  
Saying "you can't live in my belly" is murder? I'm sorry, dude.. but you don't have the right to live in my belly.  
It's self defense, not murder.  
Actually it's not illegal to attempt suicide, thank goodness.
