If compare the secondary school Chinese textbooks of Malaysia and Singapore side by side you'll realise that Singapore Chinese syllabus is really for babies That's because Malaysian Chinese secondary schools are Chinese-medium schools. No, even the Malaysian national syllabus (used by government schools, not necessarily Chinese medium, for students who elect to take it) is way harder than sg one. And remember, Malaysia has the strong presence of Chinese Educationalist Groups, notably Dong Zong (who are an extremely Chinese-oriented lot) who set the standards. In Malaysia, many Chinese people mostly go to Chinese primary schools (SRJK (C), which are national schools, btw) but go to Malay medium secondary schools (SMK) due to it being cheaper and easier to get into. Lastly, there is the type of fully Chinese medium school that you are talking about, Chinese independent high school (persendirian) that teaches everything in Chinese and has a separate set of exams not recognised by the Malaysian gov. I have done my fair share of research and it is stated that at least 90 percent of Malaysian Chinese do go to Chinese schools. Primary Chinese schools are in quite huge numbers and easily accessible. Secondary private Chinese education 90% figure however, I highly doubt it. Secondary public chinese education is even rarer and competitive, because it is the national system and does not require students to pay fees. And this Chinese SPM paper (national system, O levels equivalent) definitely is very much harder than HMT.
