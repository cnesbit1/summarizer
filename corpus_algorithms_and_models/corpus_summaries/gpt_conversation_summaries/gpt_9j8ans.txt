Honestly if kotkaniemi can stick and pot 50 points, and a few other key players bounce back, i dont think its entirely out of the question that montreal might be able to sneak into a wildcard spot.  Its alot of ifs but i feel like the potential is there.  
If price can be 2015 price they have a chance.  
Gallagher never played first line minutes, even when we had very little going for us like last season and he was over performing.
