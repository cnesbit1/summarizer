Although I'm not pleased they turned their back on a promise to keep the program running, I am happy to see the program end. Having a unsupportive government test a program will never be an effective method to gaining meaningful data. The program was doomed once the election results were in. At least theyâ€™re not pretending and wasting the money. No matter what happens with the first generation (all highly motivated and grateful to get free money) this will eventually devolve into another welfare plan given to entitled lazy people. The difference is that UBI and welfare gives you a stable income. With welfare, UBI and other similar socialist schemes, you're giving financial stability to the poor in hopes that they now have the safety net required to get their shit together, get an education and a good job so that, one day, they too will have a good enough income that it can be taxed and then turned into social nets for the other less fortunate. It just so happens that a lot of welfare programs actually create an inconvenient ceiling that makes improving your finances counterproductive in practice. UBI is an attempt to remedy this by changing the formula so that you're not forced into constantly applying to and accepting jobs that otherwise wouldnt be good fits, or falling into a financial dead zone where a job would leave you with less income at the end of the day. It wasn't really a great test though.  To be a true test you would need to have isolated the city entirely so that the low income would recieve money,  but the rich/ businesses would get taxed heavily to support them.   The current study just shows what giving people money does.  It doesn't show the side of what happens when taxes get increased heavily for certain groups. Would people move? Would businesses leave?  Would more low income move into area because of the handout?  This study was just about what people do when they get more money,  not exactly ground breaking If it's not exactly ground breaking then why was it cut before the results came in, the fact that it was cut despite Ford promising not to tells me he's scared of what it could reveal
