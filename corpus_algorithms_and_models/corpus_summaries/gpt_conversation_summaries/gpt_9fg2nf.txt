There are as many different types of vaginas as there are of penises. How would he feel if you made fun of his dick? Like condemn him for not having the perfect penis in your opinion. If he really judges you this way and does not care how it makes you feel, I (in your place) would strongly reflect if he is the right partner for you... This kind of attitude is why relationships fail. Husband is obviously wrong, but OP taking this route is immature and wont fix anything. The question is thus raised: is there anything left in this relationship that OP can fix? She's tried talking. Turnabout is the childish move. Adults should learn to move from fair to equitable. Be better. If you cant be 50/50 then you have to be willing to swallow the pride and take up the slack the other person doesnt take up and make arrangements if it continues to a point you cant handle. I don't think it's up to her to fix an abuser. I wonder how old they are, OP mentions "a few years" but who knows how long she means. If they are early 20s then it may just be immaturity and could get better in time. I got married at 20, did and said some stupid things. 34 now, still married and maturity is key. In your 20s you want to "get back" at the other person, later on you realize swallowing the pride and getting over it is worth WAY more than the 2 seconds of gratification from a delivering a "Fuck you!" to your significant other. But the other person needs to be on the same wavelength, which can be tricky. I dont think that is the case. This is verbal abuse plain and simple. She already made her point that it makes her feel ashamed. Why people defend someone who does this blows my mind. If I said something to my wife that made her feel ashamed I wouldn't be cold and uncaring about it I would try and fix it. People need to stop making excuses for verbal abuse. That isnt 50/50. Everyone makes stupid comments but the onrus is on them to rectify it when they see it hurts the other person, not shrug it off. That isnt a relationship. Just because one bad thing happens doesn't mean the entire relationship is broken. OP needs to sit down with their husband and explain how the comments made her feel. It's possible he was being flippant and insensitive but didn't intend to attack an insecurity like that. If he understood that saying that was going
