He has sent me a few hundred USD just to show me he’s “serious”. Soon after he warned me, ignoring him comes with consequences. I immediately told him to remove me on any social media he’s followed me on and delete my number. He demanded I give him his money back. After a few days I was able to do so with the help of my friends (I’m a broke photographer who works per gig) He has threatened to interviene in my show, stating “perhaps the audience will think it’s part of the show”. More threats followed after. I have him blocked on everything. He downloaded texting apps and is now harassing me through different numbers. After my friends and I furthered our research on this “very successful musical genius” we come to find Im not the first person he has threatened. In fact, the last girl he did this to was only 3 months ago. I am possibly the third, if not more. I don’t have anything from him directly stating physical harm. In the meantime I would contact the police and show them the texts. A mutual agreement between two consenting adults where money exchanges hands in return for whatever is totally fine. Threatening people is completely fucked though. But it should be a red flag when someone out of nowhere messages asking to be your "sugar daddy". A red flag that if he thinks he can buy you, then he might be possessive. And probably unhinged.
