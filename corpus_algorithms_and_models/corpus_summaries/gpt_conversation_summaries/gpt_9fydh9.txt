I then explained to him that the media and porn make it seem like you should be able to make me cum without a vibrator and that he shouldn’t feel bad that I use one.  
TL;DR: my boyfriend feels bad that I need to use a vibrator during sex to cum. Leave a comment letting him know that it’s ok and that media/porn is wrong.  
You do understand that many woman can only cum from clitoral stimulation right?  
If they told you you made them cum without clitoral stimulation they lied and did you a disservice.  
While there is an exception to the rule I know for a fact there is a existing “orgasm gap” because guys have this idea of how a woman is supposed to cum.  
It’s the ones who take the time to understand how to truly pleasure a woman that win.  
My boyfriend does this and, while he was feeling bad about it last night, I wrote this post in hopes that he will understand how common it is for woman to need clitoral stimulation and how uncommon it is for woman to cum exclusively through PIV.  
I mean there is a long history of men not really caring about woman or their wants.  
[Either way here is an article of how vibrators have evolved over the last 100 years.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4776588/amp/How-sex-toys-evolved-past-100-years.html) Theyve always been a thing.  
Edit: here is an article on the percentage of woman who cum with just intercourse alone. HINT: 20%  
20 FUCKING PERCENT. Let’s flip it a bit and you TELL ME how you would feel if you ONLY came 20% of the time you had sex?
