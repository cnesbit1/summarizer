If she says no you lose nothing. Ask 10 women, one will say yes.
For $1200 a month I'd definitely accept if it was a guy I already knew.
A lot of women would do that for 1200
The fact that you have offered enough random women money for sex to know the odds its kinda disturbing.
So that justifies harassing random women asking for sex in exchange for money? What???
If he wasn't a total psycho and it was literally 10 minutes each time and I just had to basically lay there while he did all the work, I might consider it. I wouldn't be doing any blowjobs or anal or anything. Condom on, a quick wham bam thank you ma'am, then I leave? Meh not too big of a deal.
That's called solicitation. There is definitely a legal risk to offering money for illegal services.
I sympathise with your undoubtedly tough situation, but...
I’m listening to the ‘This Past Weekend’ podcast right now (like, literally, as I type this), and Theo Von is interviewing a sex worker. She’s an escort, and while she wouldn’t be explicit about her rates, it costs well north of $500 an hour to spend time with her. And not all of her clients want to have sex, they want the girlfriend experience: dinner, TV or a movie, etc.
And ten minutes??? Damn, boy! I have an issue where it takes way too long, even after years with the same partner. At first girls think it’s great to be with someone who’ll bang them for an hour, but it becomes tedious for both of us. But this guy wanting ten minutes seems like he’s not only a hair trigger when it comes to getting off, but he can’t possibly know how to be someone worth fucking in the first place.
I get you man, lonely sucks. We all get to that point sometimes, but i don't think many would go through with it.
It's a numbers game. It will work eventually.
It's supposedly only a total of 2 hours of work in an entire month. It's not supposed to be your whole income . You think hoes have 3 dick appointments a week and pay their bills? Lol. That's sugar baby status and you'll have to do a whole lot more than just a quick 10 minute fuck a week to get that kind of treatment.
I mean, he could approach a woman who IS sex worker and have a 100% hit rate. But he's obviously not that smart.
It's $100 per encounter.
