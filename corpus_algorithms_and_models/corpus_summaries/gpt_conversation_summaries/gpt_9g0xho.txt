Anti-immigration is a completely valid political view, just as pro-immigration is. They are not synonymous. A person can be against *more* immigration. But now in this overly PC western culture, somehow if you aren't PRO immigration, you are a racist.

I think because usually the people **asking for less immigration** usually come across as **screaming for no immigrants** just for the sake of it. So when other people see that, they look like hateful bigots and racists hence the two become synonymous with each other.

It entirely depends on the reason someone is anti-immigration.

There are plenty of reasonable and calm anti-immigration proponents but they dont get any air time.

Because if you just paint someone as a racist, you don't have to address their arguments.

Unfortunately there's more than enough people around who refuse to acknowledge anything that questions our immigration system and why or how we do things as anything less than xenophobic racist bigotry, etc.

That's why people who are against immigration need to be more specific about what they are against and not just say they are anti-immigration because people paint broad strokes.

The problem is so much deeper than this.

So, in Canada if you want to argue for a policy that is similar to America's but different from Canada's you become an unpatriotic Canadian aka racist or bigot north of the border.

I value immigration restrictions not at all. It is a right of all people and any attempt by anyone to forcefully stop people from peacefully migrating is fundamentally wrong and I do not make any attempt at defending those who oppose them.

Because it depends on your reasoning for being anti-immigration, as well as the implementation youâ€™re demanding...

Because these days 99% of anti-immigration sentiments are said by people who have racist, sectarian, misogynistic, and homophobic sentiments.

For every Mitt Romney there are 100,000 David Dukes.

If other people misinterperet you it's possibly because more specifics are needed.

When you're surrounded by racists it helps to be more specific to make you stand out from the crowd.

I was under the impression that it's tough to get into the country, and that you need to have money and/or skills.

The first reason is moral and doesn't help our country in my opinion since we area already having a hard time taking care of our aging Canadian population.

Because companies are not willing to pay higher wages they just seek to get people to work for what they're willing to pay.

I always wondered, however
