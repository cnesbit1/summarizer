It's still great research as you learn alot about the way the town was evacuated.  
It appears they left Chernobyl like.  
They left immediately.  
They’re not getting any trouble from them, but the feds may see it differently.  
The abandoned cars got me .. the one at front gate looked like the door was even open.  
If it were “Chernobyl” like, they wouldn’t of came back and taken everything out of the buildings and houses.......they would have left everything as is.  
I honestly am really thinking they just wanted to close the place down, and this was the fastest, most efficient way.  
If funding was cut, they’d have to pull everyone immediately.  
The residents were most likely just staying on site because they were employees, scientists fir the observatory, or researchers, again, if funding were suddenly cut they’d have to leave immediately because it’s federal land.  
Sounds like they nearly gutted the place too.. quickly.  
It would seem like something along the lines of a contamination threat, but then the area would be quarantined.  
They had to send the FBI in a blackhawk to shut it down rather than emailing the staff there and telling them to close up shop?  
The sheriff was quoted as saying the FBI showed up in a Blackhawk.  
“But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there,” House told the newspaper.  
There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything.”
