So Tax cuts give money back to the American worker and cuts funding to the world.. If anything we need to cut our military spending and continue tax cuts. In fact labor should never be taxed only production and consumption should be taxed, this frees the worker and puts the burden on corporations and allows you to be taxed only on what you buy. These sorts of tax cuts donâ€™t help the average American. Trickle down economics is a lie. If you want tax cuts to help the greater citizenry then cut taxes on gas. Most households gained at least two hundred dollars in their monthly budget. You ask the question for an explanation.. by Taxing only Corporations and Consumption by purchases and dropping all labor based taxes you are putting most of the burden on the rich. What I mean by Funding the world is .. 1) being the worlds defense force and military police.. this cost a third of our debt. 2) Most aid programs are a joke.. the cost of a box of clothing that would cost 10.00 in a thrift store in the united states, costs the US after all costs attached somewhere around two grand.
