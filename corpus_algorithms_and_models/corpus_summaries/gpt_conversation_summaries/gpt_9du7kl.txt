The kind of person who will refuse to look at you because of an injury are the kind of people you wouldn't want to be with, anyways. Nineteen is still young, friend. I didn't have a serious partner until I was in my 20s. It seems like your self-confidence is very, very low. I would gently encourage you to focus on building up your esteem, and perhaps speak with a therapist, instead of letting yourself feel disappointed because you haven't had a partner yet. I am of the very, very firm belief that there is a lid for every pot. You're not broken - you just haven't found your lid yet. You will need to go online and screen really hard. Probably talk to some of your more experienced female friends about it. Basically you need to do little manipulative things to gage their behavior. As an example randomly say "no" to shit to see how they react to you withdrawing consent. This is the most important one, considering your self defense abilities are going to be hampered. If he gets angry or starts arguing/begging, you know you should have nothing to do with him. But beware that many good guys (not angry nice guys) also got enough of those game players and will screen those, too. Hey OP. I promise you your scars do not make you less beautiful. Someone who loves you will love you for your scars because they're part of how you became who you are. Find it in yourself to be honest and kind and positive.
