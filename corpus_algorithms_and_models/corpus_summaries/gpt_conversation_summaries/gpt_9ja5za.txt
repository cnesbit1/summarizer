Basically researching incels scares me and the way they hate women triggers me a lot as a two time rape victim. Rejection isn’t trauma. And it most certainly doesn’t justify, violence, rape, sex slaves and whatnot I’ve read from them. Yes being ugly (most of them aren’t, tbh) and therefore rejected feels awful. But it doesn’t justify all that hate. Not all of them are so horribly misogynistic and all that, of course. But there even is a tiny minority of them who’ll go as far as killing people. Rejection and depression do not justify misogyny and hate. And here we go again. That sounds like depression. NOT trauma. Rejection. Which is fine to say. It’s just ridiculous and insulting to call that a trauma Agreed, but that's a common reaction. In women, too, not just men. I agree, it is also insane and wrong. This hate mongering from BOTH genders has to stop.
