So I've lived in Singapore most of my life but my family never became Permanent Residents. After graduating high school I went abroad for college, and I'd visit my family on short-term passes most summer/winter breaks.

When I got to immigration the lady was immediately unfriendly, but I've encountered my fair share of unfriendly airport agents and everything usually turned out fine.

I took out my phone to check the time, and when I turned it off it made a click sound (just like all iPhones do), and when the lady heard it her demeanor suddenly flipped. She accused me of taking a photo (even though I didn't) and demanded I delete it.

From there her behavior just got so much worse, and her questions more accusatory. She noticed I was just in Singapore last week and asked what I was doing back so soon.

Then when we were passing by all the other travelers waiting in line at immigration, she yelled out "If you go traveling, don't throw tantrums" for everyone to hear.

At this point I was worried all the agents would treat me like some sort of suspicious criminal, but thankfully the actual agents that did my secondary inspection were much more polite.

After the whole experience I just felt really dehumanized. I used to think of Singapore as my home but now it feels like I'm not even allowed here.

I'm wondering if the immigration agent could've even flagged me as "difficult" or "insubordinate" or something.
