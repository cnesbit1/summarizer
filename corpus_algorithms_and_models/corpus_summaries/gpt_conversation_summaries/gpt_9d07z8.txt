Lol I’m 19 and my parents still think it’s too young to have a boyfriend..  
Truth is I’ve been together with my bf since sec one... should I just keep lying to them or what &gt;___&gt; gets inconvenient when I have to lie about my whereabouts  
Wow you hide six years already! How did you do that.  
My mum told my sis to get a boyfriend when she finishes uni 3 years later.  
You parent's tune will change past a certain age.  
Inside maybe they think it's fine, but the cultural belief that "it's always too early" is probably what is stopping them from accepting.  
Since you are in a long-term rs already, try to bring him over for fam dinner occasionally. Sooner or later they won't object too much to it.  
I think you can just tell them, of course, they'd still be worried. Mainly for daughters safety, and unwanted pregnancy.  
Their wedding is coming later this month and I'm invited.  
Happened to me too. My first bf was at 17 and she was so afraid that the guy will rape me or something. Then we broke up and at 19 during my clubbing days she thought I was a hooker. Lol When I turned 21 with a bf she asked when I’m going to give her grandkids. Moved in but didn’t marry at 24 and she got a shock when she found out we were sleeping on the same bed. What do you want, woman?!  
True but parents always have something to worry about. When I had my first bf they were afraid I’d get pregnant, (but interestingly they never bothered to teach me safe sex) but then they found out I was on the pill and got even more mad.
