I’ve only known this guy for like two weeks and we decided to have casual sex and all of the sudden out of no where with out asking he dead ass tries to suffocate me??! After I pushed his hands away from my nose he moves them around my neck.. like I’m pretty kinky but honestly consent and communication is super important and I’m kinda shook and upset rn just needed to vent idk.-.

Assault for trying to suffocate the OP. Read the original post, without consultation this guy tried to suffocate the OP and that is assault. It's nothing to do with the blow job.

Real BDSM involves confirming that your sex partner is ok with you doing specific acts before doing them. Outside of that circumstance what the guy did is assault.

It’s inconvenient to be groped or molested on a train and may not even physically hurt you but is still assault for a reason.

There’s a really big difference with choking/suffocating. It’s seen as this harmless kink, but it really is not. And there’s a reason a lot of people in bdsm won’t do it. It’s *deadly.* and just as if you were laying down and someone decided it would be hot to hold a pillow over your face, it’s barely okay to do with someone’s consent.

Yes. And in OPs case it’s the exact same as if someone held a pillow over her face. Just because she consented to his dick in her mouth, doesn’t mean she consented to not breathing.

Breath play isn’t some fly by night, I saw it in a porno and wanna try it! thing. It’s potentially *deadly*. And easily so. 

OP - I’m so sorry he did this to you. He sounds disgusting, and you have every right to be disturbed and upset.
