She's actually very pretty.  
Sounds like they handled it just long enough to get some and get the hell out of there.  
The question, to some extent, is why good looking woman with a stable personality is on Tinder. She'll have no problem getting all the sex she needs anyway, and plenty of men would stick around with a lovely girl.  
This is sexist and dated rhetoric.  
It’s crazy how she can’t see why men bang her and then leave.  
They obviously feel entitled to smash because they had to put up with so much crazy  
I mean, she viewed OP having to work for fifteen minutes as vanishing, so I doubt these guys really did abandon her as soon as they were done having sex.  
They probably had to go to work or get some food or something, and then found a crazy wall-of-text on their phones once they were done.  
One of the prettiest girls I know actually scares the shit out of me. Same sort of weird disassociated walls of texts.  
As a 40yo female: I was almost sympathetic for a minute. Because 30s/early40s guys do seem notorious for being like ‘yeah baby we so great together’ then ghosting as soon as they get the poon.

I ended up using donors for my kids. I’ve been raising my kids all by myself. I don’t even need a guy to pay bills/do anything with the kids. I really just need a guy for a consistent schedule of Netflix and chill. But even THAT is too much for guys, apparently.  
Ugh. Fucking ridiculous. Guys in this age bracket are either fresh out of a relationship or have never had a serious relationship...either way they just want sex, no commitment or responsibility. It’s a fucking nightmare for a single girl that wants a loving committed relationship. But yeah...back to the OP, best not to dampen your chances even further with unrealistic expectations.  
I missed the deleted comment, but you basically covered it. I do very much want a relationship with a guy, that’s all I’ve ever wanted. But it hasn’t worked out like that. And I damn sure didn’t want to die childless. So yeah, it was me v. fertility window and I chose to do it myself before it was too late.  
It's not that that's only what men are. Unfortunately and probably a painful
