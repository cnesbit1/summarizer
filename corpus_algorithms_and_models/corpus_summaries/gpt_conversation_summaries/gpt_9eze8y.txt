K-40, is the radioactive form of potassium, it is a beta emitter which means it undergoes beta decays and loses electrons and positrons. This isotope makes up one ten thousandth of the potassium found naturally. When it undergoes its beta-decay, the beta particle rarely makes it out of the surrounding potassium. 

When the atom finally loses enough electrons and positrons to destabilize the nucleus to argon-40 it emits a 1.46 MeV gamma ray.

"This 1.46 MeV gamma ray is important, as it allows us to identify when potassium 40 decays. The beta electrons leading to calcium, however, are not accompanied by gamma rays, have no characteristic energies and rarely make it out of the rocks or bodies that contain potassium 40." quote from [source](http://www.radioactivity.eu.com/site/pages/Potassium_40.htm)

Unlike the isotopes released from nuclear facilities, K-40 is a very low emitter and has a giga-year half-life, rarely emits ionizing radiation in its natural state.  Therefore, comparing this to exposure to an isotope like iodine-131 is extremely misleading and irresponsible to the public.
