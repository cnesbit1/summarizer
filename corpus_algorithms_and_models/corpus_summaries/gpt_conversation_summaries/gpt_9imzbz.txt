The local news here (I live in Pittsburgh) was having so much fun with Gritty tonight. They mocked him for a solid ten minutes, then there was a pause, and the sports anchor said “bias aside, I kind of love it” and there was general agreement. I honestly love it. It's so ridiculous and philly. I'm just glad they didn't go Chad Gnash on us So my wife just had a stroke of real genius. She figured they should have made the mascot a bulldog — like the broad street bulldog. With that said, I agree completely. It’s ridiculous and fun and everything a mascot should be. It's so ridiculous and such a bad idea in every way that I enjoy it. That being said, isn't the mascot supposed to be a pilot? I mean, I don't think the mascot is "supposed" to be anything. It's just a marketing tool...why not have some fun with it, yanno? I don't think it's a wholly bad idea because of the phanatic -- its in the same sort of theme, imo. I disagree, it's supposed to be representative of the mascot/team. The Penguins have a Penguin. The Caps have an Eagle. Even the Stars' alien makes sense. I don't even know what this thing is! Again, that all being said, it's so ridiculous that I enjoy it. I think it makes sense because of the Phanatic like I said...if the phanatic wasn't there it'd make zero sense, but since it's sort of the coke-addled 2nd cousin of the phanatic, it works!
