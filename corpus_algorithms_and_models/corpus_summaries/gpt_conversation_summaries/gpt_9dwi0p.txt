It's a non-religious public school in a blue state, so this was a surprise. He's in 9th grade. How do I make sure he gets an appropriate, scientifically accurate, well-rounded education? PornHub has a sex education series with a professional sex educator. It's great for the mid-teens and later crowd. PornHub is actually pretty hilariously socially progressive. If they can get people to be more open about sex then they'll probably get more users. Whoever said the slippery slope wasn’t real? The age of degeneracy is upon us. It’s normalising porn. It’s extremely mentally damaging. Look it up. Its not good mentally.
