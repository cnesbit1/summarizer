I'm curious how the 450's feel. Similar power delivery as the 600's, just obviously reduced across the rev range?  
I haven't spent any meaningful time on a 600.  Before this I've only had twins.  From that perspective, it feels like an SV650 with no torque and all the power at the top.  
It's more about the whole package, enough power to have fun with all the stuff that matters (suspension, brakes, ergonomics, 180+ tires, etc).  Plus it is economical, you can get multiple weekends out of a set of slicks.  
For those that don't want to google it. It's a 600 IL4 with one of the cylinders disabled to effectively make it a 450 IL3 with a 150 balance cylinder. Here in New Zealand, people do it to get a modern supersports into formula 3 and they are competitive.  
There's different ways to disable the cylinder. u/laserdiscmagic how was your one modified to run as a cripple triple?  
Cam lobe ground off.  
Damn, thatâ€™s super interesting, never heard of anything like that.  
The old method. Now people just do a dummy injector or a switch.  
I bought a cripple triple prepped track bike recently gonna be taking it to thill this coming Sunday! Can't wait !
