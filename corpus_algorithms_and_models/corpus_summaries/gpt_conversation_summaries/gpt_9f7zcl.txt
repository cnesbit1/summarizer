Exemplifying how Joe and Jane Average are cattle being led to the slaughterhouse.  
Everything is declining in quality due to the cancerous greed that has infected corporate America and yet we sit here taking it right up the ass and waiting for the next piece of meaningless junk to hit the shelves so we can race to spend our slave wages in the master's store.  
Public schools are in a crisis where education standards are declining rapidly, America is on the bottom end of the first world when it comes to public education.  
The sciences have become a morass of career driven nonsense.  
Healthcare is so ridiculously expensive as to be prohibitive for a large percentage of the nations population.  
Education may be declining in narrow scopes, but in aggregate America has never been more educated or had as much access to education thanks to open learning programs on this miraculous thing called the “internet”.  
The US public school system, a creation of robber barons, has never been a high benchmark.  
The US education system [is shit](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/american-schools-vs-the-world-expensive-unequal-bad-at-math/281983/), and what I said is a fact of history.  
No, the public school system has always been bad.  
In general it is poison for the genuinely intelligent, and things like standardized tests cripple its effectiveness.  
In many areas, that is the case.  
US schools have more police than counsellors.  
All the while the likes of DeVos and the Koch brothers are trying to choke funding to public education.
