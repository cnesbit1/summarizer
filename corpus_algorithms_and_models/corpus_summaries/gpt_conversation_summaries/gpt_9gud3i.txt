Well these guys hate the Russians as much as we do, let’s give them guns and training. I hope this doesn’t backfire

And they still have refused to finish Isis . Its taken over a year to make a move against them in the last towns they hold on the East Bank of the Euphrates. They bombed the Syrian and Russian proxies to smithereens though when they attempted to cross and take ground.Just goes to show how rotten the whole thing is.

OF course the west doesnt want to destroy the syrian rebels...that hands the region to assad, putin...and iran.

We are still dealing with the side-effects. Afghanistan part 2, Iraq, Boko Haram, even in Somalia the hand of the Mujahedeen can be seen.

There's a reason we call it the cold war though. Afghanistan, Iraq, Sahel, Somalia are all quite hot conflicts. I have to think on your statement here, as it seems to me that the current conflicts have way more impact globally. The cold war pitted US versus USSR in what was essentially a staring contest.

Obviously, ISIS is an alchemical creation. We were not winning in the mideast. Create an antithesis to form a thesis. Basic controlled opposition. Not even remotely secret, it’s more people don’t want to believe it therefore its not true. Wizards first rule. Obviously Russia will be vilified now, they are messing with their plans. As long as it doesn’t escalate, shit could get bad real quick.

because for a while isis were the most effective force vs assad.

Sounds like Al Qaeda versus the Soviets in the 80s, ya know the same group supposedly responsible for the 9/11 attacks. We funded them to defeat the Soviets. Then they attacked us and became our enemy. Same exact thing happening now with ISIS in Syria. Get a fucking clue.

The Russians aren't really that friendly to the US. Basically soft USSR. Much less of a threat but still not an easy trip in the fields.

My issue is that altering demographics and politics in countries to serve a temporary strategic asset, destroying those countries for the long run.

But we bombed isis under the Obama administration too...

They had a different name but we definitely were helping Bin Laden.

Haven't you ever heard of "Charlie Wilson's war?"  We were giving the Mujahadin in Afghanistan stinger missiles and training to shoot down Russian Helicopters.  Many of those same Mujahadin (including OBL
