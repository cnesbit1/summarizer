The league just started in Sweden, and if you go to a game of one of the teams with a bit more fanatic fans, this is what you normally get early season and playoffs. It's a common knowledge that NA fans are very mild, at least here. When I go to watch a hockey game live I can't imagine it without at least someone smashing drums for the whole game. American atmosphere:

Huge screen: "Let's go home team" 

Crowd: "Let's go home team"

And then silence until the screen tells to what to do again. If teams want a better atmosphere, all they need to do is stop playing music and videos and ads and instructions every time the whistle blows. People will figure it out. This is not true at all. There are plenty of fans who start their own chants in the middle of the game. Iâ€™ve been to countless Sharks games and chants start organically without the help of the jumbotron all the time. Go to a sporting event in Europe and you'll understand what he means. Since I moved to NA I've been constantly confused by the attitude at sporting events.
