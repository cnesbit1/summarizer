I would be too, except Sinemia is a much better deal and I just get actual cash back on my unaffiliated Mastercard that rolls right into my chequing or savings accounts at my bank.  
I have a 4% grocery rewards one from CIBC and every liquor store, Convenience stores, Steam, Spotify etc. show up as groceries on my statement  
No, sorry for being unclear. I meant that getting your Cineplex (or wherever) tickets from Sinemia is way cheaper than *anything* that gets you SCENE points.  
I make well over CAD $1000 per year back on the credit card and my movies cost a small fraction of retail.  
Cards affiliated to one kind of purchase get you more "points" (or dollars) for those purchases but then have teeny tiny less than a percentage point returns on everything else.  
For a card I just use the generic cash back Mastercard from my bank, and since it's specifically a Mastercard and not a Visa, I can use it at all the grocery stores that don't take Visa as well as COSTCO warehouses (including fuel stations).  
Sinemia is not Canada wide right now, otherwise would be a great deal.  
Sinemia is Canada wide. If you don't have cinemas in your area, you should request them. They sometimes add theaters on demand  
I'm just happy my christmas shopping is "free" from cash back since I'll always want to pay off a bill but not always watch a movie
