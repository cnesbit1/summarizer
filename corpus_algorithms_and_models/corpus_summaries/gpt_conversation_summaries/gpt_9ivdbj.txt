It makes me wary that men are taught from a young age to both desire women and to disrespect them, and when I look at porn I can't help but notice the linguistics of the titles (5 guys *destroy* teen slut, man *ruins* 18-year old, etc). 

Separately, the actual mechanics of sex that involve a man inserting a penis into a woman -- I love the feeling of this, but sometimes feel as though this is an act being done *to* me, that I/women are essentially objects while men are the active subjects. 

I really don't see power dynamics in our bedroom.  We listen to one another.  We do all sorts of kinky shit, but it's mutually decided on. 

But I don't think this is a requirement for sex. 

Meh.  Pro porn is largely bullshit, anyway.  Just because some people are into that doesn't mean that is how sex actually is. 

People are people.  Our genitals fit together a certain way, yes, but sex should be an active partnership if everybody is going to be happy. 

Find someone that respect you, that you respect, and have whatever sort of sex you both enjoy. 

I agree that most porn is bullshit, but it's also the case that a lot of people watch porn when they're pretty young and don't know that that's not how real sex is, and get it into their head that it is, which I think is a shame. 

I totally agree that sex should be an active partnership! I'm all for no default settings and mutual respect. 

I think that critical thinking is a skill that needs far more practice than it currently gets. 

I appreciate that you have a more neutral-positive view of sex with no clear power dynamics based on physiology, I wish that was more the case. 

I think you're using a flawed definition of object, then, if you rule that a person loses their agency, despite freely choosing to be an active participant in something, simply because something is being done to them. 

I understand that it feels gross, but believe me it feels grosser as a woman who has been told not to walk alone at night, to ever leave my drink alone, to have my headphones in in an area that isn’t crowded. 

Women are constantly told both that 1) We shouldn’t distrust men, how dare you paint us all with this brush and 2) We need to be vigilant in case they try to hurt us.
