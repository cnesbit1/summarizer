Why would a pair of handcuffs be contraband, especially a novelty pair such as these?  
Presumably they think you’d try to hold the pilot hostage?? TSA is very tetchy??  
As a former airport security officer (though in Finland), I wonder this too. In training, we were specifically told handcuffs are not on the no-fly list.  
Not a contraband *per se*, but a potential hazard to the flight crew. So any forbidden object that makes it past security could be considered contraband.  
Australian Border Security, that's why. I was born in Australia and lived here all my life. It's the *only* country I've been questioned when re-entering even though I travelled on an AU passport.  
Something to do with being able to aid in the hijacking of a plane or some bullshit. I think the public humiliation was enough of a punishment but the authorities thought not. At least I’m not gunna be on the new season Of border force.
