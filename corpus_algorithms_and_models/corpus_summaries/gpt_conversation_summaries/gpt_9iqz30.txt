Science only tells us what is or how something is, not what ought to be.  
If you think science will lead to a more liberal future, boy are you solely mistaken. Religion is only part of the morals and ethics in human history/cultural, but like religion, science can be taken to extremes.  
Science alone isn't bad. Science is science. Morality is morality. Morality has nothing to do with science. Morality is a social construct, much like religion. Science is knowledge. And FYI, science does not dictate resources be directed to most productive or eugenics. People do based on their morals.  
If you think about it, there have been thousands and thousands of different religions throughout time. Civilizations with seemingly little to no contact somehow share many common morals despite having completely different religions.  
Some very bad decisions in the past were made on the basis of religion as well, take stoning for blasphemy, for instance.  
You are right that science does need morality, but why must it come from religion? You did agree that not all morality and ethics come from religion, but keep in mind that doesn't mean the ethics that religion teaches comes only from religion.  
Science does not look at good or bad because it needs to be clear of bias. An example would be homosexuality. Science has proved that it is not a disease that can be cured. It is an aspect of who they are as a person. Most religions claim it to be a sin but science proved the facts behind homosexuality without thinking whether it would be good or bad to do so. Now people are inferring that homosexual people shouldn't be ostracized and homosexuality isn't a question of morals.  
Morals is just a set of social rules people follow so we don't fuck things up for one another, where cooperation is seen as a necessity to not make ourselves go extinct.
