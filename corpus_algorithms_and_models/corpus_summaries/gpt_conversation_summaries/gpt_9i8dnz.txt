Feels good having a guy that can clap bombs accurately again. I swear it's been since Lidstrom since someone could do that on this team. It's amazing how much a guy like that changes an entire PP. There's just a world of difference between the teams that have one (Ovi, Laine, Stammer etc) and teams (like us) that don't. Those PP goals will win you games, having Zadina should greatly increase our very lackluster PP of the last couple years. I had high hope for Pulkkinen to fill that void. Better late than never. Pulkkinen had an awesome clapper too, if it was on target. I'm sure Tarasenko could send clappers like that if he wanted to, but he's always looking for a quick snapper. Our pp has been shriveled up into a chode the past like 3 years or whatever. I heard this Zadina kid has a fricken wrench to fix that though.
