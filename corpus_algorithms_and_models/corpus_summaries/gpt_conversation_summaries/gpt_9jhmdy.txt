When people show you they're misogynist assholes, just block and move on? I don't know what people are trying to gain by arguing with people like this. You're just giving them what they want.  
By continuing to talk she is reinforcing his behavior, albeit in a perverse way.  
With horrible people like this on the internet the best thing you can do is ignore.  
Because by giving him attention, he wins. You win by not giving him what he wants, which is for you to respond.  
I knew that even if I shut this one scammer up, another would turn up with the same weasel games in mind; this woman knew the same about this thirsty, lame, sad-ass neg artist.  
I knew that my time was mine to spend as I pleased, and I chose to do so amusing myself seeing how much I could make a desperate little monkey dance, that was my prerogative because I wasn't the one who chose to be a monkey in the first place; exactly the same applies for this woman here.  
But at the same time, you're enabling that behaviour. For him, it's a numbers game now  
I’ve had a couple instances where they just make a new account to harass you, find you on Facebook, etc. So unfortunately that’s not always possible.  
Baiting assholes is fun for some of us in some situations.  
I block people ALL the time. It comes down to I wanted to see how far these types of guys would go. He has been blocked.  
thinking that someone can 'win' at a conversation is why interactions like this happen.  
trying to beat someone at a last word contest is just bringing yourself down to their level.  
It's fun to fuck with people  
Can't you see you're just encouraging him? Now he's more likely to do this in the future to other girls.  
I'm pretty sure there's no win for you anywhere in this game. They're never going to stop their behavior no matter what you do.
