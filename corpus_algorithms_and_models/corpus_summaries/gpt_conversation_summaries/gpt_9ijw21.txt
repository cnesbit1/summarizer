Yesterday I was driving home from work on the road I take to and from work every single day in my car and had a group of riders come flying up behind me. They all passed me on double yellow lines, then proceeded to slow to a STOP on a 65 mph road to let 4 other riders in front of me that were stopped at a T intersection, then continued until the next intersection riding wheelies and weaving in and out of the oncoming traffic lane to get around one another. Once at the next intersection, the same few guys that blocked the first intersection sat in the oncoming traffic lane to block cars (Again, 65 mph lane) to allow the whole group to continue. If you’re going to do this on public roads and endanger yourself, your passenger as well as others on the road, to me, another rider, you’re absolutely the worse of the worse. Don’t endanger others lives. Plain and simple. Mods should put up a "I want to vent about random shit" mega thread every week. There isn't an activity that exists that doesn't have assholes doing that activity any given time. We've all experienced assholes. Most of us have probably been assholes at some point. Your post isn't convincing anyone not to speed and pass over double yellows. Hoons gonna hoon. Mods should put up a "I want to vent about random shit" mega thread every week.
