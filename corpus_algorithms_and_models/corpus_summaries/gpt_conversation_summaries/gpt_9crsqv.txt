Whenever my husband and I have sex, he says that he can't feel anything during because my vagina is too loose. I've tried everything: kegel exercises, regular exercise, diet change, ben wa balls, other tools. and different sex positions. My husband says he is sexually frustrated from having bad sex and he doesn't have an orgasm, even though semen comes out. He'll need to hit all the avenues. Medical check up, cut back on masturbation, consider marriage counseling. If he is ejaculating during sex, clearly there's enough stimulation occurring to cause an orgasm. Thank you for the thoughtful response. He has mentioned that he has stopped masturbating and looking at porn for a while now, about a month, and he recently started to have less of a sex drive resulting from it. So he started to become less interested in sex, also doesnt help that hes always working and too tired to really do much now. It can take up to few years. For reals, you are not to blame you of this. As I heard from sexologists, the key is to force yourselves to have relationships, everyday. At least of some kind. Eventually, the drive will come back. This has to be everyday. Couple's counseling and a frank discussion is in order, I think.
