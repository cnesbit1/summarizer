Jesus Christ, this is insane..
We must continue to speak out and condemn this witchunt
Reminder that as the left goes further left, the center becomes "the right".
If a LARP it can do no harm right? Banning them only proves that they have been right all along.
The mods of banned subs have done a great disservice to their members by not having a back-up plan in place.
However I am big on not censoring anyone including people with extreme views whether that be on the left or the right
I think the gist of what u/mrsuns10 is saying is that there is a serious discrepancy in what Reddit decides to keep and what to ban.
I imagine if the rules were adhered to and enforced without bias, we wouldn't be having this conversation now.
Reddit is left leaning.
This is a fact.
Just because there are 5 hard left threads does not mean they tread the same water and engage in the same behavior as MDE, KiA, T_D, GA, Cringe, etc.
If you have stupid ideas that you want to share on public forums, people are going to catch on and call you on them.
This is America.
If you believe in the sanctity of free speech and the right to share any opinion, face the fucking music when people aren't a fan of what you have to say.
And why decentralized platforms are so important.
Give me a break.
That subreddit was spewing very dangerous lies.
Freedom of speech is dying because of you fairies.
The highly right leaning military-industrial complex.
Reality does have a liberal bias.
If you're a Republican, you should be ashamed about what's happening and what your party is doing to negatively affect our country.
If you're a Trumpublican, a follower of the disgraceful cult of personality, carry on.
