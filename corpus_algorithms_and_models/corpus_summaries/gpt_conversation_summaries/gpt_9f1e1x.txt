Bracing for some power loss here in Durham  
I'm in Durham too. I'm looking at all the trees around my house and seriously second-guessing my housing decisions.  
Haha my bed is on the side of the house with trees towering over, I’m sleeping on the couch on the other side of the house for the next few nights  
I'm on Wake Electric and not Duke Energy. I'll be out of power for probably a week. I lost power for a short period yesterday just by looking at a hurricane tracker website.  
if you are in Durham NC (or the Triangle) from Fullsteam Brewery on FB:  
&gt;Need water in preparation for the impending storm? We are happy to fill your containers. Enter through Madison St. and introduce yourself to any of our friendly brewery crew. If they're there -- before, during, or after the storm -- we'll give you filtered water.  
Also in Durham. We live on what we had been calling a “nice wooded lot”, but as of last week it’s a “goddamned wooded lot”.  
Live in Apex. We bought a house with a lot of mature trees. Matthew didn’t knock any down completely but lots of branches. We thinned it out so only the stronger woods remain. I’m still nervous af right now since there’s one tree that we were quoted 5k to take down is still up.
