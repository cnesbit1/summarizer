I was there for drug use and scitzophrenia. I was paranoid cops where after me and that people could hear my thoughts. So I thought this man named Chris was a cop so we played a basketball game of pig. After I missed all three shots he turned to me and asked.. do you know Mother Teresa? I then went into his room and he wanted me to read this single page from revelation. I then read one line from the middle of the paper which read he who holds the world and handed it back to him. I later went outside to smoke a cigarette and I sat next to him and without me paying any attention he elbowed my elbow. I also thought she was a cop so I would talk to her and be nice to her. She sat by me and at the end of the meeting we were about to hold hands and say the Lord’s Prayer and summer put her head down and said I’m sorry. I was then mopping the floor and I saw summer walk the vinyl line. I then had the thought.. what if I kill you? I then heard a voice in that sounded like hers say.. pewwwww boom. I then went to bed. It was either that night or a a few nights later I was sound asleep and I woke up to what felt like someone or something was holding my head to the side to where I couldn’t move and I felt something bite my neck. I then became angry and several moments later I kept thinking I’m gonna kill you.
