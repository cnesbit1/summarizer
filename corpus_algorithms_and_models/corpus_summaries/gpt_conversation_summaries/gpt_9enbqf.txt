I know most people here probably hate The Donald, but I want to give some kudos to them regardless. Say what you want, but Trump made a lot of people **question the narrative** which in my view is an incredible achievement. Just how much he moved in this regard struck me when a popular MSM host, Tucker Carlson, was allowed to bring a whole piece about the last [staged attack in Douma](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cSGf2ZpDENU)

Imagine if someone did that on CNN, MSNBC, CNSBC and how they're all called.

You contribute to T_D an awful lot for someone who isn’t a Trump supporter

Give me a fucking break. It is literally the Donald Trump propaganda dissemination subreddit.

Trump cultists have been trying so hard to play this “both sides” bullshit for the past 2 years, trying to make their own viewpoints actually seem legitimate or equal to rational thinking.

I’m not sure why you’re trying to conflate “entertaining a thought” with actively participating and contributing to spreading and upholding those thoughts and ideas.

Furthermore, you’d be an idiot to “entertain a thought” in every single scenario, especially when someone is being misleading or deceptive. You posit that all thoughts and ideas are on equal footing.

There's a big difference between hypothesis, thoughts, theories and *political opinions*. But you don't know that, it's either BLUE or RED. Killary is innocent, but Trump must die in prison because CNN told me so! Never have a debate, always try to shut them up before arguments happen.

You can disagree with a side but still appreciate certain viewpoints of them.

I like how you mentioned his user name so if he winds up deleting his comment we'll all know who it was.  Excellent work there, u/supranational_stoner.  

FYI, I almost exclusively listen to conservative talk radio when I'm in the car.  I find it helpful to know in advance what every single one of my conservative co-workers will be parroting later.  I have no problem with entertaining thoughts I don't agree with.  However, what happens over in T_D isn't "thinking".
