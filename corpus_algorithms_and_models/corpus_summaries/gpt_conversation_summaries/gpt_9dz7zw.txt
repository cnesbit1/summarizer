A friend of mine believes that there's nothing you can do, that is that bad for God to send you to Hell, and I share this view, but now I'm curious what would happen to someone like Hitler? Would he be forgiven for the bad things he did? Would he be sent to Purgatory? Or would he go to hell?

Hitler is not a worse sinner than you and me.

Yes he is. I’m sorry but I never murdered millions of Jews, millions of homosexuals, black people, and those who didn’t have blond hair and blue eyes.

That parable is about humility and pride.

It's hardly a matter of pride to know that you haven't committed some of the most heinous crimes in the history of humankind.

However if God is perfect as the Bible says, then any amount of sin makes us the worst criminals equally.

There’s a lot of false doctrine in Christianity and that is one of them.

If you break the smallest part of the law, you are guilty of breaking it all

Its almost like when it becomes acceptable to believe things that don't make sense as long as a religious tradition says it that many of them will veer into bizarre nonsense.

Even if that means you did, that still doesn’t mean all sins are equal.

EvErY SiN iS EqUaL iN Gods EyEs.

That is the most ridiculous thing ever.

Paul said he was the chief of sinners.
