It's essencially masturbating in the face down position and can cause problems in sex, like being unable to cum.  
Face down masturbation creates a pressure and sensation that are unachievable in other positions (mostly because of body wait and the angle of the penis being pressed into the mattress/whatever). Doing this and only this for long periods of time can make it difficult to find other sensations, like sitting up and jerking it, or actually sliding your dick into a vagina, feel muted and not as pleasurable. It’s the same principle as death grip, with the added danger of the constant pressure and weight potentially causing nerve damage.  
Edit: prone masturbation is frequently the way most adolescents, male and female, discover masturbation, but most people grow out of it fairly early on as they move on to other sensations. It also has the potential to create problems for women who do it as well.  
You’re very young and as long as you don’t do it frequently in the prone position from now going into adulthood I don’t imagine you’ll have any problems at all. It’s a natural progression for many people to start with prone and move on to other things. From what I’ve read, the men who have issues because of it have been doing it with frequency for years.
