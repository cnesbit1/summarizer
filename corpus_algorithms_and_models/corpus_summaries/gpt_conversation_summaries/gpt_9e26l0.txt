Coincidentally, the exact question for my project is if Auschwitz-I is a popular place amongst Singaporeans.  
Have been to Auschwitz twice both on school trips with overseas university. Intriguing aspects and correlation to Japanese occupation of Singapore and their internment in camps in the US.  
I was fascinated by World War history more than dark tourism, it added perspective to my relatively sheltered Singaporean life.  
Am Singaporean, have been there, have quite a number of friends who've been there.  
Surely! Didnâ€™t expect this much people to show interests or even experiences of visiting Auschwitz.  
My friends and I are twenty-something university students. Most of us went there while on exchange studies, traveling Europe.  
I guess my demographic would be most likely to show interest in places of historic importance.  
Schools bring students there quite often in the past IIRC. Until MOE cut budget and no more subsidized trips to europe lol  
Have been to Auschwitz. Really somber experience, reminded me alot of Schindler's list.
