This happened on Sunday, and I’m still suffering. Anyways, Sunday night my friend, we will call him Greg, texted me. He said he’s paranoid and super drunk, and this guy is walking around his house with a rifle. I offer to come to his house and take care of him. Greg is sitting on his living room floor, laughing hysterically at how cute his dogs are, the gun is propped by the door, and loud rap music is playing. We’re all just ducking around, a bunch of 20 something’s, and Greg shows the bottle of cheap liquor he’s been sipping on for the last couple days. Just some 100 proof Vodka. I’m fully clothed in a jacuzzi full of bubbles, wearing Greg’s motorcycle helmet ( Pic Included here: https://i.imgur.com/80zq9Jv.jpg ). So, I take Prozac and Elavil. For those of you who don’t know (much like my blissfully unaware self at that time) you are **not supposed to mix alcohol and antidepressants.** I’m convulsing on my friend’s concrete floor, and then I vomit and stop shaking for a minute. I’m laying on the stonework floor of the shower, hot water raining down on me. I’m on the floor, and now I’m covered in towels, and Kyle tells me I ripped off my shirt shortly after the shower ended. I’m then wrapped in more towels so I’m not just swinging titty around like a damn carousel, and then I’m carried to Greg’s bed where I proceed to vomit in a trash can and pass out. I get home by 7:20, take a shower to hopefully rinse off the ungodly scent that has implanted itself into my very being. I’m still drunk. I go through all of my classes, still drunk. I’m fucking feverish, I feel like I’m gonna puke, I’m fucking*covered* in bruises, customers are asking stupid questions, and I wrote a bitchy passive aggressive note to my supervisor about how I’m sick of her shit. TL;DR I drank in excess, and blacked out, had seizures from my meds mixing with it. Go to work hungover. Might lose my job.
