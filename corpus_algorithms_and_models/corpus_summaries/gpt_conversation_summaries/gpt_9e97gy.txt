Actually, I was watching this French show on Netflix called Call My Agent. The main plot of the story is that the main character is an older accomplished actress. She is getting passed over for younger actresses for casting and sponsorships simply because of her age. The agents at the talent agency tip toe around her trying not to tell her that the reason why she aren't getting signed is because of her age.

Yup. As a person living in France, I don't 100% agree with op's post as much as it sounds beautiful. Business is business though. A society's values are not exactly represented in a TV drama. Of course television will want to put the most beautiful people on screen. That still does not take away from valuing a person as a sexual being. That actress may not be the youngest or prettiest, but I think the point here is that there is no expiration date on her ability to be desired, not to work.

Exactly. France isn't some island of non-ageism. This comment should be way higher. Instinctively skeptical about such far reaching affirmations

While I think there is some truth to the point about French people aging gracefully, and with style; as a visitor, I feel the people have a greater awareness of style at any age. It’s a part of their culture. And yes it’s awesome. I really appreciate its.
