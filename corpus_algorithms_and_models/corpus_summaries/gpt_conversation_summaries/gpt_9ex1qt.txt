Everyone loves showing off their bike and gear, so here is a dedicated thread just for that. If you've just bought a new bike, new gear or have a collection of images related to that, post them below for other Rideitors to enjoy! Of course, if you have a great story to tell and an album with good captions to go along with it, you are still welcome to post it in the main subreddit. This thread will be refreshed every other Monday. Got licensed and got a bike. 2015 FZ-09. I’m in love with riding! I have only been riding on street a few weeks. I've rode dirt bikes my whole life. The jacket is nice for when it’s hot. It’s really light and has good airflow. I have two other jackets. One for winter and one with more padding and a rain liner. The jacket in the image is from Joe Rocket. Best upgrade you can make for it are some new fork internals and a shock out back. Enjoy. Head on over to [fz09.org](https://fz09.org) forums if you haven't seen em yet. An excellent resource for any questions you may have, and a pretty good community of riders.
