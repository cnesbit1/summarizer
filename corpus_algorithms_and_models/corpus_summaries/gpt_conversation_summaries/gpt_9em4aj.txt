There is an excellent and long thread over at Above Top Secret that claims to have some inside info from folks who've called local newspapers in the area. It's a pretty wild scenario that leads me to believe that the government is using the observatory in the name of national defense, possibly to keep an eye out for a new Russian space threat. ATS actually had one of the most eye-opening threads ever, in my opinion, in the last few years. It was by a gentleman claiming that the Phoenix Lights craft, and others like it, are essentially "Mind Hoovers", and they utilize the consciousness of millions of beings to store and then recapture star map data. He's talking about the Astro thread. Seriously my favorite thread ever. You'd have to read it to understand, but he definitely knew seriously sensitive information. Astro has not been heard from since. Indeed! The Astro thread containing the info on the Mind Hoovers is easily one of the best. I would take everything from ATS with a heavy dose of salt now. Several years ago they had culling of sorts and banned multiple contributors. Now it seems like it's been largely co-opted by the intel agencies as a outlet for misinfo. Hearing this being linked to a russian "threat" just furthers my suspicion.
