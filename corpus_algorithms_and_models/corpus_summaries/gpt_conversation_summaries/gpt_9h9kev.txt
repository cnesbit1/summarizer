I am hoping I can even draw beyond the first week ;A;  
I didn't go past the first 3 days for last year... maybe this year!  
iirc you no need to do every day, like once a week also can  
Oh! I thought Inktober is like, a drawing/doodle a day xD.  
I haven't drawn in like 5 years since I got burnt out on O level art and I've been wanting to get back into it. Any suggestions on how to do inktober?  
&gt;1) Make a drawing in ink (you can do a pencil under-drawing if you want).  
&gt;2) Post it*  
&gt;3) Hashtag it with #inktober and #inktober2018  
&gt;4) Repeat  
&gt;Note: you can do it daily, or go the half-marathon route and post every other day, or just do the 5K and **post once a week**. What ever you decide, just be consistent with it. Inktober is about growing and improving and forming positive habits, so the more youâ€™re consistent the better.  
&gt;*Post it on any social media account you want or just post it on your refrigerator. The point is to share your art with someone.

TIL my ladyboss isn't really my ladyboss. She is the mistress of my boss, working in the same company. And my colleague is the ex-brother in law of my boss' ex-wife.  
EDIT: forgot to add that... ex-brother in law has to work hand in hand in the same department with *ladyboss* :)  
wow must be really awkward at work  
Bro in law is his ex-wife's brother.
