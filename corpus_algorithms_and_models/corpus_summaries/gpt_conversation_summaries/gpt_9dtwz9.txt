It's best to look at year over year data. This year we lost 51.6k jobs. You have to look at the longer term trend. I should have said "*this year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August.*" I should have said "in the past two Augusts, we averaged 24k new jobs" "This year, we lost 51.6k jobs in August" You have to understand what "unemployment" means - First there's population, and out of that population only a certain amount of people are in the labour force (people between age 16 and 65 who's not in school or a stay at home parent, or unable to work due to disability, etc) and then out of all those people, those that are recently looking for jobs in the last 3 months are considered "unemployed" and the % between those that are looking for jobs in the last 3 months vs the labour force is the unemployment rate. What this means is that A) despite population going way more then 22K, it doesn't mean that all those people are employable (toddlers, retirees, for example) and B) for the last two years before we got around 22K less people looking for jobs in August then now. Looks like our population is outpacing employment.
