I like who I am, but I don't like being called creepy and annoying.

Don't ask for advice if you're going to argue everything.  
Dude you cannot even understand the most simple things.  
If you don't like to ve called creepy or annoying, a good place to start would be to stop annoying people who just want to mind their own business.  
People's emotions, thoughts, feelings all change with alcohol.  
I also have Autism. I am trying to think out of that box.
