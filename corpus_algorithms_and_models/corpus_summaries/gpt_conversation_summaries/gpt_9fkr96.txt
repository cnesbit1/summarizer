Sharks are now the Apex predator of the Pacific  
It’s a tight race for the second Pacific spot  
And the Flames are looking really good too  
Ugh not if these California teams keep landing star players.  
Ducks have no Kessler, a Corey Perry that aged like milk since Carlyle got hired, then you have to factor in Gibson's annual groin injury Ducks are below the SHarks, Kings, Knights in terms of power I wouldnt even be shocked if Arizona finally gets their shit together and out does them this year. Anaheim has never looked this mortal before  
except for last season when half the team was AHLers and yet still made it to 2nd in the Pacific ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
