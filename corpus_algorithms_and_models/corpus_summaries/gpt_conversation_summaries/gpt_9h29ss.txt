Please, at least discuss these feelings with your SO. Maybe it can be fixed. But don't settle because it's easier then leaving.  
Start with yourself, all problems are not external but internal.  
This is bullshit. A friend of mine got out of an abusive relationship where her husband broke her finger so badly she will never regain full use of it. Him beating her was *not* an internal problem on her part and no amount of self-improvement could stop him from being a piece of shit.  
You're right of course. And also, if you look at _everything_ from a perspective of *What am I learning right now*, then you nearly always have to acknowledge the existence of both the internal and external.  
Having been in this circumstance, please leave dude.  
You're kind of acting like an abusive relationship doesn't involve mental abuse that compromises the abusee's ability to have clear logic like that.  
Abusive relationships are certainly complex.  
_"You can learn with joy, or you can learn with pain. But either way, you're going to learn."_  
You cannot control what happens to you. You can only control your response to whatever happens to you.  
Responsability = Ability to respond effectively  
Your external situation only changes from internal change (at least very effectively)  
I recommend the book "7 Habits of Highly Succesful People"  
My circle of influence grew with me.  
It's easy to check who accomplishes more in life. Those people focusing on internal factors, that are in their grasp, or those that focus on external factors.
