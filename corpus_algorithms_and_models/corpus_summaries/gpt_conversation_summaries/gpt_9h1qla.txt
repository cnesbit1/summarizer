Aberfoyle is a small community outside of Guelph which had 50% of it's groundwater purchased by Nestle. However, the Ontario Wynne government approved Nestle for a permit to extract 3.6 million litres of water daily (early). I am asking for /r/Canada to raise awareness and support (starting within our own online community) for laws protecting our fresh water resources from corporation and encouraging sustainability. 3.6 million L/day isn't much relative to municipalities' daily groundwater extraction, although I don't think we should be helping bottled water thrive as an industry. Water bottle eco-tax would help discourage people from buying bottled water. Doug Ford may even be for this cause due to the massive expense of waste burden and low revenue in exchange for the natural resource. It would also subsidize source water protection efforts. In addition to the highest quality of drinking water treatment and monitoring, Ontario has the largest supply of fresh water in the world! Well water is the cleanest water source and generally doesn't need any treatment. Ontario had a tragic incident where a whole town was poisoned by municipal water. Now we have the most stringent and comprehensive standards.
