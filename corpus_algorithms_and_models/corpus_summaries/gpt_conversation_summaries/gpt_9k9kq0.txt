Given his history, anything less than 10 games would seem kinda low. Honestly there's no place for this shit in the game, throw the book at him, and anybody else doing this shit. Completely blindside, player is defenceless... just gutless. You aren't allowed to hit the head regardless. The onus is on the hitter. That's the rule, deal with it. 10 seems right. Similar to the Matt Cooke warning. And he took the message...for a little while. After this, itâ€™s Torres time. 30 games. Other than the players safety and attempting to limit the amount of careers that are shortened or ended by shit like this, right? Humans do not have 360 degree vision. There will always be a blind side, no matter swivel-y your head is. The responsibility is on the player making the hit. If this was a clean body hit in open ice that Sundqvist didn't see coming because he had his head down, it would be clean. That's not what happened. Wilson drove his shoulder straight through his head. The fact that Sundqvist didn't see the hit coming and couldn't brace for it (defenseless) makes the hit worse. If this was the same hit but driven through the shoulder people would still be complaining about it, because they don't understand the rules or that it's a puck carrier's own responsibility to defend themselves from (non head-targeting) hits from **any** direction. I think going beyond 10 would be a good idea, to set the tone for the regular season and let everyone know the league isn't fucking around.
