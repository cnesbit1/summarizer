Four weeks ago from today, I (21,F) got really drunk. When I was sitting with A and her work friends, this guy introduced himself to me as “C” so I said hi. So anyway we’re walking to his car and he says, all of a sudden, “Wait the cops are out and they just drove past us 4 times because we both stumbled, let’s not drive somewhere” so I say, “Oh okay..”. So we put our arms around each other and walk around the town and then we go to this cemetery and I can’t remember who initiated this but we start making out on the grass and he started fingering me and I said, “stop” and he would stop for a little then just keep going at it. So then we walked some more, I was holding on to him because I could barely walk, but he kept saying “let’s go back to your dorm, I can make you feel so good” and i kept saying, “no” and he said, “come on” and I’m said, “no my roommates are gonna think badly of me” and then he wore me down and I said, “when we go back we’re just gonna hang out and talk, right” and he said “yeah”. We get in the door to my room and he said “I want to see you naked” and starts unstrapping my sandals. And he said “let me rub my dick on your pussy” and I remember crossing my legs because I didn’t want him to enter me. But I said “okay yeah you can” But like he just kept rubbing his dick closer and closer to my vagina and I was said “what are you doing?” And this is crazy but I was thinking to myself “Well, he’s so close to my vagina anyway maybe I’m already not a virgin because of this so I might as well let him do it” so I said “okay you can put it in”. We had sex. When we were like having sex I said “stop” and he stopped moving but he kept his penis inside of me. Afterwards, he said “don’t tell anybody ever about this. everything we did was consensual right?” and i was like “well i was kind of drunk and you were rubbing it close to my vagina” and he was like “well i was drunk too remember i had 2 beers tonight (THIS WAS HOURS BEFORE)” and i was like “well okay”.. I'e just felt really bad about this for
