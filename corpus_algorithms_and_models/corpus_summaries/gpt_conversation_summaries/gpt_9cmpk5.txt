I appreciate what they’re doing, but the hosts are usually so cringe-worthy that it’s hard to listen to. So often I hear them make some horrible cringe-worthy joke and then they all fake laugh about it like it was sooo funny, but the laughs are even cringy and fake sounding. I just feel like they’re so disconnected from reality when on the air that it’s even caused me to struggle in the past with whether or not I belong in this church culture. Poor theology is also common amongst them. It’s typically what’s known as a theology of glory, where being a Christian means life will generally be happy and carefree. But a proper “theology of the cross” doesn’t sell many ads. Sounds a lot like the Prosperity Gospel when you describe it that way. Scary. Smile cause you just got away with something? Is this how we should view grace? Smile because you got away with it? I had to look it up because I thought I had to be wrong about what I was hearing, but sure enough that’s what they’re saying. Because, you know, Jesus had a nice, easy life and died peacefully. Also all of the apostles never suffered any kind of mistreatment, were never ostracized and all of them died rich, happy old men! /s This is why the Antinomian "cheap grace" peddled so much in modern American Evangelicalism bothers me so much.
