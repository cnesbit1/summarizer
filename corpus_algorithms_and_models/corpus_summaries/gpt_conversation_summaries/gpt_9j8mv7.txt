There are a lot of 70s and early 80s comedy porn films that I would watch again for the laughs.  
I can’t remember a lot of the names offhand, but Hot Rackets is one. Desiree Cousteau was my favorite actress back when I was collecting VHS and DVDs of classic porn. She pretty much always played a ditzy airhead.  
Another film was Sodom and Gomorrah: The Last Seven Days, from 1975. Described as “A weird mix of Biblical history, hardcore sex, space aliens, and just sheer weirdness.” Big budget, lots of outdoor on-location scenes, dozens if not hundreds of extras. Basically, it’s the Ten Commandments of the porn industry, back when they took porn-as-filmmaking seriously.  
There were also a lot of dark movies that had good storylines as well (The Devil in Miss Jones, Behind the Green Door, and others).  
The Ecstacy Girls is another favorite of mine, which features her and Georgina Spelvin (from the devil in miss jones) as well as other legends like Jamie Gillis.  
70s and early 80s porn was off-the-charts goofy (except for the dark, serious films of course).
