We know that the pinnacle of Christianity is not dependent on believers preferred political candidates, but our faith in Jesus and our personal endeavours to be more like Him. I've never met an atheist in real life who cited this as why they don't believe, in terms of issues driving people away there are much bigger ones. Well I think religion was a necessary social tool for pack mentality and teamwork in early human days. As a man of science, cosmopolitanism, and non-faith after highschool, I think it's a force (not the only one) keeping world citizenship a pipedream. It's a bit radical but I advocate for a "new world order" in the sense that all humans have certain rights and it's on all of us to enforce the freedom to practice of those rights. Things like climate change are bigger than one country, it takes the world working together to solve it. I think it's a tool for nationalists and dictators to more easily control countries. More controversial topics like abortion/gay marriage are classically opposed by Christians in the US, and I think the GOP abuses the religious vote on these topics. We have so much peer reviewed repeatable evidence that we emerged out of chaos, and 1 collection to say otherwise. Religion helped us go from animals to people. Reason comes into play when we have scientific evidence saying humans resulted from big bang atoms chaos physics and plenty of time in between.
