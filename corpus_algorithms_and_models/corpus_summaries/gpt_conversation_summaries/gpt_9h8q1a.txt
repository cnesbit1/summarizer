&gt;However, it is not clear how many of those actually held permanent residency status versus a soon-to-expire temporary protected status or even a travel visa.

Sending them back to the US simply isn't an option once they are on Canadian soil. The US will not take them back.

If we're following the law, every one of them. They landed in the US, the UN Conventions on Refugees are clear that they get to attempt an asylum claim in the US else they go back to their nation of origin. They don't get to shop around to find a willing patron... legally anyway.

We don't have to accept refugees who enter illegally, unless they are coming ***directly from a territory where their life or freedom was threatened***.

And the law we have with the US (Safe-third country) means we don't have to accept them at US-Canada border crossings.

Basically, we don't have to accept any refugees coming in from the US, whether at a legal crossing or not. None. That's 25,000 people we didn't have to accept, but our government, for some fucked up reason, decided to.

The solution to the backlog is more people dealing with cases. But you just know the Conservatives would complain about the increase in spending even if it pays for itself in less spent feeding/sheltering people.

There’s no need for a hearing if they’re factually not a refugee. If the individual wants to make a claim that they are benign wrongly persecuted by the US government where they fear for their life then there would be a hearing. The US government would be interested to see what sorts of claims are being made against it.

The fact of the matter is that we cannot dump people in another country if that country does not agree to let them in.

We can only turn people back at legal border crossings because that is all the US agreed to in the Safe Third Country Agreement.
