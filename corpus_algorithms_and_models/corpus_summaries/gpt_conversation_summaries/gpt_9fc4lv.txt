We have scripture’s silence with regards to any wife, which we would expect especially toward the end when he is dying. We also have the Tradition that he died a virgin. 

The KJV is an English translation. Before that people were reading other English translations, Luther’s bible, the vulgate, or other texts. But none of those say Jesus had a wife. The KJV does lack some apocryphal texts the Catholics and Orthodox use. But those are from the Old Testament and wouldn’t bring up a wife for Jesus.

Regardless the gospel is usually dated to 150 CE at the earliest and the latest of the canonical gospels, John, is usually dated as competed around 110 or so at the latest.

The only “gospel” I’m aware of that says Jesus has a wife is the so called “Gospel of Jesus’ Wife” which is a short fragment. It’s been proven a fraud.

Absolutely. This is a common trope in gnostic texts. A figure is singled out among the others to receive hidden knowledge that is then passed down in the text. That’s a dominant motif for Gnosticism: a hidden and esoteric knowledge about reality that can only be passed on through symbol and initiation.  

Cool, but just to clarify so you don't mislead others, the Apocryphal Gospels were written long after the Canonical Gospels so in no ways is this 

You still have to prove companion in this context means wife, also the gnostic gospels came way after the canonical gospels.
