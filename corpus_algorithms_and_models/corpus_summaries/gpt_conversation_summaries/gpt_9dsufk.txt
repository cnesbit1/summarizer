This animal *should* have been **STEAMED** till **white** and drizzled with a light soy sauce. Aka the iconic **WHITE CHICKEN RICE** then served with fragrant oily rice with a small helping chili. 

Drowning the chicken in dark soy sauce is *typical low SES* behavior. ðŸ™„ A crime against humanity has truly occurred. Canâ€™t wait for you all to be arrested by PUB AND THE POLICE. Singapore Supreme Court will most definitely put you away for a long long time, longer than kid rapists and murderers.

If you canâ€™t tell thatâ€™s literally swimming in disgusting black sauce, then we are truly lost. The chicken died for nothing!

Lol white chicken isn't even steamed. Is poached.

It is actually dark sauce. 

Tiger brand premium dark sauce is thick like that. 

There's also cooking caramel which is cheaper and you can blend with cheaper dark sauce to have a similar result.

Itâ€™s not dark soy sauce, itâ€™s actually a secret sauce that this stall provides which is really smooth and runny and really good like itâ€™s prob on all chicken rice but this isnâ€™t those thick soya sauce which tastes like shit. I also donâ€™t understand those who drown it all in that.

He was right that it was dark sauce, but he's wrong about dark sauce in chicken rice being disgusting. 

Actually, looking at the picture, theres no dark sauce in there. So he's wrong. That's just the chicken rice dressing sauce. 

Its light soy sauce with sugar, fish sauce and some people put a hint of oyster sauce.
