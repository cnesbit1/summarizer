I was glad to see he’s conscious enough to try to break his fall after putting his fucking head through a back window. Considering that video where the dude throws a brick at a side window and it flies back at him I can’t imagine how much force this guy’s head must’ve hit that with. Honestly, compact hatchback, non-impact force, hand would've been sore, maybe a little more bloodied, and maybe a broken metacarpal, but a few hundred pounds isn't immediately the worst -- think of all the people that have had their foot rolled over by cars and are just fine. I don't know... that's a full on dent in the door. That was a pretty hard hit. A moderate impact force concentrated in a very small area will easily break the glass. Spread over a bigger area, it takes huge force to break.. I’ve seen sledge hammers bounce off windscreens. Whether or not glass breaks is more a question of the rigidity of the thing hitting it. That's why a brick won't break it while a tiny piece of spark plug ceramic can. Definitely a hard hit, not diminishing the force of it. Modern car body panels are either tin foil or plastic ;) The window was half open, car windows are the strongest in the middle. I think he hit the edge of the window and it busted. A hard hit would cave in the door so much the door skins come away from the body.
