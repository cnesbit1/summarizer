Trudeau should definitely call an election now before Bernier can mobilize.  
Bernier has the grassroots support and political momentum on his side.  
Trudeau wants to battle Scheer. He will beat Scheer, because Scheer doesn't offer what the grassroots wants.  
Trudeau would rather not battle Bernier. He might end up losing a crucial debate at a critical moment.  
I believe this is strategically why Trudeau should call an election now. Put himself in the ring against Scheer, and avoid Bernier for now.  
If he ends up in the ring against Bernier, he very much risks getting socked with a knock out punch.  
I fear however that yours is a fundamentally flawed premise.  
First, I don't believe Bernier expects to be a viable opponent of Trudeau in a general election. Rather, he has put himself in a position whereby, with just another seat or two, or even only his own, he can obtain a better position for himself by negotiating either with Scheer or Trudeau after the next election, depending on the results, playing one off against the other.  
This is a party in crisis, and while Scheer is not yet on death watch, he's only a few board moves away from it.  
Bernier is in no position to present himself as a reasonable alternative to the CP.  
There won't be enough people jumping ship. Bernier attracts more of the younger conservatives and those more interested in the whole anti-PC and anti-immigration angle.
