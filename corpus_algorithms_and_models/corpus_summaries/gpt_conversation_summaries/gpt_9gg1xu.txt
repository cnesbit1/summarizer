I'm so sad  
Sorry, man. At least your team didn't get Gretzky and still not win a cup!  
Nice multi-team burn  
In fact, i'd say he lost it.  
Hey man, at least your ownership didn’t force your GM to call Gretzky at 2am to finish the deal, thus ensuring the great one never played for your team.  
I'm sorry I laughed at your pain.  
At least your team didn't have Mike Keenan who was a complete dick to the point that Gretzky left them because of that  
Ah wait  
This is your daily reminder that Mike Keenan is a shitbag  
Or that he purposely benched Dale Hawerchuk when his ill grandma was watching him for the last time  
Don’t worry, Yzerman picked it up.  
Don't worry, at least you guys got another well-loved player from the Oilers dynasty.  
*Hugs /u/Shadeslayer268.* It'll be OK, bud. It'll be OK.  
FUCK MESSIER.  
We were so close :(  
Brett Hull claims when Dale Hawerchuk was a Blue in like 96 or something, they were playing in Buffalo and his sick grandma was going to watch him for the last time. For some reason he must of pissed off Keenan but he sat him out during that game so she couldn't watch him play  
Brett Hull got so pissed off and exploded at him, at costed him the C
