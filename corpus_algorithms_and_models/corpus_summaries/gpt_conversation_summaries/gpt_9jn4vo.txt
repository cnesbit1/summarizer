Here's why you NEED to use your rear brake every time your bike slows down:

1. Using your rear brake keeps the bike upright. This means whenever you trail the rear brake into a turn, the bike will have a steady force pulling from the back end of the bike that will stabilize the rear. Even a tiny amount of pressure, not enough to slow you down, will give you a much smoother turn in every time.

2. Your rear brake keeps your bike from diving and bouncing forward and back. When you initially grab front brakes, your weight will cause the forks to compress, and in virtually all cases you'll have a slight bounce back after the fork reaches compression because of how springs work. Your rear brake, in combination with your swing arm angle, will keep your swing arm in a limited range of motion as long as the brake is applied.

3. It will smooth out your engine braking, when you're doing so just lightly apply the rear brake, especially in between gears, and the bike will feel much more predictable

4. It will help keep you from lowsiding. In addition to all of the above, if you do happen to start losing your front, the rear tire being braked will serve to straighten out the bike, like a spinning car that suddenly locks the e-brake.

5. Fish tailing the rear as you stop sometimes happens when you hit oil or shitty pavement anyways, so if you can get a good feel for when the rear locks up and how it handles, it will make that situation fun instead of terrifying.

6. Your bike is trying to fall at all times. If you're turning and aren't on the throttle, you need to be on the brakes, to keep the bike from wobbling and picking a side to fall on.
