I told her that I felt like we should be able to talk and discuss things like that rather than get mad and have it turn into an argument. I said I didn't think it would upset her because if she said the equivalent to me ("you don't eat me out often enough") I'd take it as constructive feedback and do it more often, or just tell her I didn't want to instead of getting angry.

I think you should talk to her and express that you dont see sex as transactional and you dont want her to feel pressured into doing anything, but that you cant read her mind about how she feels so you need her to communicate her feelings more clearly. Then start a discussion about what each of you actually enjoys doing.

I think it would be healthier if they tackled it as a shared problem.

I think its a bitt unfair to imply that his gf was doing this on purpose so that she could blow up at him about it. Yes, I believe everyone should learn to be better at communicating their needs, but women are often socialized to give "soft" nos instead of "hard" nos so as to protect other people's feelings.

True, "poor communication" may have been a better term than "miscommunication". I think I'm just more hopeful than most people on this thread that people can work on and improve their communication skills.

As a woman, my advice is to ask her to use her goddamn words or don't expect to get what she wants. I see no reason why anyone in any relationship should be shit-tested or expected to mindread. That's not productive or healthy. "If you can't tell me, then how can I possibly be held responsible for not meeting your needs?" Also, no partner is under any obligation whatsoever to meet any need. *Every*one is allowed to say no to something.
