I cant ejaculate when I have sex with my gf. At first we thought it was a problem with me masturbating, so I quit all together. Went cold turkey for a couple months and to no avail. We thought maybe it was the condoms, I cant seem to find a condom that fits me properly and I may have to go to ordering one online to my fitments. So we tried having sex without a condom several times and still no ejaculation. She cums within 15 minutes but we have gone on for over an hour and I cannot cum, and we usually have to stop at that point because it gets uncomfortable and my gf starts to get self conscious and she thinks shes not doing it right. I need some suggestions. 

I can cum from masturbation, just not during sex. I should note, it takes about 25-30 minutes. For me if I'm not constantly in the moment, or thinking of something sexual, I could go all day without finishing. And sometimes one off thought can ruin what progress has been made. I do enjoy the sex, it feels good, but for some reason it just doesn't make me ejaculate. 

Think about what things turn you on the most, porn can help with this if you just roll through different categories until you hit something that works better than the rest. Then talk with your girl and see if you can somehow implement it into your sex life. Welp, I would keep abstaining from dates with Palmala, and try not to think about it too much while having sex or at all, or it could make the issue even worse. Just try to relax and have fun.
