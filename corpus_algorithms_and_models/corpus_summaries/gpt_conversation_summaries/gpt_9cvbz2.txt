This is exactly why I delete my accounts every 6-12 months. There always comes a point where there's too much identifiable information associated with my account from normal use.  
Nope. Usernames are unique, even after deleting an account.  
It's a small price to pay for improved anonymity.  
There's nothing guaranteeing your anonymity. These are just steps to make it harder.  
The chances of me letting enough identifying information slip in a 6 month period is significantly lower than if I kept my account across 5 years.  
There is nothing associating Account #1 with Accounts #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6, so you're resetting the bar of "how much can I say until someone can patch together my identity" with each reset. The idea is to do the reset *before* someone can patch together your identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  
The main thing is comments by deleted accounts show as authored by \[deleted\] to the general public. Only reddit has the comment archive, and I don't know enough about their backend if they keep track of which comments were by \[deleted\] accounts. That kind of info isn't public, and would require expensive legal action to get to.  
Would regularly deleting posts help?  
Yeah, but that is significantly more work. There's plugins to do it, but I'd rather just delete the account entirely.  
It would be hard for anyone but Reddit to link multiple accounts. It's a risk reduction, even if it's not 100% bulletproof.  
So this is how privacy dies, with Corporate investigations.
