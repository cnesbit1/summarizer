I don't know why when I know a girl, will only be a platonic friend I don't really bother to keep the conversation going, but when it comes to a girl I see as a future SO, I put so much time and effort in engaging them.  
Tbh I don't really give a damn about looks  
fully agree as a girl LOL we only give a damn if we deemed that person as someone we want to keep / spend our time with  
Nope, I do the same thing too (as do lots of people). You'll see the same thing in girls who don't give the time of day to guys they're not interested in.  
So egg say he only put in effort for girls that he feels like being in a relationship with.  
Sorry a bit cannot brain today, hope I'm making sense ðŸ˜‚ it's not a big deal.
