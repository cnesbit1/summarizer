When someone sees a slippery slope between same-sex marriage and beastiality or pedophilia, that's a pretty good indication that they view marriage as a pairing between a man and his sex-object, not a loving bond between two consenting adults of sound mind.

The presumption is that person who says "gay marriage will lead to paedophilia and bestialisty" is insinuating that the person believes marriage is primarily about the sex.

Neither an animal or child can consent. Which suggests that marriage is not about consent if gay marriage is being equated with those acts. That then follows that the woman’s consent in that equation is not important either.

For all we know, Thio could mean that the problem with recognising Same-sex Marriage, and why it is similar to similar to bestiality and paedophilia, is that It Does Not Produce Children.

In 2008, President Nathan announced in Parliament that the heterosexual family, man, woman and children is the basic building block of Singapore – love and procreation.

Similarly, why can’t a male/male who love each other, have the same freedom to love as a man/woman. The reason is that they cannot procreate.

When Thio Su Mien sees a slippery slope between same-sex marriage and beastiality or pedophilia, that's a pretty good indication that they view marriage as a pairing between a man and his baby-making machine, not a loving bond between two consenting adults of sound mind.
