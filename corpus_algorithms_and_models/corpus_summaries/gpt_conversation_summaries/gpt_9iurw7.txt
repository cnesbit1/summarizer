I welcome Trump to try to push a NAFTA deal without Canada through Congress.

Trump most definitely would try, but that'll essentially secure that the upcoming election he won't win.

The reality is: he won off his promises that he would turn American "back into" a political superpower (Laughable considering they have, and continue to be so) - crippling numerous states would be a step backwards.

American here. Sorry to say down here trade war with Canada does not make many headlines.

Are you from one of the many states that rely on NAFTA?

Exactly this. Too many in congress rely on votes from people whose livelihood depends on trade with Canada.

I don't think the average person cares until it makes a difference in their lives, sad as that is.

The problem is we don't yet know what is in the deal between the US and Mexico.

The idea that congress won't accept the US-Mexico deal is a huge gamble, doubly so since the contents haven't been made public yet.

Northern Democrats won't hurt their districts

No matter how lucrative a trade deal with Mexico could be, the northern States would be hurt the most.

The auto sector has as much investment in Canada, in Ontario in particular, as it does in Mexico.

That's already happening because as we move closer towards all electric vehicles, ICE's are going to eventually start being phased out.

The USA *will* cut off their nose to spite their face. Anyone who doesn't believe so hasn't been paying attention.

Trump is going to tank the US economy by waging trade wars on multiple fronts

Sure it is. We just have to stop being nice about it.
