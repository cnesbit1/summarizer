I'm always the dominant person and I don't have any problems with that. We've talked very open about it and she knows it's not her fault, it's me being afraid of failing or just insecurity about keeping it hard, I have a very hard time giving in to my sexual drive if I'm not dominant... Appearently this is some sort of performance anxiety You can still orgasm if you're not completely erect. Let her finish you off even if it's on the limp side. It happens. Btw an orgasm when you're not fully hard feels amazing Or you take control and finish yourself while you kiss and snuggle her Maybe me finishing myself is something I could try, but I kinda don't want to tbh... Thanks for the advice tho The biggest thing is to remain intimate with her while you're having happy time Just relax and enjoy. She'll feel much better and so will you It's really hard to, I tried so hard to do it but the thought of "don't fail this time" is killing me... What do you guys focus on if these thoughts come to mind... Personally I just try and focus on the fact that I have a beautiful woman playing with my junk and how much I enjoy a beautiful woman playing with my junk.  It works wonders. Just stop focusing on negative things and think about how hot she is and why you wanted to see her naked the first time you met... I'll try focusing less on myself next time... Thanks dude... She definitely is a beautiful woman :')
