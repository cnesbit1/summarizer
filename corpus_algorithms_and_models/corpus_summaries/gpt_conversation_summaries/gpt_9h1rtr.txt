We've been married for 15 years and if you accept the definition of a sexless marriage as 10 times or less per year then we've had a sexless marriage for a decade. The last time we were physically intimate was March. It bothers me. And upsets me. A lot. She could sleep with any fucking rando but me, her husband, nope. Nothing. Fuck. I married her because I love her and wanted to spend my life with her and I still do. It helped me come to terms with what was happening in my marriage and how it would probably never change. Your story is more common than people think. Its sad. Everyone is attracted to someone initially for a reason. When people first meet and have that attraction they don't know of their detailed past. You're gonna get downvoted on this sub but it's the truth. Numbers should not determine someone's worth but the amount of partners can definitely affect the relationship Yes, it doesn't determine their worth, but it does show their intimacy patterns. I wouldn't want to be with anyone with a very high number. What does that say about their ability to commit to a person? There's a reason people get to high numbers of sexual partners and it isn't just for the heck of it. Basically it's about habits. A person's habits make up who they are. None of these habits are wrong in any way, however, they do alter one's life. Habits of one night stands and a plentiful amount of sexual partners doesn't help in having a HAPPY long term relationship.
