Being a Christian with liberal views often feels like navigating two opposing personalities that cannot coexist. I fear I'll be judged, and treated as uworthy, when I know I'm worthy of God's love. My liberal friends know I'm a Christian and they're cool about it, but I don't feel entirely comfortable talking about my spirituality with them. I've grown to believe that progressive policies are much more humane than conservative policies. I apply this to my political ideologies, it's not my place to judge homeless people, drug addicts, the LGBTQ community, people on welfare, women who need abortions, etc. I could never side with a party that cuts welfare, shames women for having abortions, separates families, incarcerates children, claims All Lives Matter, but then lets people of color live as second class citizens while allowing authorities to kill them, doesn't support healthcare for everyone even though people are dying and we have the medical resources to save them, etc. I'm not here to argue my political opinions, I've just felt so lonely and alienated from my church community and wanted to know if there's people out there who share my experience. Not easy. It's even more difficult that I'm bisexual and the pastor believes that homosexuality is a choice, and has preached that liberal churches don't teach from the Bible. I don't even know why I still go there. I pray that you find the right church for you, where you feel that you belong.
