Yeah my life was shit for the three first years of high school. Some days I just wanted to end it. Seriously fuck bullying.  
I think we do a lot of things well, and there is a difference between us and the States, but we're not without things like bullying.  
Its been 10 years now but Im doing good on and off have other issues to deal like my dopamine reward system which im working on (drugs, junk food, video games) but overall im doing good.  
I just moved to Thunder Bay and can confirm not so polite and not so nice in many parts of the country.  
Bro, have you *seen* Degrassi?  
Didnâ€™t know that show was Canadian until now. Should have put it together when Drake got famous.
