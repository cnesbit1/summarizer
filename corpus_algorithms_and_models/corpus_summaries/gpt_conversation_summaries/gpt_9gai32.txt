Driving without a license is an arrestable offense, but left to officer discretion. It also puts people in danger as you think you know the rules but clearly do not, especially since the test is "so hard". If you are driving without insurance, you may as well be working at McDonalds. If you were to get in an accident, you could end up facing criminal charges and civil lawsuits that would take most of your post-college earnings for years. And it doesn't make any difference how safe you THINK you drive. Another driver could do something stupid, but because you don't have a license, you get ticketed and arrested and the civil suit against you would be a cake walk for any decent attorney since you don't have a license. If you don't have a license, you don't have car insurance. Read the fine print. The point is that just like drunk driving, being unlicensed makes everything your fault regardless of that the other driver did. Unless you are a covered driver of that vehicle which you cannot be if you don't have a license that insurance is not going to cover it and does not matter if someone else is paying for it. There is a reason they tell you that you are required to have headlights in certain situations in the driver's manual.
