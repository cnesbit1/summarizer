It certainly looks like an airplane and a helicopter to me. I happen to think it's something built by humans before the flood wiped out an advanced civilization, but that technology may have been given to them by the Anunnaki.

It's a fact there are conspiracy theorists who come up with theories based on imagination whilst disregarding facts and credibility, then pawn off these musings as truth. It runs rampant here, and I think it's irresponsible and a disservice to disseminate misinformation as if it's truth.

I'm here to discuss the facts so we can ascertain the most probable conclusion. Using our imaginations and running wild with it only makes us stray from the shores of sanity and into the ocean of fantasy.

Finding the truth has nothing to with imagination and has everything to do with evidenced facts. I'm simply pointing this out. Nothing more.

Good point. If they're opinions, they're not facts. It really isn't all that hard following the facts. It's just that people tend to follow their biases instead bc they're more comfortable with the world view they've constructed for themselves and facts can be inconvenient when it challenges their biased view.

I find that NPR is the most credible, reliable, and factual news source. They have this reputation bc they're largely funded by people like you and I. Instead of being a corporate, for profit entity playing off the biases of people in the form of "info-tainment".
