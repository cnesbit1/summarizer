Blaming your perceived bad care on the entire country is unfair. Your issue should be with how your particular Province delivers your healthcare. 

I realize losing a loved one is an emotionally painful experience. I just think that directing your anger in a more productive direction might be beneficial for you.

My question was sincere...when are people going to realize that the experiences in one Province do not necessarily translate to the entire country...and taking shots at the entire healthcare system, nation wide, does no one any good.

Unfortunately people don't seem interested in getting involved to improve the system...or even learn about it...until they find themselves in the position of needing it. It is shortsighted.

But you continue to take these things personally if it makes you feel better about being so angry.

But when addressing someone you'd like to pass some knowledge on to, don't begin it with "Do people still not realize xxxx". You should say Hey man, did you know that provinces run healthcare?

Watch your words. How you phrase things. Whatever you want to say about me, just take a second to look at that and say hey maybe I could have said that better and maybe that's something to watch for because the way I use my words may not match my meaning

You want "harsh" jr? Grow the f up and start taking some responsibility for your actions and feelings.
