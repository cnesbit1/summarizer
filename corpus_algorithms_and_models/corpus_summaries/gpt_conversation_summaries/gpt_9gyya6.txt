I witnessed the change in my dad when he started believing. If God wants you in the faith you will get your cue somehow. As Paul says, "If today you hear God's voice, harden not your heart." "The gate is narrow that leads to eternal life, and few find it." God wants EVERYONE. Even if you don’t want him he will always be wanting you. God desires intimacy with all his children. And anyone can be his child. "What do you think? If any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying?” God seeks those who are lost. Yet also, "No one can come to me unless the Father first draws him." 1 Peter 2:8 8Beloved, do not let this one thing escape your notice: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day. 9The Lord is not slow to fulfill His promise as some understand slowness, but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.
