I thought the fuel pump was bad (and it was) so I had it rebuilt. The pump seems to be working fine now and I installed it in the bike, expecting it to be a simple fix that would cure everything. The battery is at 100%, I went over all of the electrical systems on the bike with a multimeter and checked the fuses (all is well), and replaced the oil and oil filter. Water my have damaged your injectors. U could start by pulling the spark plugs and crank it over. Don't smoke while u do it. There should be a mist of gas in the air that comes out the spark plug hole. Did u change the gas and flush the fuel lines out during your pump rebuild? Yeah definitely changed out the gas... but I didnâ€™t flush the fuel lines. The gas done went bad in your fuel lines. No longer flammable. Flush them out with fresh gas and hopefully it'll dissolve what's left in the injectors. U can tell easy enough by the smell of what gas comes out at the cylinder. Bad gas smells kinda like kerosene. If the lines plugged or injectors not firing the old gas has no way to get out by itself.
