None of those things are legal in Ontario.  
You can ask for first/last month's rent.  Nothing wrong with that.  
Sorry, not with the application, but with the actual contract.  
I did have to provide a bank draft for first and last month's rent when I signed the contract for my apartment.  
First and last with the lease is normal, asking for it with the application is a really scummy thing landlords do.  
A bank draft/money order.  
A certified cheque just is the bank signing off saying you have the money in your account at that time.  They've kind of stopped that practice.  
A bank draft/money order is what is used and on a fancy slip.  They actually pull the money out of your account for those.  
You have to pay for certified cheques, and taking them with an application prevents you from applying elsewhere.
