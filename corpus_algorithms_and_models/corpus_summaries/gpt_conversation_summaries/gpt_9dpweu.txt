If they keep it to 1-2 outdoor games, I can see the appeal of the outdoor games, but have more than 2 then you diluting the special meaning that the Outdoor game provides. Limit it to 1 or 2 a year, and rotate all teams through, with no repeats until all teams get one game. Yeah, part of what makes it a diluting factor is that you get the same teams in the outdoor games that thereâ€™s no variance of other teams in there. You want to give more teams a chance at the outdoor games, stop picking the same damn teams every year. I liked the stadium series at Yankee stadium, but that is mostly because it has a unique situation- 3 teams right there. If they wanted to pull that out again, I don't think any of the NYC/NJ fans would complain, but it couldnt be a yearly thing. Yeah, many people are getting sick of seeing the Blackhawks for the Outdoor game.
