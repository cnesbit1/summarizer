We've communicated about it but we're not sure what to do. I don't want to lose the friendship part though.. what should we/I do? * not living together * not seeing each other every day * having independent lives with hobbies, interests and friendships that the other person is not a part of * having interesting experineces outside the relationship (so that you have something to talk about) * keeping boring domestic routine to minimum and focusing on having fun together * not sacrificing novelty, excitement and passion for familiarity, convenience and safety Not living together...? It facilitates all of the other suggestions Yup. Spending less time together makes the time spent together feel better, and you are not subjected to lot of the tedium of managing a household together. Avoiding hedonic adaptation and unpleasant interactions are very good for a relationship. There's nothing drastic about not moving in together. In fact, it's incredibly common among the 40+ crowd who have full and independent lives and maybe kids from a previous relationship. It's almost the norm when people are not looking to start a family but want someone purely for love, sex and good company. In many ways, being together but living apart is the ideal arrangement. Having own hobbies, doing your own thing, time apart is all good things. Makes you miss each other. But living together is nice. It's important to miss each other sometimes, but also living together is natural after a certain point in a relationship I think!
