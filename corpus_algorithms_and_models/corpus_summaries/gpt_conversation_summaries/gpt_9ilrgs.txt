But you’d have to be an idiot to say that because the alternative to a pipeline is trains and trucks. No matter what, increasing the investment into the oil sector will result in more pollution. Alberta was both using a carbon tax (to promote green infrastructure and fight climate change locally) and working towards selling our oil products. It’s not like if we stopped selling oil, the worlds consumption of oil would go down. They would just get it from somewhere else - and likely from a place with worse human rights records and less regulations on protecting the environment. The oil sands are a massive part of the Alberta economy. Canada has a resource based economy, so if we stop selling a resource then the economy tanks. Pretty easy to figure out for most people. Ending fossil fuel production and consumption must be done one step at a time, if nobody does anything with that lame excuse two things are going to happen. The pollution caused by fossil fuels will increase and the production of those nations with worse human rights will increase regardless of our production. Selling EV’s, and installing wind and solar capacity so people don’t demand as much oil. Cutting supply of oil like you suggest will increase the price, making it more worthwhile to do more drilling in more energy intensive/high polluting areas making the problem worse. Canadian oil is almost without a doubt the cleanest oil you can get. You think Venezuela or the Middle East gives a shit about human rights and environmental care?
