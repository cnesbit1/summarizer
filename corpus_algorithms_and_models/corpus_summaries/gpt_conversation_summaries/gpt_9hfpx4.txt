I find it disconcerting that all except your comment (so far) thought the undergraduate was too sensitive. We live in Singapore so we probably weren't affected by 9/11 much. Just because we did not experience a traumatic historic(al) event and thus not have any feelings to it doesn't mean we should make jokes about. If something on the internet offends you, just close the tab. The solution should never be to prevent someone else from expressing themselves, barring extreme exceptions like hate speech. If highly impressionable people see such 'jokes' online, they may think that it is alright to engage in such behaviour. Terrorism leads to unrest, injury and death too. Just because it is a meme? What if it's a racist meme, then we shouldn't censor it? A meme is simply a form of transference of ideas. I think we can agree that terrorism is ‘more dangerous’ than racism. Racism may not warrant a police report, but that does not mean terrorism does not warrant a police report. I think the conclusion on whether reporting was justified is pretty clear. You need to understand that is a meme. Think of it like a online comedian that is making racist and sexist jokes. I agree that discernment is key. But once again, not everyone has enough information to discern properly. You need to understand that not everyone **and absolutely everyone** has the same knowledge, education, information, and morals that we do. I agree that ideas are a double-edged sword. Welcome to the internet.
