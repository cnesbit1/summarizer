Recently my boyfriend found out sex occasionally hurts me. I didn't tell him earlier because it's normal for me (happened with my previous partner too) and I didn't think the pain was worth making him stop. He said he doesn't want to hurt me and asked me to tell him if it hurts in the future.

Since our conversation I've experienced pain (beyond just being kind of sore) five times and each time I let him know. He stopped every time but seemed a little upset about it. I'm concerned this is ruining sex for him.

Experiencing pain during sex that you didn’t seek out (I.e. spanking, etc.) is not okay, you are not a tool or an object just to be used for someone else’s pleasure. It doesn’t matter if he is frustrated or upset, you have the *right* to pain free sex. If he can’t respect that then he doesn’t get sex. You don’t owe him anything. This is your body!!

What really needs to happen is more communication. If things are hurting you need to stop and reevaluate, find something that you can both enjoy that doesn’t cause pain.

I think it sounds like he does care. She wrote he stops and respects her enough to discontinue and find out if she’s okay, right? Okay, yeah, He seems disappointed... that seems pretty okay to me if he cares more about how she feels.

We want you to like it too. It's hard to feel good about it if you're uncomfortable.

I make sure to mention it when it's seriously impacting my enjoyment though. There are plenty of other sexy things we can do that probably don't hurt, and maybe we can try again later with some tweaks.

Most men are just like you and me, genuinely interested in making sure our partners have the very best time when having sex.
