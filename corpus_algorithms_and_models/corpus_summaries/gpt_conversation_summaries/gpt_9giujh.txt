Even though I have very little in common with Bernier's political values, he is representing some very distinct viewpoints that are perfectly valid and, previously hadn't been meaningfully represented on the political stage. Having prominent, distinct choices is an important part of democracy, and keeps us from falling into the deeply entrenched "douche or turd sandwich" two-party philosophy we see from our neighbours down south. If Bernier's spinning a yarn, at least it's a believable one.

We'll have to wait and see if Bernier is really selling what he's pitching, but if he's being genuine, it's a *good thing* for Canadian politics because it encourages growth and divergence rather than stagnation.

The other edge of the sword would be if Bernier's party is a resounding failure in the next election, or he is proven to be a con. This would likely cause politicians or voters, respectively, to further rally around "the big 3" and continue to be wary of divergent parties.

It is a good thing to see a party with a more back to basics, classical approach to policy. Even if I don't vote for them, I'm glad he's there to express that viewpoint instead of being smothered under the "big tent" of a larger party.
