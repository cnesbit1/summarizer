In 2012 they were able to take a human ovary and discover stem cells capable of producing NEW eggs in human females. In 2017 they proved that not only eggs are lost but they are also partially repleted by stem cells breaking all original thought that we are born with the same number of eggs and we loose them until menopause. This gives rise to the possibilities that they can take a biopsy of an ovary, remove the stem cells and grow brand new eggs at any age as they have proved that even women in menapause have these stem cells, they are just inactive. Therefore this could revolutionize how and what IVF and infertility are known as today as well as how long we think our window of fertility lasts. It’s not about over population as much as helping those who can’t have children due to cancer, ovarian failure, those currently needing IVF and going through really horrible emotional and physical side effects of IVF - the need is already there. Replacing the population is actually incredibly important demographically and economically. The infinite growth model is not sustainable really. The population should decrease and economy adjust in a better system. There will be no "people who enter those fields" if people now do not reproduce and replace the current population. Replacing the existing population is not infinite growth and it is necessary for our society to continue functioning. If people stopped having kids, that would be disastrous.
