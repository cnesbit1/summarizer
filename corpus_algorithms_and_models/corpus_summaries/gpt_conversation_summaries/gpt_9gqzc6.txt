Full immersion water baptism is the point where a person becomes a Christian (comes in contact with the blood of Christ), and receives the gift of salvation. I want everyone to know the truth and I hold this position as being the truth and very biblically sound doctrine. To be saved, the only thing required from you is your desire for God. God 100% saves us, by His grace (Eph 2:8-9). A Biblical understanding of salvation is works *and* faith. Baptism is something God does to us. Repentance is crucial, but not sufficient alone, must be accompanied by other things. James 2:21-26, "21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? 22 You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; 23 and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. 24 You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. 25 In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? 26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead." Yes the bible teaches faith will produce works. Baptism is a reaction to belief and repentance. Acts 2:38, 1 Peter 3:21 says that we are saved when we enter the waters of baptism.
