Honestly, I can't wait.  
Because of my salvation from Jesus Christ. I get to meet my father and leave the devils domain.. What more could I ask for? Nothing.  
Haha, thank you. That's an excellent reason to look forward to dying. That's why Paul looked forward to dying in Philippians 1.  
But honestly yes, I'm so excited. I'm even looking forward for my parents passing. And it sounds crazy saying it aloud, but I always secretly think it's a good thing for them. I can't wait til they get to experience that wonderful peace with our lord. They deserve it. I love them.  
We don't :)  
I'm not here to debate. Have a nice night, it's like 3am at my zone.  
Good night!
