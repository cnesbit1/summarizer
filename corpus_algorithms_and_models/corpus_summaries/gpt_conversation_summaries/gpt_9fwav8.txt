so i told my parents about my gf. but i didnt really tell them that she's my gf but instead told them that ive been seeing her for awhile now. showed my mom a photo of her and she straight up went "huh she's so ugly" and went on about how i should take this lightly and meet more girls to widen up my choices.

also told me that she planning to make me meet her friend's daughter who she deem is prettier. I feel so offended but whatever. smh.

hmm if this is your first relationship I think parents tend not to take you so seriously the first time you tell her about it. the very first time I told my parents I was dating someone, they were adamant on emphasizing (like your mum) that it’s ok to date but I should keep an open mind for more options later. as in telling me to date lightly as well. but they didn’t say those things anymore when they realized my relationship became serious! I think your mum just needs some time to adjust? Asian parents are always unintentionally offensive and hurtful with their weird mindsets lol

nah m8. we're tgt for almost 5months now

well i really do hope so. i probs wont mention anything abt it anymore unless she asks next time
