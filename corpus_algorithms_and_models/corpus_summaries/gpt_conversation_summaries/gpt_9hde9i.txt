I hope there will be some good support for him. Big Tech is the Deep State. They’ve now been making their move on other voices. Hopefully he’ll get some major support. He is hated by the Trump base more than the leftist he is meant to trigger. I am in the sea of red- they believe he is controlled opposition. They believe he is being censored because he had lost influence over them and this gives cause for potential rallying around him- No rally as of yet beyond talk of IBOR or other solutions to social media problems. Alex has been dogged for years about being a potential Mossad asset within the conspiracy community. These rumors have now entered the Trump base. Truth will come out- Mossad rumors are once again swirling in his space. And regarding Alex Jones, I think the Mossad rumors themselves are the actual psyop.
