Believe me, I get that porn is not an accurate reflection of reality. But it seems like literally every scene incorporates this. It’s not even part of a sub-genre. That’s why I ask.  
I think you'll see a trend of mainstream porn getting more and more extreme in these kinds of cases as what was once considered risque becomes tame.  
Porn may be a poor reflection of what actual sex is now, but it’s sadly a good indication of what sex will be.  
You might be right this one time. But history is not on your side... Consider that 30 years ago BJ’s and anal play were rare outside of porn. Now, they’re part of most couples sex life. Choking and 3somes were almost a Porn only thing 15 years ago, now they’re far more common.  
For better or worse, arguably for worse, kids learn how to have sex mostly from porn... Dudes learn what to do and girls learn what to expect and accept. And it’s worse in an age of easy access to hardcore porn.  
I'm not saying that there's isn't people who do it but I've met more people who won't than will outside of the kink scene.  
Perhaps you have very mentally healthy friends with good boundaries. :)  
Mentally healthy? Nooooooo, neither me nor my friends can claim that but we all do have lots of talks around boundaries, consent and ethics so that would be a fair point to distinguish.
