Too hot. I'm stuck in my underwear in front of a fan sweatin buckets in my appartment with no ac. Where do I move in Canada where it's always fall???  
Perpetual fall.  
Vancouver Island üëç That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm going at least, after the BFE (Big Fucking Earthquake)  
A) so I don‚Äôt die  
B) lower property value, as grim as it is to say  
Well idk what you consider "Northern Ontario" but I can tell you as a real northerner it hasnt been over 20 in weeks with lows of almost 0  
I'm voting for eternal winter but with infrastructure and jobs.  
and the mosquitoes in the south (at least were i am) went from 0 to 2000 in like a week. i'm so itchy. :( there was practically none all summer.  
100 fahrenheit IS 38 celsius. You're not trading anything.  
" Of major Canadian cities, St. John's is the foggiest (124 days), windiest (24.3 km/h (15.1 mph) average speed), and cloudiest (1,497 hours of sunshine). Precipitation is frequent and often heavy, falling year round. "  
" The city is also one of the areas of the country most prone to tropical cyclone activity, as it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, where tropical storms (and sometimes hurricanes) travel from the United States. The city is one of the rainiest in Canada outside of coastal British Columbia. "  
We‚Äôve gotta science our way to perpetual fall. On the real.  
Around 25C and 50% humidity. Just warm enough to be in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. Would be perfect all year round.
