I bought a 2016 fz07 with 3300 miles a couple weeks ago. It's now due for the 4000 mile maintenance. I have a tough time justifying the $350-$400 price tag to get this done when it's not much more than an oil change and tightening the bolts. However, it would be nice to have a pro mechanic go over things I may have missed when I bought it. Thoughts? 

Another way to save cash is using a generic motorcycle shop, not an official Yamaha dealership/maintenance shop. 

One that doesn't sell just a single type of bike and won't have a motorcycle brand in the name of the shop and isn't plastered with branding for a certain brand. 

If it’s just an oil change you’re due for (which at 4K miles that should be about it) then it shouldn’t run you more than 50 bucks and a half hour. 

A good shop of this kind will know the kind of work that is expected at that interval and will perform it properly and professionally, especially if it's a common bike. 

By law, it would not void it. But to cover yourself in a warranty situation, you may need to prove the service took place at the appropriate time. 

So get the maintenance done professionally until at least the warranty is up, then after handle it however you like.
