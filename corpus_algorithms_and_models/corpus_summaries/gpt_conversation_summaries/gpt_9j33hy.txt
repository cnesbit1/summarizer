My cousin started his ride home from work a couple days ago and only made it about 400 feet before his bike broke down. Turns out someone had walked by and cut his fuel lines during the day while he was parked on the street. The spot where he broke down just happened to be within reach of the tower crane we have on our construction project so we rigged it up with two round slings to load into his truck. Why would anyone do that? What a dick move. Edit: Talkin' bout the guy who cut the fuel lines. Some people are just really, really shitty. Maybe they grew up in an awful environment and failed to learn how to act decently. It's hard to condemn someone without having lived their life. But also, fuck that guy I don't get it man. You'd think that people who have been hurt would be more against hurting others because they know what it's like.
