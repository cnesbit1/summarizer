I went grocery shopping today like a normal Sunday morning and when I went to load up my car I heard these loud popping sounds and I am a gun owner and go to shooting ranges every so often to practice with my husband so I recognize the sound and it was very distinct. It’s a Sunday so it’s very packed and the parking lot had about 10-12 people in my aisle walking and they quickly turned around with some people fast walking at first and then running quickly. I called my husband frantically but he’s working overtime today with loud machinery. I tried to remain calm as I drove less than a mile home and could still hear the gunshots. I turned on my police scanner (it’s an app on my phone) and about 20 minutes later they reported that a few males were doing target practice directly in back of the grocery store!! What the hell!! Why would you put people in terror by doing that!! They were shooting right in back of the building it sounded like the shots were coming from the inside of the store or the parking lot so we all ran away in fear. I hope no one got hurt when they ran away there was quite a few elderly individuals. I was terrified. My husband called me when I was in the room and said he was proud of me and said “you did everything right” but I feel so silly! I’m glad it was nothing and no one got hurt but I’m so angry that those people feel like they can shoot so close to a grocery store and I am a gun owner they should know better!
