During the army days, some people have done that for tabletop exercise.  
each page are printed double side, so you need two books.  
Street Directory actually sell the whole map of singapore, its very detail, you can even see the road name and every hdb blk number. But its very expensive, a small poster map 1m x 0.6m cost S$450. Buying one book wont complete the map as every page has two zoomed maps, so you need two.  
did before for my army unit. its a little frustrating cos the edges do not 100% match up.  
Go to any transport unit and you'd already see a map on the wall.  
They had different scales for different pages, iirc. There were probably 2-3 different scales? At least for the later versions (2003+).  
I have thought of doing this for many years. It's not technically difficult; it's just the whole board will have a length of around 4 metres. The boards can be bought at Art Friend.  
After the whole thing was done, we photocopied out the affected pages and taped them together, forming a map, but of the routes. I then used string to map out the routes on the jigsaw map..  
Can confirm, my transport unit had a whole wall taken up by the map in the Ops room.
