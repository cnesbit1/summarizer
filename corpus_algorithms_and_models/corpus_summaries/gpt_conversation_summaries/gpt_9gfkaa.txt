I live in PA meaning it is pretty much impossible to ride during the winter, so I was wondering if i should take the MSF course before it gets super cold, or wait until the spring.  
I took mine in the summer (southwest PA) and it was so annoying because you aren't moving much and just sweat constantly.  
I normally store the bike after the first throw of salt but have been known to take a quick ride during the winter months.  
Hell a couple years ago when I still had my ninja 250 I remember riding on Christmas day as it was about 60Â°.  
I think it was back in 2016.  
Took mine mid-May in MD and it was brutal.  
It was only like 80-ish degrees, but sitting in the middle of a parking lot on top of a 200 degree oven makes it feel waaaay hotter.  
Then the heat leads to fatigue and fatigue makes the simple stuff way harder.
