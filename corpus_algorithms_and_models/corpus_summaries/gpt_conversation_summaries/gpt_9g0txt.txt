I am not conservative by any means, and I am not a Christian or religious in any way, but I think society has gone way too far with permissive behaviour. We now live in a time where society says that anybody should be allowed to behave however they want and nobody is allowed to criticise them, even when their behaviour is adversely impacting other people. My parents are shit too. They both have serious genetic illnesses, but wanted kids. Adopt a child? No way, Jose! I want my own biological child and who cares that I'm bringing someone into the world who will have a lifetime of pain and suffering! There have even been people on this sub in the past defending things like adultery and breaking up other people's marriages. Well, I say there should be MORE shaming for purposely shitty, selfish behaviour. Did YOU read? she said the man clearly didn't want a long-term relationship with the mother and the mother didn't care and got pregnant anyway. I think there is a difference between having kids with a potential genetic condition though. There is probably a lot of personal hurt and pain behind your comment, and I don't want to sound insensitive. But the comment has a quasi-eugenics tone. I don't think you meant it that way though. I have OCD. My mom, both sisters, nephew, several aunts, and grandpa all have/had clinical depression. My uncle has Schizophrenia. It is very likely that my children will have some sort of psychological condition during their lives. Does that make me unfit to reproduce? My boyfriend's family seems to think so. They have talked to him about why he should marry me because "what about the grandkids?", and "we don't like 'those' people". It is extremely humilitating and isolating to be spoken about that way. I have cried about the rejection on many occasions. There is tons of evidence that cancer has genetic factors involved. Do I eventually want to watch my child die young because they developed cancer? No. But am I so heartless that I will act like the tragedy of his mother's death is warrant for me to be some eugenics proponent and say "well your genes aren't good enough for me". Every family faces its own genetic issues. Some people might consider it abusive for me to reproduce if I might have mentally ill children. Some might consider it abusive for him to reproduce if he might have children with cancer. It is a question of what diseases are "too bad" to be placed into the genepool of the next
