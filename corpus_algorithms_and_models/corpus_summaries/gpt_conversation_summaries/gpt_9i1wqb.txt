Sorry but you cant change sexuality. Thats common knowledge.  
Please ignore this advice from this poster. Stay away from those forums. It's dangerous and flat out wrong.  
No they haven't. None of those dangerous methods have ever successfully changed one's orientation. You are absolutely wrong. People who claim they changed are almost always right-wing religious fanatics who are suppressing their feelings to try and convince themselves they changed. They usually end up getting caught in same-sex relationships down the road.  
Well, the largest organization for "Ex-gays" admitted that none of their members ever changed their orientation, and their former Founder is now in a same-sex relationship.  
There is no documented evidence that anyone has changed their orientation.  
There are countless examples of people who have prayed for years and years for God to change them and he never does.  
You cannot change sexual orientation.  
Supposed bias is not an excuse for lack of evidence. You have literally zero data to support the claim that sexual orientation is capable of being changed at will.  
The only gay people I know who have been suicidal have been suicidal while being in conversion therapy environments, or who were raised to believe that being gay *was* a choice. So they blamed themselves and hated themselves for continuing to be gay. If prayer, counseling, fasting, exorcisms, etc didn't work, the fault must be theirs, right?  
I have no words for how blind you seem to most gay folks' reality.  
There are countless Conservative think tanks around the world with endless money who would love to sponsor studies that prove homosexuality can be changed or is not natural or biological and so on.
