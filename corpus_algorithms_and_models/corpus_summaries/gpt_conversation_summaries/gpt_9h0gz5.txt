This may be fake news.
Oh, theres no question that the MSM dissed Bernie while giving Trump an enormous amount of unwarranted airplay.
Yeah the leaked DNC Emails proved the primary was rigged in Hillary's favor, which pissed off Sander's supporters, who in turn voted for Trump.
There were multiple examples of Bernie doing well in primaries and being ignored while Trump was pushed to the front.
People have tracked and studied how much coverage the different candidates received.
The DNC honestly could have just not let him run at all, considering he's not even part of the Democratic party.
The Dems lost the elections more then de GOP won it
For a lot of people, the 2016 election was a rejection of the status quo more than anything, and Clinton was the ultimate representative of the status quo.
The problems with Clinton, and the Democratic party leadership generally, are far more broad than the "spolier" narrative being peddled by corporate-left apologists about Bernie.
The fact that Obama voters behaved in roughly the same way supports this assertion.
The Paul's were running. Johnson was the libertarian candidate.
I donâ€™t know a single Sanders supporter who ended up voting for Trump.
I was a diehard Bernie supporter during the primaries, even volunteered with his campaign in my state as a precinct captain.
Neither of them were my choice but my choice was robbed from me by Clinton and her goons in the DNC.
