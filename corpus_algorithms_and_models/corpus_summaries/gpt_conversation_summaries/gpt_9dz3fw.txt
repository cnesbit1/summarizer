It's funny how we keep being surprised by our own aging. I think it's just more shocking how time gets away from you. I find you don't feel old until you're made to feel old. I mean I'm nearly 25, I'm not close to old but in my head I'm a lot closer to 18 than 30 and in reality it's actually quite the opposite. I don't relate nearly as much to 18 year olds as I think I do. I'm 35 and I still feel closer to 18 than to 30. I don't think you ever feel that far away from 18 lol. Kids born after 9/11 can drive, they can join the military next year. I remember Gionta saying that he remembered winning the Stanley Cup with Jay Pandolfo in Jersey and it was weird being coached by him in Boston. When your former teammates are now coaching you, probably time to hang it up. I’m 29 and I was/am a big fan. I remember hearing Roster when I was like 7. The kid was like "How do you remember shit like that?" as if it happened a long time ago, and it's like, well I was a grown man and watched it happen live, that's how I remember, seemed like it was only a couple years ago. But to the young guy it was basically half a lifetime ago. Shit like that is jarring. I mentioned dial-up yesterday and this kid didn't know what it was. I tipped her $3 and cried in my ice cream. I know, I was quite surprised when I remembered that Lemieux played until 2006. The 9/11 one gets me. I’m 31 and dating a 25 year old and she said she was in second grade when 9/11 happened.
