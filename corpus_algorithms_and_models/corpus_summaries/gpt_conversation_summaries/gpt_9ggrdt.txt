Qanon doesn't need deniers, it's blatantly, ridiculously untrue. What's more, the users were calling for the deaths of people daily. 

I'm not lying, but you are. There were calls for the deaths of Obama, HRC, Podesta and more every single day. The writers weren't removed, they were celebrated and called patriots. 

I was on the sub, I saw people talking about traitors hanging constantly. Anyone can pull the archive and see I'm telling the truth. You're the only one gaslighting here. 

By the way, Q is fake and everyone with common sense knows it. 

Lol they weren't violent, "just execution talk."
