My wife and I have an amazing, strong, independent daughter who just turned 10. The two of them recently went to a one-day class about what to expect and how to deal with things as her body starts to change, and this made me realize that while I’m prepared “academically” I don’t really know how she’s going to change as a person in the next few years. 

And on a much more specific level, I have a little bag in my car with tampons and pads in case she ever needs it, but what else should I keep there? All the “first period kits” seem to just have those things. What about baby wipes? Chocolate? Advil? Or are those just dumb stereotype things that girls don’t really need? I want to add, and I'm not saying you'll do this, but don't make her feel ashamed when she's on her period. When I was a preteen and living with my parents, I wasn't allowed to throw my pads away in any trash can inside the house. This was my dad's rule. He felt that the blood was gross and, therefore, I had to always take my pads outside to the trash. This was embarrassing and totally not convenient because, on heavy flow days, that might mean taking a pad to the bin at 2am. It was also really embarrassing because that meant everyone in the house knew I was on my period. In a way, it felt like a punishment for something I had no control over. 

Yeah for sure that’s not me, but thank you for the advice. I’ll do my best to never make her feel any different when she’s having her period, or to single her out in any way like this.
