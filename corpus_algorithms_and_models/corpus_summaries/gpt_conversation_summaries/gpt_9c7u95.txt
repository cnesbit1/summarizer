Jesus tells us we need to believe in the books Moses wrote.  
Paul tells us he believes all the law and the prophets.  
Peter decries those who take a naturalistic viewpoint of the world, denying creation and the history in the Bible.  
Not to mention the gospels proclaim in Jesus's genealogy that He is descended from Adam.  
You must decide if you trust men that deny Christ or the words of eternal life.  
The Bible was not written by the will of man.  
It was written by God.  
The Bible is totally unaware of the Bible.  
The Word is Jesus, not the Bible.  
The bible only says the truth and I believe it because of the testimony that stands behind it-the testimony of the church and the witness of the Holy Spirit.  
The church has always been comprised of hundreds of individuals who all claimed to witness the same thing.  
These people then passed this testimony down to the next generation of Christians saying, "Hey, we saw people give their lives out of love to give us this message-that they witnessed God in the flesh as Jesus and His power.  
The scriptures this passage is talking about is the law, the prophets, and the new testament scriptures.  
God knows everything. He has always known what the Bible would be.
