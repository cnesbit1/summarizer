Yes.

Also yes.

Any time the Bible uses the word fornication that means sex before marriage.

Because the Bible uses mostly principles instead of laws, you will never find the words "premarital sex is a sin" within the Bible. However, if you use critical thinking skills, there are multiple verses in the Bible that point to this. One such verse is 1 Corinthians 6:9 lists (depending on translation or version, this particular one is King James) "fornicators" as those not inheriting the kingdom of God.

Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines fornication as sex between two unmarried persons [see source here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fornication). Therefore a fornicator is a person who has sex to someone they are not married to.

The Mosaic Law was a law for the Jews. Christians do not follow the Mosaic Law, but the Mosaic Law still provides important insight into God's thoughts.

If the Bible is truly inspired of God, then don't you think He would make sure what He wants is clear? Could it not be that possibly He inspired later translators to use more modern language with same or similar meaning?

The teaching that sex before marriage is wrong has been passed down through the church since the time of Jesus and there is no evidence of there ever being any controversy over this.

I want to a see a biblical text that directly condemns sex before marriage as a sin. Or a lexicon of ancient Hebrew or ancient Greek showing that the words usually translated "fornication" literally refer to pre-marital sex. Or a modern scholar of ancient Hebrew or ancient Greek who can spell it out.

You’ve been given answers. If you need scholarly sources to tell you what words mean and what has been taught without controversy for thousands of years, then ask some academics. There’s even a sub-reddit for it. Or just Google it.
