Hey it's a public post near the top of /all, you're welcome to judge as you see fit. I'm certainly judging and my judgement is that it's incredibly stupid.
Sometimes the fringes find common ground.
The game monopoly was created to mirror the rigged system of the real world. It was designed by the creator to be a satirical game. So for those that know it is based off of reality, can connect the dots.
Yes, the idea that the Federal Reserve Bank can simply write on pieces of paper and create money out of thin air and simply loan it to the United States to be paid back with interest is Rule 11 in this Monopoly game.
It is an unintentional, yet accurate representation of a broken financial system. Broken to some, purposely driven to others.
The United States has an incredibly tumultuous history of its currency and the rules behind it all. At one point, there was a gold standard. Simply put, 1 oz of gold equaled $1, so to have $20 in circulation in the United States meant 20 oz of gold was being held by the United States Treasury.
A secret cabal of bankers and influential robber barons, who some people call the Illuminati, attempted to create the Federal Reserve throughout American history. In fact, read Andrew Jackson’s biography to highlight his battles against a central banking system.
It wasn’t until 1913 the Federal Reserve Bank as it is known today was created. With it, came the idea of fractional reserve banking; a concept which is rooted in the idea of writing numbers on pieces of paper to create a fiat currency.
The conspiracy part comes in here. No government entity controls the Federal Reserve Bank. It is a private institute, it makes a profit, that profit is paid to a certain elite, that elite some call the Illuminati. The Federal Reserve Bank controls the currency of the most powerful country in the world, which makes it the most powerful entity in the world.
I interpreted this post as a tongue in cheek jab at the artificial creation of money through the current fiat system. I recognise many here were likely born after 2008 but there is a general understanding for those who were alive 10 years ago that the current system has flaws.
The post is an approximate metaphor for fractional reserve banking. A process of creating 'value' and therefore debt, (which has to be paid back through real labour) without having to fully back it up with anything tangible. No one's calling it a conspiracy, it's common practice.
Ummm...it's not a
