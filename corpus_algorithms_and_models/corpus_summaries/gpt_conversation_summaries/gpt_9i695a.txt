I have no doubt that you love each other but if this is what engagement is like, do you really want this to be your marriage as well.

Even if he shut you out you need to try and have a serious conversation with him about the direction that your relationship is heading.

Yes I'm sure I do love him, but I'm *very* unsure he loves me, he made a hurtful statemt a while back that he is only with me for this kids, this hurt real bad and I still think about it, he doesn't really show love only insult and then says it's because he loves me and all that.

The conversation part, that *won't* happen. 100% will not. He is not that kind of person, he shuts me out and gets mad that I'm "bothering" him.

What scares me the most is the fact that you said you would not be opposed to marriage if he was a completely different person.

I know that a lot of people here are giving basically the same advice, some of us know from experience others don't want to see you go down that rabbit hole.

I know I over think, and it's probably why I lack sleep!

No person should have to walk on eggshells in their relationship.

The fact that you care enough to even listen to our suggestions means that you know what he does to you continuously is not right.

You said about it being the stupid sex mistake but it's much more than that.

You know what you have to do, you just have to muster up the courage to do it.

And honestly doesn't really matter how he reacts as long as he doesn't hurt you or your kids.
