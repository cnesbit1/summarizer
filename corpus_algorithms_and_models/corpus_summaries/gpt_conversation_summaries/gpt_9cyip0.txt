Meanwhile 10000 children go missing each year.  
Most of them are quickly found though.  
If 10,000 kids were literally dissappearing that would be 27 kids a day. You would hear about an epidemic of missing kids. But you don't because 99% of them are runaways who are found within 48hrs.  
No, I mean if 27 children were disappearing (permanently) from their homes every day it would be a national scandal.  
But its not happening.  
These 2500 arrests are John's using hookers. Yes some of them are 17,16,15 years old but not often are they much younger than that. Of course this is a tragedy, but it is a mistake to associate the erroneously understood stat of missing kids with child prostitutes.  
From your article  
>195 of those arrested were involved with producing child pornography or have sexually abused children. The investigation also identified 383 children who had suffered abuse.  
So the actual numbers of child abuse are significantly smaller than the headline figure you are touting, which is emotive and misleading.  
I also note from your article the volume of arrests is nothing new, in fact most years see MORE arrests (83,000/20 years = 4,150 arrests/y)  
>The Justice Department says the ICAC program, which got its start in 1998, has since resulted in more than 83,000 arrests.  
You're accusing people of operating a sex trafficking ring that rapes and murders children, is it really that big of a deal to ask for evidence?  
pizzagate was never just comet pingpong, it was about a high profile, political pedophilia.
