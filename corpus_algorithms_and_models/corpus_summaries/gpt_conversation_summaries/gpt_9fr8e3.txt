Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behavior and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.” ― Terence McKenna

Have you done them yourself? Because I have personally experienced and witnessed many positive changes in myself and others from experimenting with psychedelics. Especially micro dosing.

The use of psychedelics as a mental and spiritual aid didnt start with mckenna though, it goes back throughout human history.

Exactly. It’s so much bigger than one random point in history a few decades ago

Any read the other posts, these are sacred experiences, and much more effective then sitting in a corner trying to speak in tounges.

Many of us have had lifechanging experiences from tripping, and for you to just attempt to write them off as another one of "the man's" tricks on us is ignorant.

I hope you find what you are looking for ib this life, but shit, i just don't think you understand life, maybe tripping could help you break free from that cage you're in.

Sorry if my words seem harsh, but it is impolite to speak ill of the dead, and btw its not a fake name, his brother and children are still alive.
