As of tomorrow, I am going to be away from home, on an 8 day film shoot across the east coast of NSW. Naturally, I decided to have a nice long relaxing shower before I left. 

About 4 mins into my planned 25min shower, I was midway through shampooing my hair when I felt something. I look up above me, and to my HORROR, a black, eight-legged, piece-of-shit, shower-ruining, house spider dropping down its web towards me via the air vent.

Australian children are taught very young to stay away from spiders. It’s common knowledge that the black ones can cause extreme pain, seizures, death, so I know my daycare teachers would be proud seeing my 6’2, 91kg, naked male body glide through my sliding shower doors and onto the tile floor, covered in shampoo.

They’d be extra proud of me, without thinking, grabbing the toxic insect spray, and proceeding to blast the shower and spider, with a fallout cloud that would rival the scene from T2: Judgement Day. 

They would NOT be proud of me, however, of being so paranoid about seeing the spider die, that I stood in the enclosed, steamy room, inhaling the fumes to see it. It wasn’t until I realised my eyes were watering and I could smell a stinging sensation that I realised I had unintentionally gassed myself. 

So my naked, wet, bloodshot-eyed, dumbass attempted to run out of the bathroom, to escape dying via ALDI cheap bug spray. Attempted, because I then proceeded to trip over where the bathroom tile meets the kitchen tile, and promptly give myself a bloody nose. In the nude.

My nose is ok, the bleeding has stopped. And yes, the spider is dead.
