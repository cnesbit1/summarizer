c sections are only done when medically necessary for the health of the baby or mother.  
You do realize that a C-section is still pretty significant surgery, yes? Even if you were under general anesthetic when they cut you open and stitched you back up, you're still going to have all of the healing time.  
But, it's not like having a c-section is just a no big deal alternative.  
this is a more complicated conversation   
but a c section is in fact invasive surgery AND this post is just odd.  
As the previous commenter said, it’s nnot just the surgery you have to contend with—it’s very worth noting that a c-section also often takes much longer to recover from as well. It’s by no means an easy way out of childbirth—just different. In a lot of cases you just get a local anaesthetic (so you are still awake but don’t really feel anything)  
Not true. Elective C-sections are a thing, and a woman has every right to choose how she wants to give birth. It doesn't impact you.  
elective c sections without indication should not be a thing. c sections cause complications for mother and child and should only be done when there is a likely benefit for one of them.  
There is a SMALL increased risk, which is not enough of a concern to remove the ability for the mother to choose how she gives birth. It is not your business if a woman does not want to give birth vaginally.
