It's just my depression. Its like it's trying to kill me. Don't worry it won't. It's just such an extreme feeling tonight, though. Not looking forward to sitting through this!

Edit: I think it might be because it's my birthday, so the enemy is attacking me bad. Things usually get pretty bad spiritually on birthdays, I think just because it's a bully.

Let me just ask you directly what do you believe and why do you believe it? And how did you come to know it was true?

I prefer not to make assumptions. So o would much rather hear it from you directly. Why will you not do this? Are you afraid of the questions I will ask about it?

Not trying to refute anything, I just have a lot of questions. The big one being why do you believe in this particular god?

I am very interested in what people believe and why. If you know something that is true, I want to know it as well. So I ask questions to discover how you know.

I think every post would be good for that? Aren't believers called to give their evidence for their beliefs? I think that is in Peter some place. I could be wrong.

Again all I am doing is asking questions, why do you seem to take issue with this? And why don't you answer them?

I think there are a lot of other faiths in the world, and I think I have never been given any good reason to believe any of them. Why do you believe that this one being is the only possible one?

Well your right I chose to ignore your question to get back to mine. Your post history made me ask this question. Let me ask again, why will you not answer my questions? Are you afraid of them for some reason?

Wow, ok why do you think I am being anti Christian. And how exactly have I done any of the things you are claiming here? I would think it should be easy to show your evidence in this case, would you mind?

Because you keep not answering them. Why?

I think it is interesting that someone else here just called me anti Christian, for the grand old crime of asking questions.

Never. I love to answer questions. Why don't you?

Whare have I asked the same questions over and over, once they Have been answered?

Also can I just ask, what would change your mind about this belief you have?

I will take you advice on this to heart. Thank you and have a good night.

This devolved into a side-argument, and we
