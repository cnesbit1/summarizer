yes its bother line emotional affair, and it sounds like there are some issues that needs to be addressed. Thus, i suggest to talk to a couple therapist.  
this is why i think that you guys need to go to couple's therapy.  
it sounds like he is unhappy in the marriage, and isn't taking your feelings into account. If you guys don't address the deeper issues, im not sure that your marriage will last long.  
first ask yourself, "do you want to try save the marriage'?  
If you both say yes, then talk to a therapist. A therapist will give you better advice than anyone can give here.  
The first thing to go is therapy because he doesn't WANT to work on his issues, not that it doesn't work. That's like saying physical therapy doesn't work when you never do the exercises they give you  
Well their are 2 things you've pointed out.  You husband holds all the cards, you'd loose everything if your marriage dissolved.  And he has lost faith in therapist ability to help you.  
The steps you've taken to handle your mental illness, are not working.  Your husband sees this, and he's near his breaking point.  Thats what this sound like to me, he's looking for an exit.
