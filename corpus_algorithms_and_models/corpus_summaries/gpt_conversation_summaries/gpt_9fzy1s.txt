You can look completely different than in photos than what you look like in person depending on angles and lighting alone. And honestly nobody realistically expects someone to look *exactly* like their profile photo. Go on the date. You’re fine. :)

Yes! No bullshit, you look similar. Also angles &amp; lighting!!! Go on the date. :)

Yes, I’m a girl. Yes, you look similar. Again, nobody expects you to look exactly like your profile pick. No one I’ve gone on dates with had. I think you’re being too hard on yourself.

No. You look pretty much the same in all of the pics. And as a man in barber school, id recommend finding a style that you can rock the fuck out of. But regardless of that you're fine. It took me a long time to let myself not give a fuck about other people's judgments of me. There are people out there that will think you're attractive and some of those you'll share that interest in them.

Now go make that date happen, bro. If she doesn't find you attractive, someone else will. Don't mope about it. Its not worth the energy.

Im telling you you arent "surprising" her if thats you in the pics. What im telling you is to relax, man. Just go on the date and stop being hard on yourself. I too struggle with confidence. Have for a long time. But i force myself to be confident and it works. Find what works for you style-wise and that will go along ways.

Yes. I can see its the same person in them.

You are a human that deserves respect. If you get disrespected, they can go fuck off. But they also deserve the same respect. Idk if you can or would, but weed helped me alot. Gerting high and "meditating" on my confidence helped my psyche a lot.

Camera angle and lightning **CAN** effect how people look in photos.
