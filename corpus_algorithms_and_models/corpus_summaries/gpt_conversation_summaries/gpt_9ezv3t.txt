People are upset that a man we welcomed into the country, supposedly so he could have a better life, brutally murdered a *thirteen year old girl* who was a citizen of this country.  
no people are upset that you use this one man to blame all refugees  
So you suggest we dismiss the group's plea for tolerance towards other refugees?  
how about you just explain your point then, are all Syrians to blame for this or not? Cause that all this is about  
The article? Yea pretty much  
Your comment was vague and sensationalized enough to leave me wondering if you have more to say about what the article is trying to actually plea for. So I asked the question. No hard feelings, bruh.  
What does this mean **in-context** of the plea proposed by the group in the article? Are these people now going to stigmatize refugees, notably Syrian ones, or not? What is the fall-out of being upset? This is the core issue of this particular article.  
They banned me once for calling America a shithole, but to be honest, I get banned on a regular basis by people who disagree with my opinions.  
No one's blaming all refugees. Are you crying victim yourself is that it?  
How are you getting all syrians, how are you getting all refugees ? You're an instigator.
