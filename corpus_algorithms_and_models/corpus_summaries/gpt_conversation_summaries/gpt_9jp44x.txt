It's not all just revenge porn (still unacceptable), there are lots of people who think it's okay to post nudes that they received from someone off of tinder or snapchat. Not only does it make me both furious and disgusted, it terrifies me. And now, years later, I get this furious broiling in my stomach every time I see some abhorrent, greasy loser online, posting pictures that they received privately, because they have deemed them to now be public domain. Do not breach someone's trust that way. **POSTING NUDE CONTENT OF SOMEONE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IS ILLEGAL, IMMORAL, AND DISGUSTING** And it's also against reddit's rules! Why is this such a difficult concept to understand for fucks sake?? I'm saying there shouldn't BE risks because people should be decent, and I'm allowed to be mad that they're not. So it's my fault because I loved and trusted someone who manipulated me? That's a really shitty way of looking at it. No, you couldn't have known that beforehand, which sucks. He betrayed you in a way that most people wouldn't. I'm not stupid, I know that the only way to protect yourself 100% is to not do it at all. But that doesn't mean that that's right or that I'm not allowed to be angry at that, jfc. There is something fundamentally wrong about spreading nudes like your ex did, and also stealing someone's nudes by hacking their computer. What you're not getting is that I agree that this PSA is a good idea, and that people need to be constantly reminded how not to be shitty people.
