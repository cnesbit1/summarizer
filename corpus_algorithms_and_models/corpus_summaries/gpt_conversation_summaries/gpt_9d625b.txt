I've seen several doctors for mine, drastic difference in outcomes. Real doctors, surgeons and PT's are amazing when they all have the same common goal. Any professional teams doctor is a regular practicing doctor.

My doc would check in on me during PT and hold his staff accountable to my progress. Agreed! My torn ACL happened on workers comp, and I ended up with a professional sports athlete doctor.
