I Didnt know until I tried , on the highway , the max speed of it is 110 and diying already.  
The problem is this bike starts to die around 4/5 gear on 90Â° any ideas?  
Its a new bike with 800km only.  
To answer your question: 110 km/h seems pretty reasonable. My old 250 XT with double the horse power only did 115 km/t. The CBR 125 with full farings does 110 too.  
On my ol' XT I always just found a nice truck and stayed behind that on the highway - less wind and nice 80 km/h without hammering the engine and gas-consumption. Do that.  
Im on a almost 1000km of it.  
I do everyday Around 90km/h to pass the small highway. Im going also to change the rear escape for a racing one.

no.its like every engine have a specific speed limit when its new.i have a honda 125 and it had to be no more then 60km/h for first 1500 km as it effects the engine efficiency and integrity in the long run.basically u have to prepare the engine by going step by step.first 40km/h then 60.mine goes to about 115km/h after proper break in period but at that speed it sounds like someones cutting its throat.  
Nothing really. You can spend 1000 euro and make it go 120-125. Keep the bike as it is and spend some money on good tires, good brakes and gear - that and your skills will make it way fast than any part you can buy.  
"It's more fun to ride a slow bike fast than a fast bike slow" Definitely true!
