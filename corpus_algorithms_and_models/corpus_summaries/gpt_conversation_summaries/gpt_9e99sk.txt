Evolution doesn’t have anything to do with the origins of life. It’s a description of the observed changes of generations due to genetic variations and mutations with natural selection for advantageous traits. 

The evidence for evolution is stronger than many other scientific theories.

But that does not make evidence for evolution weak. Facts are facts, irrespective of if scientists are wrong or not in explaining them.

Yes, but the Bible doesn't state how God created humans, does it? 

Evolution is not the word of man, it's an observed, measured, natural phenomenon. Or do you believe too that gravity is the word of man?

You're confusing phenomena with the theories that that explain them. If no man had ever come up with a theory of gravity, anyway the earth "attracts" us to it. 

The Bible doesn’t say how he created humans.

The earth is billions of years old.

The Bible is silent on the age of the earth.

The Bible doesn’t say HOW God created man.

And God has never been wrong. But God didn’t write the Bible.

Those creation accounts, most likely written during the Babylonian exile, were never meant to be science books nor literal history.

No, If you’re a Christian you follow and believe what Jesus says. He never said anything about following the Bible.

2 Timothy 3:16 does NOT mention the Bible.

2 Timothy 3:16 does NOT say the Bible is the Word of God. 

2 Timothy 3:16 does not limit Scripture to just the Bible.
