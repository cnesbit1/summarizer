You would be fucking shocked to see what people can learn about you just through metadata. Shit like "if you stop by convenience stores every day on the way to your home, you're likely an alcoholic, or smoker...and if you go back again later that night, it's almost certain you're overindulge in alcohol." They can tell who your friends are, what your hobbies are, as well as your friends, your political proclivities, etc.

Big-data is basically like having a genius private eye on you all the time, who also has access to all your friends.

It's not mind reading, it's paying close attention to your daily activities, from the places you go, to the people you talk to, to the information you ingest online.

...that's why we must all fight against the intrustion of data corporations in our lives. Get a fucking VPN, be intentionally vague with your internet history.

They're not trying to help you with the data they gather, at best, they're trying to trick you in to buying shit, at worst, they're selling your profile to alphabet groups to profile you.

Exactly. It's extremely sophisticated technology being used on people who don't know any better.

To add to this. All phones come with front facing cameras as well now. Eye movement and expression can be tracked. Meaning they know what you know, and how you feel about it, and when you pause to consider something, how long it takes you to process. The potential is terrifying.
