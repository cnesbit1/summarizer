Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for.  
Hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered. Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all.  
Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are.  
Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle.  
As always please remember to read the FAQ.  
This thread will be refreshed each Monday.  
For my 2-year riding anniversary, I want to get some really nice adventure riding boots. Recommendations?  
I now wear Alpinestars Roam 2 WP boots. These have been great, but I'd like something with more protection. Specifically, taller.  
I'd like to protect my feet & shins better than the Roam 2 WP can, with both waterproofness and breathability if possible.  
My Cycle Gear stocks some of the Alpinestars Tech series (1, 3, and 7), so let's use those as examples.  
It's not quite true that price is no object, but I can handle $300-$400 for boots if that's what it takes.  
Sidi Adventure 2.  
A lot of people swear by the Forma Adventure boots for on/off road/ADV stuff and while I haven't tried them, they are at the top of my short list of boots to get/try.  
You can argue that any product will have the occasional defect, and yes glued-on soles is not necessarily a bad design.  
It looks like the Adventure 2's go for around $300 overseas, but we get to pay $500 for them in the US. Boo!
