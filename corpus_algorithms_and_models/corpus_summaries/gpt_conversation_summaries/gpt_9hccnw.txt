I'm a math TA at my college, and I was working my weekly shift. I also have a cold, so I had been blowing my nose pretty frequently throughout the shift. I did a Google search, and the first thing I read was "An unruptured aneurysm usually causes no symptoms." Next thing I know I was being helped across the room by another TA in the room, and I had no idea what had happened yet. I start to panic, and when I try to sit up, I immediately started to tunnel-vision again, so I quickly put my head back down to keep from fainting again. EMTs were called, and ambulance was sent to my location. After ten minutes or so I felt fine aside from being a little shaky after everything had happened, and a hospital stretcher was brought in. After everything went down, my understanding is that I fell out of my chair and hit my head on the wheel of a table in the room. Overall though, I was very impressed with how the situation was handled. I'm just glad to say that I wasn't alone when I fainted, otherwise I might not still be here. There's a syndrome or condition or something that like 10% of the population has where listening to or reading about bloody things can make you faint or feel faint and once the process starts it can be difficult to stop. Probably talking about vasovagal syncope.
