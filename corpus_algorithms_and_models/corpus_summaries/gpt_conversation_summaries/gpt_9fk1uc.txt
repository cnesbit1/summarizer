We have been married for almost 4 years. I’m not all that sexually experienced and he’s told me that he likes noises during sex (anything from soft moaning to screaming) because he’s thinks it’s sexy. Then suddenly one day out of the blue he started imitating the noises that I make and repeating things I say in a mocking tone (almost like a bad porno). I didn’t appreciate that and it made me feel embarrassed. I’ve asked him to stop several times right when he says something but he just laughs at me. So now when we’re having sex I don’t do or say anything for fear of what he’s going to say. And he’ll sometimes say he’s joking but it’s not funny. It’s hurtful. Edit: and we are in marriage counseling (for other reasons) but we haven’t talked to our counselor about our sex life. You tried to please him and after a while the way he reacted started to hurt you even though you were trying to please him. For all you know he may be teasing you and unintentionally hurting your feelings. Sex needs to be consensual. Withholding it is her right as a human and it’s the law. Sex should be a way to show your love and should come from a place of respect and enjoyment. Once she looses the power to be able to say no, she is a victim. Sex needs to be consensual, EVERY single time. She has a right to her own body!
