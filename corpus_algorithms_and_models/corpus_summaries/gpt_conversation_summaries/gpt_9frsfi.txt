She took a key from under a rock and I didn't think anything of it, people forget their keys sometimes. I met her at a club. I didn't get her number. Call 911. Trust me they have heard way worse. Cops might even be able to get your wallet back. I don't know if she stole anything. I don't want to get accused of stealing anything, or arrested for being an involuntary burglar. You’re going to get accused of stealing or burglaring if you don’t go downstairs right now and explain what happened and make yourself known. OP you’re gonna end up in a much worse situation if you don’t come clean. Call downstairs and ask for help, and say she lied and tricked you. They know this girl, and she has a history with the family. Worst case, they call the cops and you explain the situation. The longer you hide, the worse this situation looks. You try and sneak out and they catch you, it looks horrible. You just need to be honest. If you're black I totally understand why you don't feel calling the cops is a good idea. Wait for them to cool down a bit and then make your way downstairs explaining who you are and what happened. State that the girl led you back to the house under a false impression. Or take the risk and wait to they go out for the day then leave. But it's better in terms of looking like a burglar to just suck it up and go downstairs and explain yourself.
