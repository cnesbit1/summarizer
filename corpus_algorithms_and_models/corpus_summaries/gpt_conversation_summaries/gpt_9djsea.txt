If you have a passenger, be sure to check their gear, and give them clear instructions for how to ride (and how not to).  
Ugh... Unless the passenger is a fellow rider or a frequent passenger of mine, I just ask them to stay still and solid with the bike frame, that way it's predictable and easy both for me as for them.  
Nothing worse then having them move around at the wrong time, or not being consistent with the leaning.  
I told him to pretend to be a stack of bricks, sitting on top of my seat.  
I stopped letting people ride with me simply because I hated the way it felt riding.  
I've almost not made a corner a few times due to it.  
I've explained it 100 times, but she still does it every now and then.  
IMO, you are taking corners too fast if you have to hang when you are with a passenger.  
Easiest way I found to force people into following my moves was to tell them to grab onto me like a "hug" instead of having free hands or holding onto the rails.
