Engine looks completely different. CB500/550 has those distinctive end caps, whereas the 750 has a smooth rocker cover enclosing everything. CB750's engine is more inclined forward. Other detail differences.  
The CB550 was developed into the CB650, which was effectively a new engine using the original bore centres. Revised top end, and a really, really good bike. Much better than the SOHC CB750s - I wish I'd kept mine. Bu the world is full of bikes we wish we'd kept.  
They probably only ditched the kickstarters on bigger models, since a lot of their new 110-160cc models have kickstarters, as far as I can see from their website.  
CB500 Four or 550 Four. The engines are outwardly identical.  
Agreed, looks like a 550f circa 76/77  
The 500T was a horrible bike. I bought three.  
A friend's girlfriend bought one from a "mechanic" that was sitting on Craigslist forever. I'm still trying to make it run right.  
The CB450 was an advanced bike for its day, but it bristled with experimental tech that Honda never used again. The 500 was just disastrous.  
The PO fitted 32mm mikunis to it. I hesitate to say vm32 because the stampings don't match for vm32, Google points to them coming off of a 70s 2 stroke snowmobile. It ran so poorly I fouled the plugs in the 4 miles from his house to mine. We've gone back to stock carbs and airboxes. Runs a ton better but needs a bit of fine tuning still.  
I wouldn't. "Build" seems to signify "rip shit off it, fit plant seat, dropped bars and wrap the pipes"  
My personal pick wouldn't be a Honda at all - it'd be a Yamaha XS650 twin.
