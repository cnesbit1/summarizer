Any recommendation for winter gear? Looking to go Switzerland and Canada. -3 degree for Europe.  -30 plus for Canada.
North face. Actually if u have time you can go to the factory outlet at the country and buy coz the winter wear u buy in sg is not as thick
Buy heat tech from uniqlo
i mean of coz you can buy in sg and wear temporary coz the -30 degrees kind of weather i tested on sg quality ones not as thick. ard $200 - 250 if i rem correct. coz i went lugano switzerland factory outlet called 'fox town' they had pretty good bargain stuff there
Been to longyearbyen and please don't forget to bring spikes for your shoes. The ice freezes over and it becomes incredibly hard to walk.
Planning to visit Yukon area after Alaska etc. after which Iâ€™m gonna be staying in Winnipeg for a few months.
It says -38 lowest for Jan lei. 
You need to factor in the wind chill too. 
There's a saying, if it's -10C outside, dress for -20C.
Also, don't short change on a pair of waterproof winter boots and a good pair of winter socks.
Funny thing is, in longyearbyen when it was -25, I was wearing only one layer of long pants. For pants I feel like one can already (or maybe I'm insane)
