Unless there's an actual referendum, these petitions are probably gonna be the best census of which camp is actually larger. Sign away!  
That's because religious leaders are actively sending it to their chat groups and encouraging people to sign. My friends that attend different churches got the message in the span of a few hours, and Im sure the same goes for mosques.  
Furthermore, the anti-repeal side is backed by powerful religious foreign organisations which the pro repeal side lack.  
Another reason is that the pro-lgbt are mainly young people, students and low level businesspeople. The older anti-repeal group (judging from user profiles) are either retired, have an iron bowl, or hold higher positions in country.  
Correct me if I'm wrong, but haven't the government come out against religious hardliners as well?  
The issue here is just whether they're willing to use that organization and activism for the other 364 days in the year besides the pink dot rally.  
But religious people have a tendency to shift goal posts and redefine what constitutes as 'reasonable' then.  
The big issue is that on the ground. The traditional bloc is always more vocal than the progressive one.  
The LGBT community needs leaders to stand up and stand out.  
The current attitude of the government towards LGBT can already be taken to be borderline aggressive, cutting Pinkdotâ€™s funding and more.  
They are oppressed in that they are denied the basic right of public housing. In SG, you can't get a flat unless your marriage is legally recognised.
