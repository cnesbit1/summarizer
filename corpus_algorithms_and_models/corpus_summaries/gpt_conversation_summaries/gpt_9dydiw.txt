Dude battled his drug addiction for awhile. There's no conspiracy here. Just sad shit.  
If you're talking about the illuminati... The illuminati didn't kill Mac Miller. Mac Miller and his very sad struggle with addiction killed Mac Miller.  
Most likely. But surely it wouldn't be difficult to lace something to get rid of someone? Not suggesting this is what happened, but you're awfully quick to dismiss the possibility of foul play  
Right? Not that everyone should jump into alternative theories, but a lot of times there is some weird circumstances around celebrity OD's. Avicii's recent passing was awfully shady  
Shit like this is what gives conspiracies their negative connotation  
I didn't suspect foul play till I read the overwhelming number of comments 100% confident that it was all an accident  
Lmao yeah you’re really using your brain there chief. Let’s not go with the obvious answer that a drug addict died to an OD. No let’s say he was killed by the Illuminati. Why was he killed? Doesn’t matter you’re using your brain so much that it’s irrelevant  
Using my brain to say that I dont actually know what happened? How do you actually know what happened? Having an open mind is using your brain. Blindly accepting whatever headlines dictate is a dangerous thing to do in today's world.  
Maaaaan, no one is arguing against using your brain for critical thinking. By all means, use your brain, but it seems like you're forcing an issue where there isn't one.
