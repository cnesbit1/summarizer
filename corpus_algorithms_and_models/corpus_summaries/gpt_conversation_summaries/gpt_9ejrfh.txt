I'd be embarrassed and worried if my boyfriend displayed jealousy like that or made a scene. I'm not his property.  
I'd handle the situation myself first and if that's not helping, I'd expect my boyfriend or girlfriends to stand by me, not for my bf to attack someone out of blue.  
Yes and I handle my own bullshit. I don't need my boyfriend sorting it out for me. That situation is patronizing. I don't need a knight in shining armour.  
Only issue I have with it is that men are generally stronger and it can be hard for a woman to fight off a guy bigger than she is.  
Obviously if the situation escalates, then I'm fine with my boyfriend/ friends getting involved. Even if someone started attacking my boyfriend, I'd held him.  
For the record, this is absolutely not the case. People never rush to your aid when being sexually assaulted in public. Especially in a place where sexual behavior is not abnormal.  
I have. I walked away with a friend (it was a girl's night out) and told security, and they took care of it.  
In the cases I've seen, guys in OP's situation have gotten assault charges while the other guy got off scot-free since "she didn't shove him off", "she was at a club dancing, that's what guys do", etc. Resorting to punching only makes things worse for the couple.  
If my life was in danger I'd expect my boyfriend to react. If I was in a situation I could react to myself, I'd want to do that.  
As a grown woman, she could've likely handled it better than what you did. I know I'd be wondering if my boyfriend saw me as a person or if he, too, felt I was unable to speak my own mind.
