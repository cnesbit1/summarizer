I'm in total control hence the post, all this anti vax stuff is actually dangerous so yeah people really should call people out on it when it comes up. It's not like enjoying different tv shows this actually has repercussions for people. I'll call out anti vaxxers out forever just like i'll call out racism whenever possible. 

No. We're complaining that you anti-vax numbnuts are risking pandemic disease because you have a 'feeling' that something is 'fishy.' If you wanted to left alone to 'feel differently'  - pick a conspiracy theory to champion that doesn't threaten the health of other people. 

You can find 1000's of examples of papers/testimonies written about vaccines working. I can also find 100's of testimonies from people supporting the flat earth theory too so that's why it's good to look at the actual science. 

I dont really trust the goverment but I do trust that at least a good deal of medical professionals care at least somewhat. I only know 1 anti vaxxer (friend of a friend) and he refuses his kid for almost every medical treatment, the kid is sickly as hell and I dont think it's a coincidence. 

It's not the same of course but the anti vaccine movement and racism are both dangerous. 

At least it will only be us anti vaxers that die in the pandemic then all you pro vaxers will be safe one again. 

Keep upholding herd immunity. 

There's plenty of evidence that tells us that vaccines do good and I've yet to see any to suggest otherwise.
