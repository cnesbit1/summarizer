I don't know about going downhill, but I was wondering when she turned into Jeanine Garofolo  
She has a 15 million dollar networth, and is essentially doing whatever the fuck she wants, so you must be pretty balling/accomplished if she's not hitting your standards of success.  
You're commening on a gif where she's interviewing a political candidate for leadership of a major state, making arguments on behalf of gay rights.  
My point is that she has more than enough money, and is using her position and wealth to pursue whatever she fucking wants.  
She's turned into an insane overly offended idiot who looks for fights in everything.  
Alright so you dont like the way she looks and her opinions. Perfect, now we all know why you think shes gone downhill.  
You do realize she was asking about something he'd actually said in the past, right?  
He's a Trump supporter. He literally thinks gays are subhumans that should be executed.  
FYI: She's 31 years old. Not exactly a child.  
I think theyâ€™re referring to the fact that he used to hangout in the dressing rooms of fashion shows.  
The women claimed that he flirted with a lot of them, and some of the girls he would hit on were underage.  
I didn't follow him around. I clicked on his profile.  
He's not a troll. This is actually what Trump supporters think and act like.  
Real men don't need to insult other people to prove they are superior.  
She did a series on being gay in different countries, can't remember the name but it was an interesting watch.  
It was a documentary about homosexuality in Brazil.  
it's from her vice series about LGBT issues, they did an episode focusing on brazil  
It is Gaycation! With Ian Daniel on Viceland I believe.  
Stephen fry did the same thing.  
Stephen Fry: out there.
