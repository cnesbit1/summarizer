I will note I’m in therapy trying to get help with a multitude of different issues.

I don’t like how women are perceived in the eyes of the world - constantly sexualized.

I can’t stand feeling objectified or observing it.

I just feel so uncomfortable in my own body I want o crawl out of it.

You just accept that these are gender roles, that they are set in stone, and that women must conform to them.

You don't hate being a woman. You hate what other people have told you being a woman means.

I feel like my current partner won’t be on board if I go against all of these women norms, and that I wouldn’t not find a partner who would accept all of these.

I’m not accepting the expectations as correct, I’m accepting them as the dominant culture in my society, and to go against that norm makes life much more difficult.

I don’t know what I like or how to get away with being myself if I do know what I want/don’t want.

I don’t like who I am at the moment, that’s accurate.

I’ve been going to therapy to try and figure that out.

I like nail polish too sometimes.

I’m not anti stereotypical women stuff, but to me dresses and skirts are very sexualizing.

I feel like the open access to our underparts is sort of teased by wearing a tube basically, idk if I’m making any sense.

I’m not sure where the sex aversion comes from really, but I hate the idea of someone looking at me and wanting to have sex with me. :(

I’m not entirely sure why I’ve slowly started hating feeling objectified.

I don’t know why I tend to take this so personally but I do.

I don’t know why I feel the need to conceal my body, I suppose out of shame and the desire to not be wanted physically by others, I don’t know.

I love when people compliment my hair and I’m all for my hair looking sexy (it’s long and red lol, highlight of my being haha), but not the rest of my body, especially in a sexual way...why? I don’t know.
