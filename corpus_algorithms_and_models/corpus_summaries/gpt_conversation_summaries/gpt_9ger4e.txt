Man up, apologize to the wife and neighbors, then do what you need to do to rectify all situations.  
Good luck man.  This was the story of my life for basically my entire 15 year drinking career.  Deciding to quit was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  Despite all the problems it caused me, I lived the way alcohol made me feel.  
For what it’s worth, nearly 2 years sober and things are actually pretty good with me and my wife now.  I put her through hell for 10 years, so there was a lot of damage to repair.  
Hey man, I can with relate exactly what you said. Just dont have 10 drinks.......binge drinking is terrible, and last year i actually quit for about 7 months.  
Eventually, I just decided “I’ve had enough” and that’s the real definition of rock bottom to me.  
Wow, our lives are very similar. One arrest, but always finding a way to justify my drinking.  
Im glad im seeking help and now it seems my wife is truly on board to help out.  
Yea man, you ever want anyone to talk to about it, I’m here.  
Much appreciated. I might take you up on that offer. Im feeling hopeful for right now, but there will be difficult times for sure.
