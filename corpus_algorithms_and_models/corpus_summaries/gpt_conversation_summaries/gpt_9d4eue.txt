In Thai language class, i was really bored so my friend dared me to snort a peppermint stick. I said to my friend "fuck you bitch! You thought i wouldn't do it right?" And then i snorted the fucking stick. On both holes my nose has. Immediate pain comes in. 

I had also asked the teacher to go outside, so i can get some warm air instead of the cold in the class. I went out and refilled my water bottle and when i came in it was like a spike hot my nose, pain rushes in, i cover my nose with my neck tie. Does not help and i sat there with mucus coming out of my nose.

TL;DR dont snort menthol sticks or you'll get a bad type of high.
