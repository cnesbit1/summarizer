As an American I find any assertion against complete freedom of religion to be absolutely shocking and disgusting. Freedom of belief and conscience is something I consider absolutely sacrosanct.  
Iâ€™m not an American, in fact I live in a country with a state religion.  
No one cares what you Yankees think anymore. Keep bombing brown people just because they have religion as the law of their land. You Yankees are so arrogant in thinking every one wants democracy and your political system.  
Forced belief imposed by the state is an oxymoron. Genuine faith is only between the individual and God.  
People's religious belief is between the individual and their maker. It is no business of the state to tell people what to believe.
