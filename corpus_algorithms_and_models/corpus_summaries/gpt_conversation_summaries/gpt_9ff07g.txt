The Holy Trinity is three "unconfused" and distinct divine persons (*hypostases*), who share one divine essence (*ousia*); uncreated, immaterial and eternal. The Father is the eternal source of the Godhead, from whom the Son is begotten eternally and also from whom the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally. The essence of God being that which is beyond human comprehension and cannot be defined or approached by human understanding. 

To beget is the fatherly equivalent of the motherly "to birth." The Son is *eternally* begotten of the Father. He is the eternal "publication" of the invisible God.
