Sleeping naked when you're alone just feels so nice. Especially when you've just put fresh sheets on the bed.  
No one tells you this stuff, but this is one of the little things you have to stop doing when you have kids. I haven’t had a perfect sleep in 11 years.  
No having kids doesn’t mean you have to stop-unless your kids sleep in your bed.  
But do you? Teach your kids boundaries (meaning knock and wait), and have a robe nearby if you need to get up.  
Or a kid comes in at 3 a.m. and pukes all over your floor. Source: have 4 kids.  
I've slept nude for years, literally never had the problem you're describing.  
I have kids too. Just keep your PJs next to the bed if they need you.  
It's not a well known fact, but kids wont die by seeing naked people. Teach them that nudity is natural and not only associated with sex instead.  
Don’t let the kids ruin it! I often fall asleep naked. My kids are at an age where they don’t care or are unimpressed by my nakedness. And I do keep a tank and shorts or a robe by the bed for when I have to tuck in the three yr old or whatever. Also lock your door. It’ll give you the 10 seconds to get dressed.  
I have 3 kids who are now all teenagers. I've slept naked since before they were born. They know to knock before entering my bedroom and it has never been an issue.
