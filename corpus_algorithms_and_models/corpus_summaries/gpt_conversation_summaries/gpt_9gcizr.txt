Based on last year can I say Ovechkin? The sheer will and drive to win the cup put him above the speed and skill of McDavid, and above the elite hockey iq of Crosby.

In a vacuum I think McDavid has either surpassed or will pass Crosby this year, itâ€™s close.

Ovi is absolutely not better than McDavid or Crosby lol

Did Kuznetsov not have a sheer will and drive to win the cup (and outscore Ovi in the playoffs)?

McDavid produced way more goals than Ovi and winning is a team accomplishment, shouldnt be used to judge two individual players

That's interesting, because I'm quite sure Ovi won the Rocket Richard trophy as the league's leading goal scorer. McDavid produced more points, not goals.
