Hockey players don't often showcase their personalities. If they do they're often criticized for it(see Cherry on Kuznetsov's celebration), which is why many players just give the generic interview answers so they won't be criticized by the media. Kuzy isn't being made fun of because of his personality, though I'm sure its great. People don't like the show boating or drawing attention to yourself as an individual too much. Subban and Ovi do get flack for being outspoken. Hockey culture(and the the sport itself) doesn't really allow for individuals to stand out. The NBA also allows for its players to embrace their personalities while the NHL its players try to blend in. Hockey culture is ass backwards, it punishes those who actually flip the bird to 'tradition' and actually showcase their personality. The NHL doesn't have a Gronk, or Tiger, or a Hamilton. Old crusty white people are so stuck in their ways of how the sport should be and how it was in the good old days that anytime a player breaks the stoic mold and has a personality beyond a plank of mold they get shit for it. No, embracing personality is definitely better than the alternative. Which is stupid because all the other big sports have all sorts of personalities. The NHL has a few, the two most namely being Ovi and PK but really more players need to come into the league just not giving a fuck about media opinion and make the league more entertaining.
