In 2017 Luis Videgaray, the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, warned Canada many times not to abandon Mexico for bilateral negotiations. Canada assured Mexico many times that it would not and insisted in only trilateral negotiations. We all know how that ended - Mexico didn't have the cajones to stand up to Trump and caved in. Mexico needs to pay a price for its treachery. Let's also remember that the outgoing regime is thoroughly corrupt. Money, murder and mayhem are what characterizes them best. They were always going to lie, cheat and steal, when it suited them, while pretending good-faith. But good-faith is a Canadian characteristic, so it was reasonable for Canada to expect reciprocity from Mexico... right up until the moment that they bent under US pressure. Now we know that the moment has passed, and that, in this deal, Canada must deal only on a bilateral basis with the US. It will be interesting to see how relations are portrayed with the new Mexican government.... and what concessions to Canada on other files they are willing to make in order to re-set relations. Look at the levels of trade between the parties to NAFTA. Trade between Canada and mexico is basically negligible compared to trade with the US. It's obvious that it isn't in Mexico's best interest to fall on their own sword for Canada. It's not that they didn't have the cajones, its that they actually care about their own people over yelling "ORANGE MAN BAD". The current Pena Nieto Administration of the PRI is center-right and leaves power in December for a left-wing Obrador Administration. Pena Nieto knew that he needed to sign any deal by December or Obrador would effectively kill negotiations and Mexico would leave NAFTA. So the decision for Pena Nieto was (1) a bad deal but better than the end of NAFTA OR (2) the end of NAFTA. He chose the former. Mexico could have negotiated a better deal if they worked with Canada but that's beside the point. They asked Canada to stick together as a team, then went their own way leaving Canada out of the negotiations and even negotiated some trilateral issues. Had Canada simply started negotiations looking out for it's own interests, we would have done better. They are all corrupt in MX. I don't think its possible to even form a government there without ties to organised crime. You would be killed. In terms of the new government, they apparently fully support this new US/Mexico agreement. And the vibe I am getting from Mexico is they are going
