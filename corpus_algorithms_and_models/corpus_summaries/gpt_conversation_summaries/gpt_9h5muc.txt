It would be one thing if the Chinese government had engaged in this behaviour without Google's knowledge, but Google's willingness to go along with the request is the antithesis of "not being evil".  
They've been doing the same thing for the United States government for 10+ years.  
It violates trust and privacy.  
China isn't some Evil Empire... they are doing the same shit as every other nation... why wouldn't you flag citizens based on interest if you had the means?! Governments have done it for centuries... to have it automated is a tyrants wet dream.
