I've read this exact same story weeks ago.... How is this possible?  
Yup. Itâ€™s essentially the same story with some details changed.  
Last time it was a jizz sock and a terrace  
thought it was a repost but the other guy threw a sock out the window/balcony (iirc?)... but basically the same thing...  
A reposting epidemic.  
an ant-cum epidemic... its how humans will lose our top-tier placement  
I dont know, the HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS part sounds kidna fishy, I've seen a fair amount of ant videos and even when they were feed sugar or somehitng the trail was not too large since not all ants of a colony have to go out to eat. (the others feed them through social stomachs)  
Back in high school we lived in a house that was prone to getting ants, and they LOVED cum. I lost many a good cum sock to the little bastards.  
Also, those ants smelled really weird when you squished them.  
Cum is mainly fructose, vitamins, and minerals including vitamin C, calcium, chlorine, citric acid, fructose, lactic acid, magnesium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, vitamin B12, and zinc.  
Thanks OP for feeding the ants with superfood!!! What a guy!!!!  
I've been seeing a bunch of similar stories this week to popular ones I've already read. Not sure if huge coincidence or purposeful reposts.  
That was a different one. Why, oh why are we drawn to stories about cum eating ants?  
And why hasn't anyone learned a lesson about cum eating ants?  
This exact thing has happened with my jizz rags multiple times. Not sure why but ants love jizz.
