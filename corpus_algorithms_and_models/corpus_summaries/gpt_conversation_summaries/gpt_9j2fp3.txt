Because historians of the time, people involved, etc. wrote about it when it actually happened. We still have lots of backing evidence. The leadership obviously changed. Coinage changed. Other people rose to power. Caesar was no longer written about as leading armies or referred to in records. There is tons of backing evidence through historical objects and records that Caesar existed, ruled, and lost that rule. My point was that we have much better evidence for Caesar. There are several different systems historians use to figure out how trustworthy different sources are.
