Luckily, Job isn't really meant to be read literally (cue the rustled jimmies)... It's a really interesting book which is composed of an older prose piece that surrounds a later piece of poetry. It explores the problem of evil, but never really gives an answer to the problem. 

One thing though is that it does a great job addressing how we deal with people who are suffering. My seminary professor pointed out that in Job we have two main responses to Job's suffering. We have Job's wife who says "curse God and die" and we have Job's friends who spent most of the time telling Job that he must have done something wrong and that he deserved what he experienced. My professor pointed out that Job's wife spoke out of love and wanting Job's suffering to end. She abandons her theology to defend Job. And her words can sound harsh, but if we place them in context and we think about how we might feel watching a loved one slowly suffering pain we couldn't imagine, the compassion in the statement becomes clear. 

Job's friends, on the other hand, defend their theology and in doing so abandon Job. They can't imagine their theological worldview being incorrect, so they throw Job under the bus in order to defend God. 

What's interesting is at the end of the Book it is Job's friends, not Job's wife that God condemns. Job ends up having to intervene on behalf of his friends to save them from God's anger. There's a powerful lesson in there about how we treat people who are suffering. 

The Book of Job actually is really fascinating when you get into it. For instance one of my assignments for my intro Hebrew class was translating the prose frame of the book. It was really interesting because for the first time I noticed that in the beginning Job is constantly offering sacrifices to the point where he offers sacrifices just in case his children crossed a line when they had a banquet. Job is quite literally defined by offering sacrifices. But when you get to the end of the book Job is a changed man. He prays for his friends after God tells him to because God is so angry with how they represented God. Then after that, there is no mention of him offering sacrifices at all, So the very thing that was so closely tied to his identity no longer seems present after his ordeal. 

The book has a lot to offer, you just have to unhitch all the baggage that's been attached to it throughout history and really dig in to see just how good it actually is. 

Great answer. I'd even go
