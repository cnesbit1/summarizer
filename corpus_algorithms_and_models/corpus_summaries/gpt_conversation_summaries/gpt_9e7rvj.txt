Is he really a dick?  It's not like he's abusing her or anything, it sounds like he's just not attracted to her after her body changed, which is completely reasonable.  Now it totally sucks, and he should probably be trying to work on improving that aspect, but it's not like attraction is completely voluntary.

&gt;I talked to him and he bluntly told me that he’s not attracted to me and that maybe i should see a plastic surgeon.

The way it sounds like he said it is dickish. Him telling the truth isn’t dickish.

People get old. Bodies change. Accidents and illnesses and, yes, babies, change us. It is life and somehow over millions of years men have managed to deal with these normal changes. When you love a person and you are attracted to them as a person, a few stretch marks are unlikely to get in your way, unless you're an entitled asshole.  WTF is she supposed to do, keep getting surgery her whole life so he doesn't have to deal with reality? No thanks.

You make the tragically stupid mistake of thinking attraction is some voluntary process you control which is impressive considering you are a human and should know better.

While the scenario OP describes sounds awful, and her husband may very well be in the wrong, your insinuation that losing attraction is immoral makes no sense. Sure, his reaction to his loss of attraction can be critisized, but the actual loss of attraction is out of his control. If she had lost attraction to him, or lost her sex drive post pregnancy, would your critisism still seem justified?

I think the confusion here is that the husbands actions and his attraction are different. You can reasonably critisize him for bringing up plastic surgery, you can't reasonably critisize him for losing attraction.
