the average incoherent straits times commenter is actually a pretty good representation of the *average* singaporean (and their language skills).  
Most Singaporeans I believe are nice people but Facebook gives some of them the avenue to spill whatever nonsense they believe in and it kills my faith in some of us  
I wouldn't be too bothered. I think online forums bring the worst out of anyone, regardless of their nationality.  
NS should be for women as well. They can even serve in the SAF. There are already women regulars there and despite there being a general difference in physical strength between men and women, modern weapons such as guns, which rely on accuracy and tactics to outmaneuver the enemy, put them on an equal playing field.  
NS is long overdue an overhaul. NS is absolutely necessary but the way it was implemented can be improved.  
Women should be paid more as well.  
I can prove in microeconomics under asymmetry of information and wage determination that women should be paid lesser if we assume their periods make them less productive.  
You do realise that some people get really bad cramps where they're basically bedridden for the day?  
Feminists want equal rights? They should fight for a place in NS too  
Totally support for females to serve NS.  
Cat welfare groups in Singapore are irritating and overbearing.  
I educate my cats and provide ample platform for them to look out the window so they won’t jump onto the ledge to do just that.  
The CWS guidelines state that meshing is needed.  
I have gay friends. I have lesbian friends.  
But don’t force it down on me to support their cause to repeal 377A cos I don’t want my future children to think it’s ok to go down that route.  
I respect their sexuality by not voicing out my opposition to it.  
I just don’t like my friends, gay or otherwise, coming to me and telling me to sign whatever petition and go to pink dot to support them.  
The LGBT community isn't the biggest in Singapore. They need the support from friends and family to make their voices heard. 377A is an outdated law and should not be held over their heads.
