Sometimes I feel like the only Grom rider who uses the bike for short commutes and casual cruising, instead of fuck boy shenanigan.  
There isn't many of us, but we do exist :)  
There are dozens of us, at least!  
Not entirely, mine is my only bike so it does everything but it's mostly getting to work and back.  
Weekends are often a bit more colourful, but at worst I speed too much. My other riding buddies are not sane, to say the least.  
Fellow Grom commuters unite! Tip of the helmet to all sane riders out there.  
Rarely is anything the problem other than the pilot.
