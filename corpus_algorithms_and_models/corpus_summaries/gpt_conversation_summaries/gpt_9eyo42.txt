When you take this fact and cross-check with what GCT said about Edwin Tong, one wonders how much pay cut Edwin actually took to become minister. According to an old interview with Shanmugum who was also a lawyer, he was paying more income tax than the minister salary he is currently getting. Both Edwin Tong and Shanmugam are high flying lawyers before their appointment as minister so their pay scale we can assume is quite similar. Edwin Tong is a minister of state so his salary is around $1.02M with AWS and 3 month bonus and 3 months performance bonus. He took a $900K pay cut assuming it is true that he earned $2M a year previously. So 40-50%, GCT wasn't making it up. Basically GCT said SMS makes about 500k a year but turns out it's more than double that. Edwin Tong, he is a Senior Counsel, he earns more than $2 million. PM asked him to be a Minister of State – one quarter (salary). He came to see me. He said, at this stage of his life, he has got a house, he has got a mother-in-law to support, a father-in-law to support, his own parents and so on, what should he do? So I asked him, Edwin, what were you in politics for? (He said) Here to serve. So I said you’ve got to serve, well, you know between $2 million and perhaps half a million, later on you hopefully become a full Minister, $1 million, you have to decide which is more important. So Edwin told me his job in politics is to serve. He said yes, I will take on, and he felt very strongly that he could do the job. But now we dare not pay Ministers a good wage. The benchmark of either 935k or 1.02mil is based on 20 months salary. The average minister bonus received being 4.5months is solely for Performance bonus (PB component), and does not include the alleged 1.5 months AVC or 5.25 months NB, nor the 13th month. If the former, then yes about 600k, if the latter then more than 1mil.
