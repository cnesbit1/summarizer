Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for. Hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered. Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all. Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are. Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle. As always please remember to read the FAQ. This thread will be refreshed each Monday. Klim is typically more American cut and is more utilitarian. Dainese is more Euro cut and... well, Italian haha. Really, you should go to a store and just try them on. If all else is the same to you, Klim REALLY backs up their gear. If your shoulders are broad Dainese won’t fit well. The Klim Apex Air saved my shoulder and arms in a crash a couple of months ago and it flows a fukton of air. As others have said, Klim is typically more ADV oriented, but their street gear (Apex/Apex Air/K-51/K52) is more protective and higher quality than the Dainese equivalents. It’s not cheap though. The D3O was awesome, definitely would have broken my collarbone without it. I hit a deer at 60mph+, flew over the handlebars and through the air for 10 or so yards and landed on my shoulder and hip on chipseal and then slid on my chest and (outstretched) arms for another 15 yards at least.
