I was hired by Bloomage, the Chinese company working with the NHL for the China Games, to be a team host for the Calgary Flames. One of the most memorable stories from the trip came post-game in Shenzhen. On the first turn in what can only be described as a labyrinth of a parking structure, our delightful bus driver rammed his right-side rearview mirror directly into two air conditioning units, shaking the entire bus as sparks flew outside the windows. Finally, another driver managed to pull the mirror back into a somewhat acceptable position, amidst the typhoon of chirps coming from the players on the bus. Another great experience was undoubtedly going to the Great Wall with the team. Best part of the day was riding down the toboggan [behind Johnny](https://imgur.com/7sLUBWg) and [in front of Jankowski and Bennett](https://imgur.com/y4w74ll). Finally, I was also [interviewed by FlamesTV](https://twitter.com/NHLFlames/status/1042288426261864453), for which I was brutally unprepared for but I tried my best. The team and staff were absolutely amazing to me, treated me with the utmost hospitality, and allowed me to feel welcome and included during my interactions with the team. Neal was hands down the most welcoming out of all of the players: he invited me to the players' dinner and sat next to me, before the Beijing game he came out and gave me his stick that he got the whole team to sign, and just as of now has followed me on Instagram.
