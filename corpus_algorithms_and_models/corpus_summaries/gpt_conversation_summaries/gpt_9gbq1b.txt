So a couple of months ago my doctor put me on a new SSRI to help with my chronic depression. I told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an SNRI and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. Well, it had been building up so long in me that I went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. Sounds great, right? Eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, I realized I had a shooting pain in my vagina, like I had badly pulled a muscle. Upon further inspection, I realized that I not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, I suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. My doctor took a look and welp, I was right, I needed stitches, and instructed me that in the future during any particularly-intense sessions, I should probably use lube, just to be safe. Ironically, now I now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so I'm back to square one.
