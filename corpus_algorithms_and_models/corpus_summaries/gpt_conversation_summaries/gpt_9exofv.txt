The point of op's video was that the beams wouldn't have to melt for them to lose structural integrity.  
You are correct. Steel beams do not have to melt to lose their structural integrity. But they do have to melt in order to completely disintegrate; which is what *actually* happened.  
Hell, even Popular Mechanics (who actually promote the official story) made this statement about the iron worker's video:  
&gt; “He openly admits that the forge he was using heated the steel beam several hundred degrees above the temperature at which jet fuel burns,” the magazine observed. “That, and he doesn’t say how long the beam has been in the forge, or offer any evidence of the forge’s actual temperature. His little experiment here is more party trick than perfect simulation.”  
What are the odds of 3 buildings to undergo perfect free fall onto itself. He bends these rods in the videos.  I'd like to see him heat up 4 rods place them in a square then take a flat surface and press down with force. Will the rods buckle and fall into themselves?  
wouldnt an inferno inside a building be burning hotter than just jet fuel?  
ps... ive seen video of firemen saying they saw melted steel, like they were in a foundry. if charges were used to melt the beams, it would have been at specific points? and would not have created a mass large enough to "flow" the way the firemen described?  
There are photos of the rubble where you can see some of the remaining steel core columns and they appear to have been cut diagonally...
