In this situation, they would come after you, the person who signed up for the internet service. If it's your network then you are responsible for anything illegal that happens on it; according to the article. Once movie and other companies that care about copyrighted material see that everyone is torrenting via VPNs, they will ask the government to get them a list of VPN users. $5000 is the maximum that they can come after you unless it's for commercial use. The only thing they have on you is the IP. You are not responsible for the act of another even if they happen to be using your property. An IP address is just that an IP address. I don't think you understand the purpose of a VPN. It offers no protection other than directing (possibly secure) traffic through another IP. Windows 10 will tell Microsoft through it's telemetry and leave a detailed footprint of your VPN use. Sadly in civil court, you are often found responsible. 'If we send you a notice telling you that your internet account is being used illegally and you do nothing to stop it from being used illegally, then you become primarily liable'. I read the article. The fact that someone gives you a general warning does not make you liable. I am explaining the current situation.
