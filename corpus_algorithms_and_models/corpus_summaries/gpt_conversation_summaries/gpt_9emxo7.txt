Thanks for that. This makes me smile :)
My favorite part was how dumbfounded the cop was at what happened. "Did he, uh.. did he just pass you? On the right?" He saw it and he still barely believed it.
It was great. I loved how he just needed to confirm yes, he really did see what he thought. I also loved the expression of resignation "yeah, he's on his phone".
