The motorcycle, a 636, blew up  
The front fell off.  
Yeah thats not very typical i would like to make that point  
“Some assembly required.”  
Condition: it blew up  
well there are a lot of these bikes going around the world all the time, and very seldom does anything like this happen, i just don't want people thinking that 636s aren't safe  
The front fell off  
It was until it blew up  
Well, one minute it wasn't blowing up, then it was blowing up, and now it's blown up.  
Because it blew up and 4.8 gal of fuel spilled and the street caught fire, it's a bit of a giveaway, I would just like to make the point that that is not normal.  
Oh, very rigorous.
