Linking personal information is a bannable offence. This isn't the place to start a witchhunt.  
Linking both the usernames and the comments themselves fall under the umbrella of "personal information". In future, please read the sidebar before posting.  
As I have already explained, no real names and no usernames.  
&gt;2) Do not post any identifiable information, names, or usernames. This is a bannable offence.  
This includes social media profiles and Reddit accounts.  
It's pretty clear, you just need to read the rules.  
Let's not resort to racially charged insults, thanks.
