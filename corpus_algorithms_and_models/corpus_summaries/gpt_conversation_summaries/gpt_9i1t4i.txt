Christians are commanded to judge good and evil. So if that's what you call judgmental then the answer is because it's part of being a Christian. It's like asking "why do Christians fight against sin?" It's central to Christianity.  
Being judgmental means looking down on other people.  
“Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2 For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.  
Most people feel judged when they are told something they did is wrong.  
Looking down on other people is not necessarily a Christian thing. Everyone does it.  
I think that it's okay for us as Christians to say something is a sin but I'd say judging a person or being judgemental is completely different.  
What? Christians are explicitly commanded NOT to judge others. The more you judge others, the more judgement you will receive, and be careful, because you, too, are evil.  
In the end Christian beliefs on sin will rub people the wrong way, but that does not give us an excuse to hate, abuse, or not love individuals.  
Christians should start with judging themselves. We are all sinners and evil.  
We are children of god he loves us that includes me you and everyone else  
Christ died for us. Let’s be forgiving and accepting of others show them the love and salvation and mercy we are blessed with  
We cannot judge anyone’s eternal fate however we must judge whether teachings are good or evil, whether actions are sinful or good, whether character is mature or immature, etc.  
Because that’s only the start of the passage. The following verses make it clear that ‘don’t judge’ isn’t absolute statement but a conditional one - don’t judge until you’ve examined yourself and don’t judge unless you do it graciously, conscious of the grace you have received.
