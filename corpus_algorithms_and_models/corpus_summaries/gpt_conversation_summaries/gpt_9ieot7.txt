There's a complex psychological aspect to gangstalking and "TI's". I see it as another kook pool they've generated.  
It's very similar to the panopticon, in that as long as somebody \*feels\* as if they are under surveillance, no actual surveillance is necessary.  
So you have lots of conspiracy theorists who get spooked or scared that they're being "targeted" by some element within TPTB, be it the CIA or some black ops group, and they watch a bunch of youtube videos on the subject, and I think they get absolutely caught up in the idea that they are important enough to have a surveillance program authorized against them.  
Then, you assume that anybody you encounter in your daily interactions could be an "agent" deployed against you.  
Gangstalking is real, our government did this shit to Hemingway. But most of the time I agree with you, it's just conspiracy theorists with delusions of grandeur being paranoid thinking gangstalking is a major problem plaguing our nation today.
