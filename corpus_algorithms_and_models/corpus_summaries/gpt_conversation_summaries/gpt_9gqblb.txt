I believe the manga version of the Bible to be the only accurate translation.  
As a Southern Baptist I would just like to add that The manga version of the Bible is inerrant.  
I have a few of these. They were coming out while I was in Japan and I love them. The idea is that Japanese people are more likely to read a manga about Jesus than a word-only Bible. I gave one to my Japanese host mom and she definitely read it. Good stuff  
The Bible in OP's picture is the New Living Translation.  It's actually just a standard Bible with an additional super-condensed ~40 manga pages illustrating stories from the Old Testament, and ~40 manga pages illustrating the Gospel.  
Well...it kind of depends on your goal. Would I recommend it for a study bible? Definitely not, lol. What you lose in a comic-presentation is precision. There’s interpretation necessarily going into what people look like as they say or do things.  
However, if you’re talking about introducing the Gospel to people who don’t even know the cross is a Christian symbol, then it’s wonderful. It’s a “their world” way of making the scriptures accessible.  
I mean...my Japanese host mom was 65 and active in Buddhism, but because of this book she read the Bible. She heard the Gospel. She would never have opened a regular Bible, but she read the manga.
