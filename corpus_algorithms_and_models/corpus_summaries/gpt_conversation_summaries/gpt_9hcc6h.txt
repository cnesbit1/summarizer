I always had this question, how do we know it's reliable ? Just because there's external evidence of something related to the Bible doesn't mean that it's true. Thanks It’s God’s word. How do you know that? Faith. Plenty of people have faith that the Koran is the word of god. How do you measure that your faith is more correct than theirs is? Jesus is the messiah who fulfilled all the prophesies of the Old Testament. Muhammad was an illiterate pedophile Jew killer. He was the Hitler of his time. The Koran has more Jew hate in it than Mein Kampf. Islam is a satanic religion no connection to Christianity. How do you know Jesus was the messiah? I'll view this later, but are you incapable  of summarizing the evidence behind your beliefs? Because all you have to do is watch 5-10 minutes of that video. I’m not going to start listing all the Bible verses of Jesus proving that he’s the messiah only to get 5 downvotes from atheists who don’t care. Where does it say that? Hold on. Why should I care about what bible versus say? What makes them more legitimate than, say, Koran versus, or scripture from any other holy book? This is starting to sound like circular reasoning. Trust me, I'm not downvoting based on whether I agree or disagree with people, but based on whether they are contributing to the discussion.
