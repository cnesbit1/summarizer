I can see what they type before sending and sometimes see stuff like "omg I'm an idiot" that gets erased and replaced with a thank you. I try to be really nice to those people.  
Depends on the software used but yes, a lot of industry standard chat based support offers live preview of what the customer's typing.  
I'm not sure what exactly you'd be worried about them learning about in a customer service chat.  
This is what working in customer service feels like.  
TBH I once had almost this exact conversation when working in customer service  
*Lady:* I can't remember my password for the website. Can you reset it?  
*Me:* **I** can't, no miss. But I can direct you on how to do it yourself.  
*Lady:* YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SMARTASS ABOUT IT!  
*Me:* I... Wasn't? That's how you-  
*Lady:* I wanna speak to your manager!  
“I’m trying to order a steak and cheese and it’s telling me to pick my cheese”  
“Ok what kind of cheese do you want?”  
“Doesn’t steak and cheese normally have American?”  
“Uhm I’m not sure. These are all completely customizable so you can put whatever you want on it”  
“*Grumbles* Ok this says do I want it toasted? I don’t want the bread toasted”  
“Ok you can just hit no”  
“Normally steak and cheese isn’t toasted? *HUFFS*”  
“I’m not sure what kind you’re talking about. These are made exactly how you order it”  
Angrily “Ok, thanks” Eyeroll
