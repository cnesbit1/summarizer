In St. Louis, the Rams were neglected and the fans could see nothing good happening. There has always been talk of a team in Quebec City--what is stopping Melnyk from moving the Sens there? I don't know the whole Senators story, but I just see nothing but shit coming out of there and had a thought... Everybody knows that hockey wonâ€™t ever work in the snow and they should just relocate the Senators to Houston. The previous owner of the Rockets (Leslie Alexander) was a dick and didn't like the fact that the NHL wouldn't give him a team after he tried to buy the Oilers from Pockington and move them to Houston. He kept the Aeros just to show the NHL that he supported hockey, but they never seriously considered letting him have a team. So in 2013, he was like fuck it, jack up the lease for the Aeroes. The Wild didn't want to pay, so they moved the Aeroes to Iowa. What does Dallas having a team have to do with Houston getting one? There's hardly any Stars fans here in Houston because the vast majority of Houstonians would refuse to cheer for anything related to Dallas.
