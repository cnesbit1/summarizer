The only extension we expected to see from Cbus. No others looming...at all...  
I'm pretty sure Bob and Panarin are both UFAs at the end of the year.  
I'd assume most CBJ fans are hoping to lock up their star forward and franchise goalie long term  
Panarin is in his contract year but it’s pretty clear he doesn’t want to re-sign  
Panarin gave them to start of camp to do something and then he wouldnt sign. Granted he more than likely wasn't going to sign anyways and clearly wants out.  
I'm hoping you guys can sign Bob since I feel like the team would drop off hard without him.  
Bob would be great I just don't want to overpay too much and be stuck with him and nothing else like some other teams that overpaid their goalie.  
Which is totally understandable and I think might be the inevitable reason the Jackets end up losing Bob is he wants more than the Jackets want to pay him so they don't get stuck in that situation  
We also have 2 mini-Bob's behind him in Korpisalo and Merzlikins (who will no doubt be over here next season).  
Panarin has apparently made it clear he doesnt want to re sign, and apparently Bob is asking for WAY too much money  
The Price contract is fucking up the market. Bob's the only active goalie with multiple Vezinas, and he's apparently asking $10M, which is $500K less than Price.
