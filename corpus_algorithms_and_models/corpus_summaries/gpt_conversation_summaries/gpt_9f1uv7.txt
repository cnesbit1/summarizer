God, I hope I can get a good GPA so that I can progress to Polytechnic and followed by, University. NTU if possible.  
Iâ€™m currently studying in ITE College West and majoring in Nitec in Business Services.  
Fingers crossed,pursing a dip in archi and 1st sem results release in 8 days  
Now on month 4 of going semi-vegetarian. Recently my mom bought roast duck and roast pork, and I did not enjoy chewing through the meat at all. Interesting that my brain is changing. I still enjoy eating the salty and fatty skin though.  
I eat veges weekdays, but on weekends if I visit my parents I don't want to trouble my mom. So I just eat whatever she cooks.  
Losing weight, lower cholestrol, cured my IBS.  
Hello! Recently my gf and i found this restaurant called greendot where they serve mock meats for dishes ranging from herbal soup to rendang!  
There was a time where I didn't eat meat for 5 days. Surprisingly, I thought that I would crave for meat after days of not eating it, but I didn't even feel like eating meat after that few days, until I have to eat it.  
Sigh, working late again today. Any good song suggestions for bad days like these?  
Edit: Y'all are awesome. Thank you!! :')
