During sex I lactate. It doesn't bother my bf at all but it got me curious. Does it bother you when your girl lactates?  
Don't have to be a mother in order to lactate. Stimulation over time can cause a woman who never gave birth to lactate.  
Induced lactation. Some people do it for sexual/fetish reasons but it's usually intended for adoptive mothers who are getting newborns and want to breastfeed.  
There are also circumstances whereby men can be [induced to lactate](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/strange-but-true-males-can-lactate/).  
The only thing that bothers me is that soon after the birth of each of our kids my wife had a hard time seeing her breasts as sexual and really wanted me to stay away.  
Just for the sake of insight, for a lot of women it’s not even just that they don’t see their breasts as sexual (although that’s very common too) it’s that they’re feeling overtouched.  
I could deal with everything else but man I couldn’t tolerate much of anything chest related during that time.  
I LOVE cuddling and being touched all the time, except when I’m nursing 24/7.  
I’m way more averse to my 4 year old than my 4 month old sometimes, but when I haven’t had my body to myself in a while I don’t want anyone touching me, even my husband.  
It’s really hard to be a good mom and a good partner when you’re so touched out!  
I would never presume to tell another mom what to do, but FWIW I LOVE having a 3.5 year gap.  
The only reason I haven’t wanted to wait is my husband’s experience growing up.  
I think there is a line though, isn't there? I am 8, 10, and 18 years older than my siblings.  
I love my siblings, but I didn't love being their mother. Be careful with age gaps is my only point.
