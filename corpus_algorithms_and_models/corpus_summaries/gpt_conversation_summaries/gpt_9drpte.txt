As it is, many middleground Singaporeans couldn’t care less what happens behind closed doors, but they wouldn’t be caught openly supporting the LGBT movement either. And this is also the exact same mentality the govt has adopted as well, because it isn’t worth risking the lashback from their conservative/religious base. I would argue that the government's stance on 377A (and other things like media regulations) are hampering debate and the natural evolution of opinions though. If people only ever hear negative things about LGBT people, or are ignorant about what being LGBT is or the problems they face, they're not gonna be convinced by one person trying to change their mind. Legalizing homosexuality might cause more tension within society and between our neighbours and that kind of harm might not be worth removing a law that isn't enforced anyway. MediaCorp can't air "pro-homosexuality" content. Mass Effect almost got banned here because got the gay romance questlines. Attempts to normalise homosexuality in sexuality education classes by vendors in schools get slapped down with the fury of a thousand middle aged mothers. The % of Muslims is similar in both countries. The only *significant* difference is that Singapore has a much higher % of Christians and Catholics. So just to clarify - people from those two groups are bigots that preventing social progress. Let's call a spade a spade. Social media doesn't do anything here, and as much as it spreads messages supporting one side, the other side has equal opportunity to make use of such a medium.
