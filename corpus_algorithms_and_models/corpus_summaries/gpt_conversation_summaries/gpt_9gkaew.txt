Not a troll, per se. Just someone who shakes his head whenever people report "MISSING" ad nauseum, but who don't edit or remove those when the issue is resolved, thus perpetuating the cycle over and over.

I try to approach people on my social media feed to address the continuation of obsolete news, but since it doesn't affect them directly they don't care.

Ah well, what can ya do, eh? Just sit back and watch as concerned citizens try their best to raise awareness, all while being unaware of reality.

While it is true sometimes you cant fix people who dont want to learn, I personally am more happy just personally knowing the story has a happy end. Or if not a happy one, at least closure.

I had a cousin (he's going to college for journalism no less) that confidently reported on FB that 76 people had died a few hours after Florence had made landfall.

Do you get that thing where you try to point out their outdated news, but they turn it around that you're the asshole for pointing out their discrepancy?

Got to take news from Facebook with a grain of salt.
