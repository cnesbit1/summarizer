I'm a seventeen year old Asian and a freshmen at a Community College. So, yesterday night I called my cousin and cried to him about how one of the classes I’m taking right now is one of the most difficult thing I ever came across (The class is Human Anatomy and Physiology). I told him that I was going to fail because of an exam on Thursday and I already failed a quiz. My cousin told me it was best to slow down because of all the homework, quizzes and exams from the other classes can cause me to stress. I called my cousin because I knew my dad was going to think that I wasn’t fully giving the class my 100 percent. I explain to him that I didn’t want to disappoint him because he invested so much money in me and I didn’t want the money to go to waste. He told me to go ask a advisor about dropping the class and whether we would get a refund. When I asked the front office about withdrawing, they handed me a withdraw slip and next thing I knew, I was out of the Human Anatomy class (looking back at it now, I made one of the most dumbest move ever). He said that it was best to keep the class and fail than withdraw (I think it was better to withdraw, because then my GPA won’t drop if I failed, but what do I know). I felt like shit there and then and still. I know it was a really bad decision made by me. I apologize for making you read this stupid terrible written story, but I just couldn't hold it in me anymore.
