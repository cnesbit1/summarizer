Here is video of Alex Jones from January of 2014 where he says:

"Sandy Hook is a synthetic, completely fake, with actors...manufactured. I couldn't believe it at first."

One of my interns personally knew one of the adults who died there. Hard for me to believe otherwise; she was an honest person.

I don't know how you could get so misinformed. There were 6 adults and 20 children killed. If you aren't willing to do basic research before calling someone a liar, you have a problem. And that type of ignorance doesn't belong in a sub like this.

Lmao, no shit the official narrative is a thing. No one died and no one was shot. You know what doesn’t belong in a sub like this? Users who don’t contribute conspiracy material and who think Sandy Hook was a real shooting.

Lol what a spastic. For many here including me Sandy Hook was the first conspiracy theory they ever got into. Because it’s so obvious that it’s top to bottom, front to back, 100% a goofy **hoax** which has been proven a hundred different ways now. What a joke you are, asking me for proof when there’s 6 years of proof piled up for anyone to readily see already — despite the desperate censorship on YouTube, Facebook, and elsewhere. I can and would gladly embarrass you anytime about Sandy Hook if you had the balls to debate about it.

And yet I've never seen a single drop of evidence that held any weight, and you haven't presented us with any. You're full of it.
