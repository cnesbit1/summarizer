Your doors don't open from the inside without a key? Do you live in an old medieval castle with a bunch of large iron keys on a big metal ring?  
Pretty common n a lot of places in Europe that you need the key to open the door if it's locked.  
This is what I'm confused about. Why the hell would you ever want to be locked ***inside*** your house?  
Door could have a deadlock (or deadbolt), which canâ€™t be moved into the open position without a key.  
Most of Europe does it that way.  
American doors with bolts have a mechanical lever on the inside to pull the bolt left and right.  
I live in Europe and it's the same in all the apartments and houses I've been to and lived in.  
If the door is locked, you need a key to open it both from inside and from outside.  
If you have a door that has window panes or sidelights, then you would typically have a lock that requires a key on the inside, to prevent someone from unlocking it through a busted window.  
If the door was closed with a key then it is also needed for the opening. Otherwise, if the door was just shut closed it can be opened from the inside without the key.  
If you have a door that has window panes or sidelights, then you would typically have a lock that requires a key on the inside, to prevent someone from unlocking it through a busted window.  
If you just close the door, you can open it from the inside normally with the handle, but when the door is locked you need to have a key on both sides. At least that's how most/many doors are here in Germany.  
In America, most of our door locks look something like [this.](https://www.directdoorhardware.com/assets/images/weslock/deadbolts/272.jpg)  
In Belgium, like I said, all I've ever seen are door with a look (security locks or just regular ones) and you always need the key.
