Yes I've been to therapy. Yes I've been on medication. It improved my life quite a lot but it plateaued out and now I'm here.

My current BF is an absolute sweetheart. He's caring and responsible and tries to make me happy in any way he can. He's learned new techniques in the bedroom and bought me multiple toys to try and help sex become better for me. Nothing has worked.

I'm just. Numb.

My skin is numb. I can't feel excitement. Touching my clit in any way other than the exact one way that I know works doesn't just *not feel good* it *hurts*. Unless I've been edging myself all day, penetration sucks and feels good maybe 10% of the time. We can't try any new positions because only two actually work for me and give me a solid chance of getting off.

So I called it quits. I can manage on my own and that's good enough for me. The BF doesn't want to have sex unless it's good for me and since it's not good for me we aren't having sex. My BF is into pegging and I still perform oral for him, but I don't make it about anything but him. We'll kiss and touch a bit, but that's about as far as I let it go for my own needs.

But just because I'm broken doesn't mean that my BF has to be alone so I'm just focusing on that for now.

He is never going to give me an orgasm because no one can. It's not going to happen. So there is really no point in telling him.

I'm 40. I've been having sex for 22 years. It isn't possible. I'm sorry, I know you mean well! But I have found a way to enjoy sex without them, and that is by serving my boyfriend.
