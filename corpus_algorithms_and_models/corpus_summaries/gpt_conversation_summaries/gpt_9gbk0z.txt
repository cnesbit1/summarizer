Growing up in the church gets really confusing when you are deemed old enough to be taught about a biblical approach to sexuality. My generation had a plethora of resources at our disposal: "I kissed dating goodbye" "silver ring thing" "true love waits" "purity rings" "purity pledges" were all around us. Through these media, I learned that love was like a quantity. Metaphors like spit in a cup, pre-chewed gum, flower with it's petals pulled off were used to show us that those who engaged in premarital sex were as worthless as used or damaged goods. In recent years, books about the damage done by purity culture teachings laser-focus on virginity, shaming non-virgins, destroying their self-worth has come to light. How can we as the current generation of leaders of the church change the dialogue to create a more sex-positive message that helps the next generation walk in truth and not lies and fear? The simplest answer is to insist on the Bible's teaching on matters of sexuality but not go beyond the Bible. The solution to weird sexual repression is not sexual libertinism but teaching the whole counsel of God. The problem is that people are trained not to read or trust the bible really. Many modern churches believe theology that really isn't biblical. I worry though, the Bible wasn't written with our world in mind. There was no real sense of equality when the Bible was written. It was a patriarchal setting where women were secondary and subordinates of the men in their lives.
