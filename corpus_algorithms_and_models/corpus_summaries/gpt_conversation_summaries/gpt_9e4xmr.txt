I find the law in Singapore to be quite biased and unfair to men. Furthmore, men are required to enlist for 2 years and continue to be a reservist which definitely affects their career etc. Women are *perceived* to be weaker, therefore they are *treated* better by the law. Men are *perceived* to be stronger, therefore the law *treats* them worse. So things like NS are men-only because women are perceived as too weak to handle it. Depending on how you look at it, you can see this as discrimination against either gender. Well, yeah. But I believe that the more controversial and relevant part about NS, which is the fact that only men are legally required to undergo it, is the thing under discussion here. I'd have thought that was obvious given the nature of this post and the other comments. In this case, the discrimination is solely one way. Men are perceived to be stronger, and thus are forced to serve NS. However some women are also perceived to be as strong, and are therefore also allowed to serve in the army if they wish to. Where's the discrimination against women? For us to be able to say that there isn't discrimination/minimal discrimination, women as a whole should be perceived and treated the same as men as a whole. If anything, men are still the ones being discriminated against. All men are expected to be strong and have to serve and have no choice in the matter. For equality, it should be compulsory for both men and women to serve NS (or neither, but I err on the side that our defence would be a mess without NS, which is a separate argument). Taking into account the biological fact that women are weaker, perhaps women can serve in less physically strenuous vocations? Equity, then, not equality. How you treat someone is based on how you perceive them, whether that perception has a factual basis or not. If you perceive someone to be weak, you would treat them better to protect them or because you think they can't handle something. So men are treated worse (regarding NS requirements) because they are perceived to be stronger. Women are treated better (no compulsory NS) because they are perceived to be weaker. The tangible harm is to the men; I'm just pointing out another way of looking at the problem of inequality in NS conscription. There's no real problem per se, it's just that the view of women being "weaker" is itself the discrimination. If the definition of discrimination is that one treats someone else
