We start with the premise that we know nothing about God except what He chooses to reveal to us.

As God reveals himself in the Bible, He gives us the ritual and standards of conduct and purity that we should follow.

The ritual or clothing isn't really for God, it is for us.

God must not be very good at revealing himself then because the Bible makes him look like an evil tyrant.

I also think that God-inspired people in the Bible were probably influenced by the times and contexts that they lived in, and that nobody has necessarily heard the exact direct word of God.

I also see in the Bible a progression of humanity.

God is very good about revealing himself exactly as you wish to see.

21st Century standards may be more advanced overall, but that doesn't make them more appropriate for the BCE situation either.

If a prophet spoke out against slavery, whether he was God-inspired or not, people may have not listened to him, not written down what he said, or who knows, maybe even killed him.

Slavery in the Old Testament was more like short-term indentured servitude.

God recognizes that we humans constantly enslave ourselves.

The OT law began that and Christ fulfilled it.

Why would the one true God care about differentiating himself from false god(s) who don't even exist?

The trick is not openly and honestly revealing himself to people who are looking for him.

How many people haven't heard of Jesus?

The best tricks are the ones right in front of you.

Do you believe your morality is infallible?

The only evidence we have for supernatural claims made about Jesus is the Bible and it's a very flawed book.

If I could be reasonably certain it was true, I'd believe in it.

Yes but you are implying that God's condoning of slavery is somehow moral because it serves a greater purpose that I don't understand.

Slavery was born in a period in which violence was the absolute norm.

Only when the language of society shifted to Faith, and then Reason, could it be removed.

And even then, slavery is not dead - far from it.

Our whole society is founded on nominally indentured, nominally free, servants making our things for insulting wages.

It is, obviously.

Otherwise it wouldn't be a geographical phenomenon.

If your born in the states your likely to be Christian.

If your born in Turkey your likely to be a Muslim.

Human selected.

The definition of condone is to accept and allow (behavior that is considered morally wrong or offensive) to continue.

I think the word fits perfectly.
