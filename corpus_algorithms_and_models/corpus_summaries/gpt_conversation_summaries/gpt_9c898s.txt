> In 2001, the woman said, Mr. Lauer, who is married, asked her to his office to discuss a story during a workday. When she sat down, she said, he locked the door, which he could do by pressing a button while sitting at his desk. (People who worked at NBC said the button was a regular security measure installed for high-profile employees.)

There's always a chance someone will hire him because it's always possible someone else in the industry lacks morals. All this article shows is that he's creeping back around, which was inevitable as time passed from the accusations and his being fired. We have no idea what went on beyond the accusations so there's many possible reasons as to why he was never charged.

&gt;One complaint came from a former employee who said Mr. Lauer had summoned her to his office in 2001, locked the door and sexually assaulted her. She provided her account to The New York Times but declined to let her name be used. She told The Times that she passed out and had to be taken to a nurse.

Now, I don't know exactly what Laurer did to get fired. But, if it wasn't important enough to file a police report then it didn't rise the level of criminality, nor should it be considered anything but a private matter between the parties involved. And if they don't think it's important enough to air out the details in public then frankly, I don't care.

You realize that rape is a traumatic event and that many victims don't report it because of all the bullshit they'd have to go through at trial. And most rapists walk free anyway so even if a victim took their rapist to trial, odds are in the rapist's favor. So the alternate theory to your's is that the victim didn't want to bring a national celebrity to court only to have said celebrity lawyer up good and whoop their ass in court, and then everyone thinks they lied about being raped. Considering all the things we know he was fired for, is one more rape really all that hard to believe?
