You don't think logically while raging.

I've seen driver's hit and run over bikers JUST because they don't like motorcycles.

Yes. They generally have a grudge against all bikers because of a previous encounter with a different biker. I've seen it happen.

So you've seen bikers get HIT and RUN OVER for NO OTHER reason than being on a bike. The biker was just minding his own business following the law and BLAM. Out of nowhere a car smashes the biker and the only reason the car did it was because the guy was on a bike.

I was a mountain biker for decades before I got into motorcycling, I've been hit-and-run on my bike, and I've seen cars intentionally clip cyclists because they were mad they were in the road.

I've had a guy run out of his driveway on foot in front of my motorcycling waving his arms and yelling "that's enough of that!". He apparently thought I was the loud bike that drives through his neighborhood at night.

Had a neighbor who was a mechanic, worked on all sorts of cool shit. But one night he was working on a Harley and thought it would be okay to rev it up and down the street at 11p. I let him know it was not okay, by standing in the middle of the street in my PJs.
