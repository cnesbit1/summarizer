Haha, thanks for the laugh my friend. The irony out there is indeed something...  
no problem, thanks for your responsible ownership. I don't have a gun (I'd like to) cause I live in the city and wouldn't be able to use it without driving out of the city or to the range but I respect people like you who enjoy the rights this country offers, wish people wouldn't demonize you!  
Yeah thank you for your support it is shame that the statistically safest demographic in this country (licensed gun owners) get vilified and blamed for those who are violent.  
I am a member of an outdoor range, but my wife is a member of an indoor range so she can practice her handgun shooting (she is a registered Black Badge IPSC competitor) regardless of the weather (she is also a member of the same outdoor range I am).  
Either way you should take the CFSC and CRFSC just to learn firearm safety and responsibilities and maybe for for your PAL. It may give you an excuse to find a place to spend a weekend away from the city; hunting, clays or just plinking in the bush.  
Yeah, there is only one indoor range in the city limits that has grandfathered status after the City's ridiculous ban on Ranges in 2007 (?) right?  
Still go through the process of getting your PAL; its worthwhile on its own, even if you have limited opportunities. You could at least own a 22 that you could take out camping or something.  
I agree that shaming someone for owning a gun is quite an asshole thing to do, but isnâ€™t there a difference between virtual guns an physical ones?  
Physical guns tend to cost a lot more.
