Sometimes I can go forever and have to mentally try to orgasm. Other times I can barely last 2 minutes and have to bite my own fingers to distract myself. It's really annoying. Sometimes I'm a porn star. Sometimes I'm a two pump chump. For me it's mostly stress related. If you focus and control your breathing you can pretty much go for 30 minutes easily. I read on here once that if you go pee before scrumping, you'll last longer. So I tried it, and it actually worked. Sometimes he's more sensitive than others, sometimes more aroused mentally ahead of time, sometimes he can go for what feels like ages and is multiorgasmic, other times he's one and done over the course of, like, 10 minutes. Also depends on how long since last tone. If it’s been a week and I haven’t taken care of business myself, I could be fine before she gets undressed. I think it has to do with the fact that the muscles you tense to stop yourself from peeing are right in there with the muscles that tense as you near orgasm. Definitely include a "how many times have I got my rocks off recently" factor. If the recent frequency is high, there is a much greater chance of porn star grade performance.
