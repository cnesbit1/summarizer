My boyfriend and I have been together for five months. Our relationship is great and we truly deeply care about eachother. There is one problem though: he has a secret kink which he has kept me in the dark about and I’m really nervous he’s hiding it from me because he’s afraid it will scare me off. I know this because a month into our relationship he asked me my kinks after I answered I asked him the same. He told me he does have something he’s into but he hasn’t really told too many people about it and that it makes him uncomfortable to talk about so soon. I immediately felt bad and told him that he could take his time and tell me when he was ready. I know this subject is sensitive but it’s been around four months since we had that conversation. I guess my question is, is it fair for me to bring it up again? I want to approach this in a way that is appropriate. I just need to know because it’s killing me not to. (Edit: seriously he wouldn’t bring it up if he didn’t want to admit somehow. Be open as hell and let him know je won’t be judged). Yes, it's possible. It happens to all of us with respect to something, whether it's food, television, sports or sex—or whatever else. Thought I’d update you since you asked! So I was literally stressed for no reason at. All. I texted him I wanted to talk about something personal and sexual and he figured it out right away. The actually convo went really well too he was just pretty embarrassed about it. After like 15 min he finally admitted to it. Out of principle and because he really really wants no one to know I won’t tell you anything specific but it’s literally the most random thing, like super benign and not scary at all. Anyways I’m glad I asked and he said he was probs going to tell me soon anyway since he was worried I was going to think it was something serious that requires a lot of discussion and thought like CNC. So yah, worked out really well and our relationship is stronger than ever. Thanks for the advice!!
