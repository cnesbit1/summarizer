In late august, he was on tour in Washington DC, where he allegedly rented out a whole restaurant so he could eat with a model who recently turned 18. They met when she was 16, at his show, backstage. Fast forward to last week, they ate at the empty DC restaurant and then she posted a picture of them showing some PDA with the caption .. “No place I’d rather be ❤️” It should be mentioned that this model, Bella Harris, is the daughter of James Samuel Harris, who is a pretty powerful guy in the Music industry from his songwriting back in the day. Until an article is published on Drakes close friendship with Millie Bobby Brown, who is 14. Several outlets claimed the pictures were from a long time ago when they first met which were clearly going out of their way to protect Drake, since the pictures are actually still up on her instagram. I dont believe a 14 year old is an adult & he met the other girl backstage when she was 16. Teenage girls classically seek out older men, while some are terrified. There is no cookie cutter answer. We're all people, and the person is what should be addressed, not just a law written down. If she is under 18, and you dont know her, theres no need to have a close relationship with them. End of fucking story.
