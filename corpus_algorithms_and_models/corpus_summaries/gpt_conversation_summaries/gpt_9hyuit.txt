Canberra block 105 coffeeshop, malay auntie sell superb bagus curry potato puffs and sardine puffs at $1.20 each. Big and well stuffed, very nice. Used to operate at old Woodland bus interchange but relocated. If you stay around the area can come buy, super worth it. 👍🏻👌🏻  
The best kind of curry puff is the type with thin and slightly crispy skin, usually sold by mamak shops and malay snack or food stalls.  
Okay lah maybe I don't like the chang kee curry puff. That one feels too doughy to me.  
I like the flaky flaky kind that crumbles when you bite into it, I don't mind those.  
I do like the normal, flaky kind that's more like crispy toast rather than some doughy bread  
Many years ago the ock puff had generous filling where your could bite into small chunks of chicken with every bite, the skin was good enough to eat on its own, and they cost less than a dollar.  
Lol my grandmother comes and makes them sometimes and now and then as a treat my mom would make homemade ones.
