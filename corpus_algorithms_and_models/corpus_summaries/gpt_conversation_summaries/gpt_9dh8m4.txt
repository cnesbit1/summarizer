I am happy with my small breasts but I want my ass to be nice. I have had people comment on how flat my ass is. I am petite and small in general but I also dislike the shape of it as well, I have started a workout program so hopefully I will see improvements with my butt. If you seriously believe your butt is too small you can change it by going to the gym 3-4 times a week. Bridges and weighted hip thrusts give more butt focus and won't make your thighs explode in size as much. Squats lots and lots of squats is the best way to a round ass. It's going to take more than a couple months, probably at least 6. You won't be too bulky. You simply won't be working out hard enough to even come close to a fitness competitor or bodybuilder level and that assumes you are working out hard enough that your periods stop and you are puking every day. Also, remember that it does not matter what guys want or what other people want. If you are not happy with your butt because you are not happy, then do something about it. My wife had always had a really flat butt. She has been going to the gym for the past 8 months and I can definitely tell a difference, even after just 3-4 month.
