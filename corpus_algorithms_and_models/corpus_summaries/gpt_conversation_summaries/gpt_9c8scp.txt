God created mankind in his image externally..

 *God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.* [Genesis 1:26-27]

But he didn't create them in his image internally..

*“For God knows that when you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”* [Genesis 3:5]

However, he begot his Son, Jesus Christ, in his exact likeness..

 *The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.* [Colossians 1:15]

Jesus Christ is the exact likeness of God.
Jesus Christ is God.
He's the exact likeness of God. If you worship him as God than you must also worship his Father as a greater God.
God is Triune. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. One God.
John 1:1, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
