I went to an episcopal service somewhat recently in a wealthy area and it was beautiful. The building was brick and the interior had beautiful wooden structures, unlike a modern carpeted Methodist Church, it had a very traditional architecture. Also, real wine was used for communion instead of grape juice, and the preacher had the attire of a catholic priest, with the white square on his collar.

Iâ€™ve heard that a Lutheran service is also very Catholic-esque, is this true? What other Protestant denominations have these catholic elements?

Catholicism teaches Tradition and Scripture balanced. I don't care if you agree or not, that's what it teaches. Period.

Arguably we wouldn't have either without the church. We might have a bunch of writing around that's about what we believe, stories that hold some wisdom, and about important people related the the religion but what makes those writings scripture is that they're given sanctity and authority. So without the Church there isn't really anybody to give those writings that sanctity and authority.

The canonicity of writings also probably wouldn't be without the Church either. The Church declaring things canon is affirming that those writings are genuine. That they're written by the people who claimed to have written them. The events in them actually occured. The people mentioned in them actually were. And whatever it teaches is actually truth.

The canon certainly exists independantly from the church -- if something is inspired, it is indeed inspired. 

The problem (which makes it sort of a null question): we only *know* what's inspired because the church said so. It, by the holy spirit and through the means of the knowledge of the teachings of the apostles, discerned what was inspired among the works that it knew.
