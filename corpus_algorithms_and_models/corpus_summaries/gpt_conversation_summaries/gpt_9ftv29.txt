Are you by watching it contributing to the growth of sexual immorality? There are 1 million better things to do.  
No Christian should like that. Christians are supposed to HATE sin - love people but hate sin.  
Christians don’t even necessarily agree on that. Out of the three references that we translate “homosexuals” in the New Testament, two aren’t even actually about homosexuality, and the other doesn’t condemn it as sin, just calls it “unnatural.”  
If God doesn’t want a gay person to be gay, (and it is in no way your job to determine that) then He will convict them.  
There’s a reason Christians are known as bigots, and that’s because far too many of us show condemnation to homosexuals and others when we shouldn’t be.  
You realize that no biblical scholar holds this view. Homosexuality is sexual immorality, Period.  
Actually, you can look it up. There are those that do.  
In the context of the Bible marriage can only be between a man and a woman, there is really no debate about that, people weren’t even confused about the God ordained concept of marriage.  
And because of sexual immorality it is recommended that each man have his own wife and each wife her own husband.  
Against all kinds of sexual immorality, sir.
