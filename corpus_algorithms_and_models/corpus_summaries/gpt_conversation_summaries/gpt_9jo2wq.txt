I've heard similar things explaining why men who are homophobic have such a big problem with gay men. It's not so much that they mind two gay men doing consensual activities together. It's that they fear that a gay man might treat them the way they would treat a woman. It's okay (in their mind, not in reality) for them to treat a woman this way, but them being treated like that would be horrible.  
It's definitely stupid, but there are some men who feel this way. (Not me. What two guys, two ladies, or a man and a lady do together is fine by me as long as it's consensual and nobody is getting hurt.)  
Some people have an inherent disgust at the image of two men being sexual. This probably comes from the idea of imagining yourself in that situation, and is similar to thinking of other disgusting sexual practices, such as sex with an old person, child, bestiality, etc.  
And PART of the reason they feel this is way is because they were teased or bullied as being "homo" when younger. As long as "homo" is a slur, it gets associated with feelings of worthlessness.  
Another cause for homophobia is actual feelings of homosexuality, of course, in which one is socially conditioned to thinking it's wrong (similar to above), and they react via social appearance of disgust.  
I think there is a fairly popular idea that "women could do it better" that's both ignorant and disconcerting when talking about leadership. A ruling class will always be shitty, no matter which generally or race.  
I think you might be missing the point of the quotation; the problem is that men (allegedly) assume that a female uprising will result in female rule; "uprising" does not necessarily mean for the purpose of lordship, to usurp and/or concentrate power, or reverse the direction of oppression.
