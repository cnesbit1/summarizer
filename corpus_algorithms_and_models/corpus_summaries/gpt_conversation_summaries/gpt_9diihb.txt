It will though. These things don't just stop at rich foreigners with empty houses. Lots of Vancouverites are going to be going through financial disasters if this continues. If the bubble bursts it'll be a disaster for home owners. People do own all of this property you want to plummet in value and most of them actually live there (64% of vancouverites own their home as of 2017). What do you think losing 30-40% of the value of your largest investment will do to consumer spending in Vancouver? This in turn creates a snowball effect. Now John the RV salesman and all of his friends lost their job and he can no longer go for dinners so Jims restaurant takes another hit, and on and on and on... Canada wide, house hold debt is a massive problem so it's not looking great. These things tend not to be as isolated as people expect. With how much spending is driven by home equity I would not be surprised to see this decline impact other areas of the market; and the impact their will be spread to even more areas. Big financial stress can occur at mortgage renewal. If your house price drops to the point that the house is no longer a viable security for the mortgage, banks could refuse to renew the mortgage or renew at a much higher interest rate. Interest rates are supposed to go up and housing prices going down is bad news for a lot of Canadian home owners. Because a lot of money is made in construction, housing, and real estate, all of which will go to shit if the housing market tanks.
