Pretty sure more than half of Canadians have credit cards. A lot of Canadians are (stupidly) already carrying a balance on their cards, and even if they weren't their cards might not be able to cover their living costs for two weeks. Lack of impulse control mixed with poor financial habits and a large case of FOMO, that’s my problem anyways. My credit limit is probably half my annual salary, so I could potentially live off that for some time. I’m nearly a year into being able to finally do this. It was a grind to get here, but now that I’m here it feels great. Haven’t had interest hit my CC statement in 10 months. I needed to pay for something in an emergency and now I’m fucked because it’s sitting at max (only 3 grand) but at 20% interest I can’t make it go away at what I make. Got laid off a few years ago, could land another job for almost a year and had no other source of money. Almost hit $7000 before I had a job to make minimum payments. I've had student friends who would live on their cards for the year and work their asses off in summer to pay it back just in time. Ya the banks will loan you enough to hang yourself, and then if they figure out you lost your job they pull the chair out from under you. Bad plan. Consider a consolidation loan or a balance transfer. Consolidation loans are great and are fairly easy to get (we did one through a credit union, not sure if banks are more hesitant to approve them).
