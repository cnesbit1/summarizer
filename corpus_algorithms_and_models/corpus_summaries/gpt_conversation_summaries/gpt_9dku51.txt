Maybe he's hoping to gain some leverage from the trade deadline. But that's a risky move for sure.  
The thing with this is Karlsson holds all the cards here.  
The whole basis of this big return is based on Karlsson signing an extension with the respective team that is willing to trade, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he will want to sign an extension with the teams that are actively trying to make a trade with the Senators.  
That's why the maximized return thing could end up screwing the club itself, but it's a risk Dorion is willing to take.  
Worked out well for Sakic, but doesn't mean it always works out well.  
We know there was a 6 piece offer made with conditional picks on karlsson signing long term, and it was rejected. That's it.  
Yes, when Duchene made it clear he wanted a trade he still had 2+ years left on his contract.  
Karlsson's situation happened with only a year left on the contract and Dorian has a literal deadline to do something next season.  
It's so much more than that though. For what Dorion wants, he needs a contender that's so good they'll be able to give up real pieces off their NHL roster that won't hurt their chances as well as having a strong farm system.
