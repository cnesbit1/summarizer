It was honestly such an amazing experience. Me and my fwb didn’t do anything in the club, but being around and talking to people so open about sex was incredible. It was a club full of people appreciating the magic of sex and what it can make you feel, and it was a wholly positive environment. If you’re ever considering going to a sex club, after a lot of thought and ensuring this is the right time for you, I would highly recommend it. I can’t wait to go again! Generally not, it's not that kind of club. Worst case call ahead when it's early and see if anything special is going on or check their website Swinger clubs It depends. Some want SLS or local membership, others want you to pre-register for events, others have open doors. Some have combinations of these. Make a profile on fetlife. Go to local munches. Become part of the community. Do not go in expecting to find a harem for yourself with dozens of people willing to please you; that's not how it works. The people in this community are sexual deviants(freaky sex is fucking great), but they're also people with lives, jobs and other interests outside of kinky fucking. Treat them as such and you'll go far. If you go to a swing club or the right parties there ARE people there willing to please and be pleased. People are there to fuck, period. In the BDSM world it is more about munches, watching a scene, and more social chatting, less playing. Swinging is generally the exact opposite.
