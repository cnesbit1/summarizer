Are there more people out there who think that morning sex is extremely underrated? I mean, you're well rested, you're fresh, you have all the energy in the world plus you don't have any crap in your head from the entire day. Not taking away anything from night time sex, but I feel morning sex doesn't get its due. Anyone?

That said, I'm totally in favor of the morning sexs. My morning breath is horrible. I have always wondered what people who partake in the morning sex do about this just don't kiss on the mouth?

When you're horny enough you won't even notice it. Not all positions are face to face :)

Reverse cowgirl and/or doggy. All of the fun without breathing on each other

There's almost certainly a good chunk of people with minimal morning breath, a little water to freshen up and they'll pass muster for a quickie in the morning with an interested party.

But the point of morning sex is being lazy and comfy! Getting out of bed =|= lazy or comfy.

I'm a firm believer that when both people have morning breath it's like offsetting penalties. Ignored.

Sexual arousal is actually well known to inhibit the disgust reflexes we have, so this is likely very true!

We brush our teeth first nowadays. We used to be able to ignore morning breath but familiarity breeds contempt.

Spoon usually

Sex from behind!!

Morning sex is what the lazy dog (what we call spooning doggy style) position was made for!!
