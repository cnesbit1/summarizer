Your edit is why I only use a full face helmet.  
From a guy who went face first into a Mazda at speed back in April, ALWAYS wear a full face. It literally saved my life (and my face)!  
Edit: Yes I still got messed up. Broke a hand, my pelvis shattered (got it bolted back together), broke a leg and foot. Didn't wear proper boots, valuable lesson learned...  
I don't even see half/three quarter helmets as actual helmets. I'd rather not lose my ability to eat/drink/speak/sleep comfortably. That is if you don't lose your jaw.  
Bingo! And I used to wear one of those half helmets. Until I saw a few videos like this one.  
Yep. I'd rather sweat than bleed.  
It's been quite an ordeal. Thankfully I'm only 37 and I was in good phys health when I got hit. Young lady on a cell phone crossed center on 2 Lane hwy... I lost mo's of work, underwent 2 surgeries (I now have a 5" titanium lag bolt thru my pelvis) and I'll have another on my foot this fall.  
Thank God I'm a lucky one b/c I have very little back pain and 5 mo's later life is almost back completely to normal! At least until my next for surgery...  
I slid for a bit after hitting a deer. Burned through my jeans and leather jacket but my full face helmet saved my face from damage.
