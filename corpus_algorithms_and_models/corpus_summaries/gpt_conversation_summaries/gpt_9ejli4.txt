Well, i first have to explain that my girlfriend and i dont have sex yet, we want to wait a little longer. But we do other stuff, one of them is grinding on eachother.

We are on the beach and we find a nice spot at the end where the rocks form a little harbor and its pretty shallow. Theres nobody in sight, so we decide to start making out in the water, she gets on top of me and we start grinding, everything feels good but his is where the fuck up happens. We are both wearing bathing suits and *apparently* ocean water isnt a very good lubricant. As i get up i feel a sharp pain in my penis and a warmth in my pants. She screams because theres a small stain of blood on my pants. I look inside and see that my head is bleeding. The first thing i do is jump back into the water to "disinfect it" and let me tell you, that pain was the worst pain ive ever felt in my penis. I started tearing up. Shes screaming sorry from the shore as im trying not to drown and hoping the sharks have mercy on me.

Later that night i decided to inspect it. No broken urethra, but it looks like someone used 80 grit sandpaper on my head. It is dark red and sort of flattened out on the bottom left side.

Every step i take hurts. Every time i sit, it hurts, putting vaseline on it hurts, *looking* at it hurts!

Update: its steadily healing! It doesnt hurt to walk or touch it directly anymore. The texture is like the surrounding skin again. And its only slightly redder than the reast of the head. Thank you to everyone that commented and gave me advice, i apreciate it!
