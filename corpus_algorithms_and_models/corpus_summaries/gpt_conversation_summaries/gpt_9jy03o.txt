I have a condition called uterus didelphys. This means my reproductive system is split down the middle by a septum, creating two sides to everything. Two vaginal canals, two cervixes, two uteri, which lead to their own fallopian tube and ovary.

At the end of July I decided to have the septum retracted in my vagina to form one canal. The surgery was non-invasive but the recovery period was about a month and a half. During this time I completely evaded my vagina, I masturbated very infrequently, and going off to college and leaving my boyfriend reaffirmed that I wouldn't be having sex for a while.

SO, we had sex last night/this morning, and LEMME TELL YOU SOMETHIN. I FEEL LIKE A BRAND NEW WOMAN! I essentially lost half of my virginity because like damn I was missing out. Compared to before I had surgery, the feeling I had during sex was about 10-20% of the feeling now. And he was able to get to my G-Spot! AND I CAME VAGINALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME DURING SEX!!! If you took all of the times I had sex before the surgery and added them up, they wouldn't add up to how last night felt.

I had (have?) uterus didelphys too! But I had the septum removed before I lost my virginity because I had a huge ovarian cyst blow up one fallopian tube so they found my condition pretty early and decided to fix it. Do you have one kidney too?

Itâ€™s interesting you mention the kidney. I also have uterus didelphys, but I was born with 3 kidneys.
