If he doesn't care about net neutrality and wants to put us of the mercy of ISP's, that's worse than inviting 2 million immigrants a year into this country.  
Bernier is an idiotic fucking dinosaur.  
Don't forget 0 environmental policies and a slew of tax cuts for the wealthy.  
If people were expecting anything other than your local nutty libertarian party policies they'll be disapointed.  
Imagine being so boomered up that your internet matters more than the people of your country.  
Many people have been freaking out about net neutrality but with the US as an example I haven't heard of ISPs charging ridiculous rates for case by case website access.  
Because he's the only politician that cares about the people?  
Pretty sure Canada is already one of the harder countries in the world to immigrate to due to our selection process.. What these "nationalists" really want is race based selection and to stop taking refugees in.  
did he say he wants to end NN? All I saw is he wants to scrap the CRTC and open up Canada to more competition.  
It's pretty clear that the CRTC is a joke and should be dismantled. We just keep adding to the list of rules for ISPs, rules that only the big 3 can make work and no other new ISP could emerge from.  
You're right in that they're interested in making the most amount of money. The issue is, is that anyone who keeps to current standards will have a competitive advantage, which will translates to more money.
