The implication here is that Russian operatives are getting their links approved and upvoted on T_D, and that the admins are covering it up. So the Admins are compromised by Russia and are pro-Trump. Got it.

These are the same admins that allow hundreds of "against hate" subreddits to continue to exist and spam the frontpage with anti-Trump articles on a daily basis. ShareBlue is allowed to manipulate posts through their PAC. The politics subreddit is astroturfed to hell and back, for liberal posts.

So which is it? Are the admins complicit in promoting pro-Trump messages, or are they anti-Trump? Is it bad to have Russian propaganda upvoted, but ok when it's American propaganda?

The admin deal is manufactured uproar to blow up this silly and inconsequential post trying to make r/t_d look like they are all russian bots when in reality these websites are tiny and only get like 100 upvotes but apparently its a massive conspiracy.

Honestly though, saying that the admins can't be pro Trump because they allow anti Trump stuff is just as retarded as saying that the admins can't be anti Trump because they allow pro Trump stuff. Basically, it's extremely retarded.

The admins want as much traffic on reddit as possible. They don't care what you political alignment is.

If I had to bet on the admins being smarter than everyone is giving them credit for the reason this is really no big deal to them is every subreddit could be at some point we considered under the influence of bot groups if we use this amount of evidence as a standard of proof.

They Arent working for Russia. They are trying to cover up their fuck up

The entire point of this thread is about the Russian conspiracy/bots and how it affected the election. That’s why the op mentioned the part of the admins are covering it up didn’t make sense because of the constant hate/anti-trump/whatever that reaches the front page on a daily basis. Why go through such lengths for no apparent reason.

Honestly, this is the most likely case. Much more likely than Reddit admins being in bed with Russia.
