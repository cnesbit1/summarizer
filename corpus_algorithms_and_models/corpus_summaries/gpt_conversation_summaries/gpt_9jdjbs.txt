Honestly this entire preseason for the Sharks has felt more like using EK as a marketing gimmick as opposed to a team member. 

At a certain point, big acquisitions in the offseason are generally marketing gimmicks if you think about it. 

Plus Karlsson is the kind of player that can jump right back into NHL level hockey and take it in stride, he doesn't need the preseason to get back up to speed like some other guys, so it's better to give the ice time to some players that *might* make the team to give them a chance to prove themselves. 

The whole point of improving the team is to make more money... 

No shit we're going to market him, we just acquired one of, if not the best defenseman in the league right before the start of the season. 

Karlsson being traded was a big deal because he's a star player. 

Because I absolutely said that. My point is that the team is using him for ticket sales more than integrating him into the actual game and systems the sharks use right now. 

The entire point of the Leafs organization is to make money. 

All of the players in the Leafs organizations are being marketed, both directly and indirectly, in order to sell jerseys, hotdogs, beer, parking, tickets, and advertising. 

Of course they brought him out to reveal the new jersey, but that's about it. 

Just because everyone in the hockey world is talking about and is hyped in Shark territory doesn't mean they're just using him for marketing
