"She was not just fat. I mean to tell you what: I think she pumped iron probably an hour or so a day,” he said of the woman. “She literally could have played guard for the Green Bay Packers."

Morbid obesity is almost always caused by overeating and a lack of physical activity and saying so is not a prejudice.

Failing to care for one's body is, which is exactly what obesity is.

Yes, bad behavior should be condemned though the individual shouldn't be named, which they were not in this case.

Ultimately it's about secular prejudice. People like this pastor and the person I'm talking to just want to use Christianity to bully people, but it's not remotely coming from their perception of God. Hate is their god.

You should show love and kindness to your brother/sister in Christ. If they are sinning, inform them of it and help them to overcome it through positive love and support.

Shaming, condemnation, and fear aren't what Jesus asked us to do.

Mocking a woman for her appearance has nothing to do with worrying about her health.
