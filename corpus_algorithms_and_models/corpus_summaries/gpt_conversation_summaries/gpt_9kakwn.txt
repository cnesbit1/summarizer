I mean the "no cups" was at least better than "hey that player that consistently injures other guys on purpose lives rent free in your head." Like of course we're gonna bitch when tom Wilson injures our players a lot without significant consequence.  
Ehh, cracking jokes about the number of Cups is entirely different than cracking jokes about a cheap player dealing nasty hits.  
I'd say it was a very large majority of Caps fans defending this piece of garbage last season.  
Yeah I remember on the ZAR hit a good chunk of caps fans were defending it but I give them props now for this one, at least their fan base isnâ€™t catering to him anymore and all of us, caps fan or not, are in agreement this one was bad and he needs to cut this stuff out.  
No cups is just a factually accurate statement. "Rent free" is laughing about people having potentially career ending injuries.  
I'm not saying that they are cheering on dirty hits, I'm saying that last season most of them (On reddit) defended Wilson and his stupidity.  
Also, I'm not a Pens fan. Just thought I'd clarify that as well, it's not just PIT fans who hate Tom Wilson.  
Imagine thinking "but you mocked our no cups" is a good counter to it being pointed out that people were mocking head trauma.  
You're not even hating on Tom Wilson. You're hating on our entire fanbase for having Wilson on our team.
