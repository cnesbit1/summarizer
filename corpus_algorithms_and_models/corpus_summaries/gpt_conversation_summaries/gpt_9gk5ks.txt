Russia cannot be allowed to continue to flaunt international norms, invading countries and fomenting dissent in Eastern Europe. They cannot be allowed to normalise chemical weapons use. They cannot be allowed to continue along the path Putin has chosen.

Calling out Russian aggression is not demonising them, it's calling them to account. If they don't want to play nicely they don't get to play with the toys ( trade, movement of people etc).

I have no problem with Russian people, they are held under Putin's boot like many other people in totalitarian dictatorships and it is but a matter of time before the Russian people say enough is enough.

The annexation of Crimea was in direct response to western-backed coup in Kiev, backed by the US.

Open hostilities began with a large-scale Georgian military operation against the town of Tskhinvali and the surrounding areas, launched in the night of 7 to 8 August 2008.

Russia has very little access to warm water ports for military use and for shipping and access to shipping lanes year round. Out of the very few year round shipping ports, one is on the Crimean Peninsula, and another is in Syria.

Yes absolutely this issue is complex and multi faceted but Russia has had ample opportunities for rapprochement with the West, Putin was one of the first to offer help after 9/11 and it seemed like there was a way forward, although Bush snubbed him.

The US has wanted to overthrow Assad for years, for multiple reasons, and it was the US that massively aided the Ukrainian uprising against the Pro Russian leadership.
