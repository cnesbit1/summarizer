Subreddits dedicated to trump/Q have been getting banned, and it seems like they're all funneling here. Is this organic or is this something to be concerned about? Could /r/Conspiracy get banned due to this recent influx of politically biased posts? I've also been seeing a lot of things being upvoted like crazy that normally wouldn't be here (at least in my opinion) I agree. Q is so obviously bullshit. If he wasn't, something would've happened by now. And I noticed an increase in Q posts. I do wonder if you're correct that they want us banned. FISA just got declassified. We’ve heard about that forever from Q. Also, anons recently asked Q to post to 8chan at the same time as a Trump tweet. And it happened an hour later! The exact same minute. Just more evidence that has been piling up. So Pamphlet’s team were ready to fire off a tweet as soon as they see one from POTUS??? Does this “proof” make you suspicious because “proof” is supposed be substantial. Even his Xmas pics from the WH are suspicious. And it’s just a coincidence that Q said the MOAB would come linked to a red carpet event. Emmys were last night, same as FISA DECLAS. There are hundreds of these ‘coincidences’ but you are welcome to not believe. Riddles are all I hear about this Q group, which is the most telling part. If you haven’t figured out how fake this is, there’s nothing I can say to convince you. Step back and take an objective view is the monetized movement called Q. Yes, history is being made...while Pam makes $$$$ off the Q movement. They’re right—follow the money!!
