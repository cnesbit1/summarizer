The Kings were about to trade Richards to one of the Oilers/Flames. I can't find the twitter but I remember it had a quote from Chia or Treliving confirming they were able to trade for Richards when Lombardi suddenly cancelled the trade because Lombardi found out about Richards border incident.

Lombardi could have traded Richards away and let him be another team's cap issue but shut down trade talks because he didn't want to screw another team over. Lombardi also had a chance to completely get rid of Richards' cap with the compliance buyout but Richards promised that he would get his game back together.

The situation changed quickly. Richards’ name came up in trade talks over the weekend at the NHL draft, but according to ESPN, Kings general manager Dean Lombardi learned of an unspecified incident involving Richards and ended discussion.

Edmonton GM Peter Chiarelli told ESPN that Lombardi “came right over to me. He pulled me aside and said, ‘Hey, Pete, this is going to come out. I had no idea.’’’

Not to mention, it’s not to mention anyone *wanted* Richards (and his massive contract) at the time. IIRC, the Kings placed him on waivers earlier in the year, and got no takers. The Kings likely would have given up a pretty good pick/prospect to a team to take Richards off their hands, so Lombardi took the easier out when it was presented to him.

If you want to say he was loyal, that's fine. But you can't honestly say he has a lot of integrity after the voynov incident.
