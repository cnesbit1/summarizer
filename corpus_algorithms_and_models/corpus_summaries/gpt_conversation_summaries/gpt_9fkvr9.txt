There is absolutely no reason to have more than two children in this day and age, barring any dramatic, unforeseen circumstances.  
There is absolutely no defense for the large family model.  
There are plenty of children to adopt, and as you correctly pointed out, foster.  
I'm curious as to why the arbitrary cutoff between upstanding citizen and selfish, wasteful zealot is 2 children... why not 1? Or none since you could always adopt?  
Overpopulation has a huge environmental impact you know. Not having children is literally one of the best things you can do for the environment.  
Not having children is a completely rational solution. Explaining to others the impact that not having children can have is a completely rational solution.  
I have only mentioned the environmental impact of having children, not the moral implications, so you're using the word antinatalist incorrectly.  
The philosophical definition for anti-natalism is assigning a negative value to birth, which you are doing with regards to environmental means.  
The entire basis is that point blank telling people to never have kids is just ineffective and a waste of time.  
I support zero population growth, I'd never even heard of anti-natalism until you said it.
