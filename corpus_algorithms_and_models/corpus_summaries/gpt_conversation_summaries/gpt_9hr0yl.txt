They did not evaluate him properly.  
Lavi mismanaged the goal tending situation between Bob, Leighton and Boosh down the stretch and through the playoffs, refusing to put his trust in Bob. After they got bounced in the finals the owner essentially demands they get the best FA goalie out there so Leighton is dropped, Bryz is added for a ton of money eventually meaning Bob has no future with the team and thus gets traded away. Bryz fails, Leighton sucks and Boosh is old. Tada, standard Flyers Goalie Issue.  
It's more than that, though. Look at the stats. When they've been on the ice they have still been below average. I get that you have an axe to grind with Bryz but it doesn't change the fact that the Flyers have done nothing but miss on goalies for 20 years.  
Honestly, I don't think Reese had any idea how to evaluate a goalie like Bobrovsky. Imagine if he'd been asked to do a report on, say, Hasek.  
Beyond that, it seems like the only goalies he could ever work with were goalies who were big that he could get to sit back in their net and wait for the puck to come to them. A goalie like Bobrovsky who's naturally aggressive and needs to make himself larger by attacking the puck a bit and moving more was completely outside of Reese's expertise.  
The funny part is that Ian Clark has always struggled with that side of things; he's an absolutely superb technical coach, but his idea of goalie therapy is a 6-hour video session, not a round of golf and a bunch of questions in the clubhouse about how your kids are doing.
