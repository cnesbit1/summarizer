They'll say misinformation is necessary, which is Q's built in out for everything that fails.  
IIRC I believe Q said it was deliberate misinformation, as the baddies were also reading Q posts.  
There are 365 days in the year.  The date he choose had a MAJOR MAJOR happening with the arrests of the Saudi Princes.  Go back and looks at the drops prior to that date.  The name listed first in most drops was SA.  
Could be a coincidence but one thing is certain Q picked the EXACT day of MAJOR arrests.  
May have been it. Perhaps much of what I was reading were interpretations. May have been something like pics of them wearing boots and then asking when was the last time they left the country. I may have been wrong in stating what was specifically stated, but the breadcrumbs (imho) were dropped with the intention of leading people to a specific conclusion.  
BTW, did you notice the new Q proof? On April 24th I believe, in response to anon asking when we would see MOAB. Q alludes to the Emmys and rolling out the red carpet. Well, we all know what happened last night, FISA release!  
You are correct about the Nunes memo tho. We will soon find out if the FISA lives up to the hype.  
Because he posted about the red carpet on April 30 and the daytime emmys with red carpet were on April 30. This isnâ€™t rocket science.  
yes, because you choose not to believe and assume it is all coincidental. you ask questions but refuse to listen to the answers.  
first, they never gave the exact date of whom would be arrested. that was all assumed based off echo chamber chatter. The dates he has called have been spot on. So please turn down your turbo jets and go with the flow.
