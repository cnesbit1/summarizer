You are right that it is worded broadly. It's the politically correct appeal to the masses answer for most occasions. 

The problem with pedophillia is the victims involved are at an impressionable age and are not mentally and sexually ready to engage in intercourse or even understand what they are giving consent for. Yes, you can have care and compassion for them, but you don't have to support behaviours which allow them to prey on the innocent. 

yes this!! and besides, the photo above states that the buddha advocates for all to spread care, compassion &amp; empathy! That includes having pedophiles to spread those core values. If they aren't actively hurting the vulnerable that's totally fine, but if they are, they are taking a step away from those values. 

true. If they aren't using their urges as an excuse to hurt children, then of course they do deserve empathy and care. Hurting someone else because of their urges should not be okay, **hurting someone else without consent for your own pleasure is not okay**. Autistic or not. 

But what I've been trying to say here is that there should not be the conflating of homosexuals and pedophiles. There is nothing close to similar about the two, and should not be used as an argument against homosexuals. 

The idea is you can be the absolute worst scumbag in the world and a buddhist will still accept you into society. He will not cause any harm or suffering even in the name of justice or vigilantism. Karma and retribution will see to that, for it is not in anybody's authority to pass your own judgement.
