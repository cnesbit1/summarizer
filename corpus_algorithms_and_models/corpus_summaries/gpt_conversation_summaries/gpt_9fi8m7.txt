We both are in our mid twenties and not capable to have a child, financially or maturity wise. I have 300 extra dollars a month and have to start paying health insurance in January, cutting that in half. I’m in 70k worth of student debt. We always talked if this were to happen, we would terminate until we were on our feet.

I knew something was off and just knew I was pregnant. I never really understood when people said they just knew. I took a test the second I got home from my work conference yesterday and it showed up so fast. Another showed the same.

My boyfriend is beyond consolable. I am having to be strong for the both of us and I am upset too. It’s not an easy decision but it’s also not feasible right now. He is telling me he can’t even look at me without thinking our baby is inside of me. He says he doesn’t think he can assist me to the appointment. He says he doesn’t think our relationship will make it through this if I follow through. All this is being dumped on me while I’m also in shock and disbelief.

Can anyone please give me encouraging stories or just abortion experience stories. I read about “how much regret I’m going to feel” and I have a friend who has always told me she regretted hers. When I looked at that test, I never thought of the possibilities. I instantly just knew I wanted to terminate. No romanticizing. I am not ready to be a mother. But it may mean my relationship is over when I need my partner most.

The abortion i made was very easy. Took my bicycle to the hospital, changed to a robe, got anasthesia, woke up after 10 minutes, put on my clothes and bicycled home. That was all and i felt very relived. And the man i was with confessed later that he made me pregnant so i wouldnt leave him and allways stay at home. Haha, guess who got a divorce right after that?

My mom had an abortion in her 20s because she wasn't ready to be a mother yet. Then once she was married, financially stable, and had planned to have a kid, at age 30 she had my oldest brother. Then proceeded to have 3 more kids. She has told me she never regrets the abortion. It allowed her to make the family she wanted on her own terms, and we all turned out better for it. It sounds like you already know what you want to do, OP,
