Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for. 

Hopefully with the help of all the riders no question will go unanswered. Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all. 

Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are. 

Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle. 

As always please remember to read the FAQ. 

This thread will be refreshed each Monday. 

I am a strong supporter of full-face helmets. I can tell you what to look for in a good, safe helmet. First, the shell should be made of fiberglass, carbon, carbon fiber or some combination of the three. Second, you want to look for a helmet with a lot of shell sizes. The more shell size the better the fit. Don't buy a helmet where a small and large share a shell size. 

Yes, Revzilla a reputable store. I do recommend going to a physical store for your helmet though unless you know what size you are and the shape of your head. 

Stay away from protection gear from the HD store online. Find something with a Snell rating. Even if a store is a bit out of the way go get fitted for a helmet that way you know your size and can buy it online.
