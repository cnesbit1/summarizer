I (34f) had a baby a year and a half ago. Now when I have sex with my (40m) husband, I cant feel anything when he penetrates me. The first time we had sex after the birth (7 weeks or so) it was painful. No cesarean, but I did have an episiotomy. My OBGYN had an intern that she let stitch me up, and I wasn't very happy with the results. I brought it up at my 6 week follow up apt and she said 'this is just the new normal'. Look into pelvic floor physio, it helped me immensely. If they fucked up the stitch you may need it to be redone. If that isn't the case get some pelvic floor physical therapy... Ask your doctor for a referral. There are pelvic floor physiotherapists that you see who help you figure out what the issues are and how to do exercises properly to fix them. I wish I'd known about it after my first baby. I'm definitely going to look into it.
