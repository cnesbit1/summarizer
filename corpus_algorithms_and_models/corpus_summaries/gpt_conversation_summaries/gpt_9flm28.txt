Lily told her she was a werewolf Claire just went along with it because, hey, this was the only person who would talk to her. Lily is really a terrible person (into bestiality and such), so Claire just messes with her on the whole werewolf thing. Claire walked in on Lily's dog licking her, lol. I think that's illegal? Maybe you guys should tell someone. it is illegal in my state, but there's not really anything we can do about it. And do... what? it's not like I have any evidence. The only person who knows she's into that is my friend. But thats so damn messed up. This doesn't even seem like a phase, maybe you guys should try to talk to her about it, explain why its wrong.
