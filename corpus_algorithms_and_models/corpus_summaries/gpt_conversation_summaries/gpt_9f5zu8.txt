On the first day of moving into my new house back in April of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn't long before I deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. 

After losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my BBQ exploding on my birthday gathering, I was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. 

The next memory I have is of shouting. 

The bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars. 

The ringleader then demands that I give him the bag of money. 

This exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour. 

Still, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, I wasn’t entirely keen on sending them next door. 

“Is this number 27?” he demanded to know. 

“WE’VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!” 

The ringleader then apologised. 

Little did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour's door in and storming his house. 

The police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. 

The rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. 

The only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my Leatherman (it had 'That's not a knife' engraved in it). 

I know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but [it would appear I’ve got back-up on that front](https://ol.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on Reddit and confirmed the story's validity on my original post!
