2 seasons of Panarin&gt; 4 seasons of Saad at the same cap hit.  
Tbf, they had 2 seasons of Panarin and didn't win a playoff series.  
I meant Chicago.  
Considering he signed an extension for 6 instead of just using the Oâ€™Reilly method to reach UFA faster that was a good sign already he would have stayed  
those regularly scheduled playoff battles still feel like yesterday  
Not when Chicago was going to lose Panarin for nothing at the end of his deal and they had just lost Hossa forever. I don't know what it is people don't understand about that trade and why it has to be explained every single time.
