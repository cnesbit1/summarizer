Unsure why this perfectly reasonable comment is downvoted. Obviously, the Flyers would balk at that price, but you have to give to get. Patrick+ is what I'd ask if I were Kekäläinen.  
Guys. I'm not saying I agree with this offer. I'm saying Jarmo probably asked for a ton for an inter division team that were gonna compete with for a playoff spot. Christ.  
It's not the trade deadline. A whole year headstart on pitching a Top 5 player to sign long term with you, and play with a 100pt playmaker during the end of a rebuild/start of contention is not a rental. Panarin is himself a young stud, and you don't trade him to a divisional rival for cash considerations. Basically, I don't think there's a possible trade between these 2 clubs that involves Panarin.  
Him saying he wants to be a UFA next year is a huge hit to his trade value. If he left the door of signing an extension open, it'd be a different story.  
He wasn't suggesting that's what they'd get for him, he's just saying that could be something they asked for.  
Didn't Ottawa have larger asks in the potential TBL deal? And I wouldn't use the Karlsson trade which everyone declared a fleece immediately as the bar here. Ottawa HAD to move him and everyone knew it. Panarin is rumored to be heading out this off-season but he hasn't said anything outright.  
The general train of thought is that we should keep both Russians and make a playoff run.  
Columbus is also a real contender, they haven’t traded a lottery pick, their owner isn’t a cheap bastard, Panarin doesn’t hate the owner, Columbus has a year to convince him to stay.  
You're getting downvoted because "we disagree!" But you're totally right, no one is trading a u23 top 6 budding star for **ONE YEAR** of Panarin...who apparently all of a sudden is a top 5 player lol guy isn't even a top 5 LW.  
Yeah same here. Konecny is my favorite player on the team and a core stud player for a very long time. Not worth giving him up for a 27 yr old UFA imo.  
Top 5 player in the NHL? Top 5 left winger, maybe. Even still you've got Ovechkin, Benn, Marchand, Hall, Giroux, Gaudreau.
