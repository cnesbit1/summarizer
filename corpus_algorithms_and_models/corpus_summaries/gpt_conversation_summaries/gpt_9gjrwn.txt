Feel free to ask any motorcycle related question, no matter how trivial or dumb you might think it is. The point of these posts is to ask and answer questions you wouldn't want to make a separate post for. Everyone is encouraged to contribute with either questions or answers and hopefully we will be able to rid of motorcycle ignorance once and for all. Please remember to be courteous as we want to encourage people to ask questions, no matter how 'dumb' some may think they are. Another great place to try is /r/SuggestAMotorcycle. As always please remember to read the FAQ. Who knows - if your question is deemed to be helpful it may be added to the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_a_good_starter_bike.3F) (which you should read)! This thread will be refreshed each Monday. I've put a couple years and thousands of miles into my first motorcycle, a 2003 KLR 650. I've loved the riding position, visibility, and maneuverability but I'm ready for more power. I often just don't feel like I have enough, especially on the highway or with a passenger. Please recommend me a new bike! Some features I'm looking for include: - Tall friendly (I'm 6'6") - Relatively neutral sitting position - Top case compatible - Pillion friendly - $10k-ish price range (used is fine) - Comfy for commuting and some highway driving - Preferably low/easy maintenance Some bikes I'm considering include: - Honda CB 1100 EX - Yamaha Super Tenere - Yamaha Tracer 900 - Suzuki V Storm 1000 - Kawasaki Versys 1000 Bikes I like price range be damned! (looking at used though unsure what mileage/state is ok): - Honda VFR1200x - KTM 1090 Adventure R - Triumph Tiger - BMW R 1200 GS (or the smaller models in the R family) - Yamaha FJR1200 - Ducati Multistrada Note a bunch are very similar to my KLR just more powerful. I'd like something more commutery and less off roady though it seems like the more off road a bike is the more affordable/maintainable? I *really* like the look of standards and scramblers (that old school simple look) but none seem very pillion/luggage/tall friendly... Any help or suggestions are welcome. Thanks! If you don't need any off-road capabilities: - Versys 1000 -
