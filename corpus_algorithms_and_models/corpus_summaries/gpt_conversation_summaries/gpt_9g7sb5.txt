If every player CURRENTLY ACTIVE reverts back to the age of 18, who’s your top 5?  
For me it’s  

1. Sidney Crosby.  
This picks imo makes sense, highest PPG of an active player, natural born leader and can score goals too. 2 Conn Smythes, has an edge to him and can turn on a dime again and again, and ofc, he’s Captain Canada.  

2. Connor McDavid.  
This kids special, coming first in the league in scoring on a team that can’t make the playoffs, his explosiveness and speed are unmatched and his hands are silky.  

3. Evgeni Malkin.  
The most important skater position in hockey is the centre, and Malkins a big one, literally. He isn’t afraid to get physical at times, and despite his hot temper, puts up a LOT of points.  

4. Alexander Ovechkin.  
Hey look, not a center. Ovi’s a explosive goal scorer, and has a huge trophy case.  

5. Erik Karlsson.  
Call it recency bias if you will, but Erik Karlssons a magnificent player.  

So that’s my list but I definitely have some bias and also number 5 was harder for me, I feel like the first 4 are the elite of the elite currently and then you have to go from there.  
1.  Crosby  

2.  McDavid  

3.  Thornton  

4.  Kane  

5.  Lundqvist.  This is probably a bit crazy, but I don't know maybe it's just a gut feeling.  

I do admit I have some anti-Ovechkin bias, but him and Karlsson easily got 6-7 for me.
