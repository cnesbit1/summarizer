Guess what... if Ford gets away with it here in Ontario, how long do you think it will be until other people start trying it? The door will be opened and if it’s not shut down quickly, there will be no way to stop it.  
Because *nothing ever happens in Saskatchewan* and its fun to watch the garbage fire from afar.  
Don't laugh too hard, you guys are the next to go to crazy town.  
I'm glad that in Quebec we don't have those nutjobs in major parties. Sure, they are far from perfect but still way better than this.  
Thats because you guys are generally more engaged and get pissed off (and protest) way faster. Look at when they wanted to raise tuition by a few bucks...  
Go ahead and laugh. Wait till it happens to you, you stunned arsehole. Losing democratic rights is no laughing matter. Fool.

Saskatchewan already did it. We used s33 to restore funding to Catholic schools after the court told the province it shouldn't fund Catholic schools that were predominantly full of non-Catholic students.  
I just finished Yascha Mounk’s “The People vs. Democracy” and it scared the shit out of me. I hear you, am right there with you.  
Tax money to fund private catholic schools  
The state of emergency ended at least. But it's still fire season all around.
