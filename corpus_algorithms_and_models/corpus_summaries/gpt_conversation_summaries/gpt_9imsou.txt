IRS Commissioner **John Koskinen**testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform on March 26, 2014. Koskinen told **Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT)** during the hearing that Lois Lerner’s emails [**were archived**](https://twitter.com/jasoninthehouse/statuses/477582460146823168) and it would take a long time to retrieve them.

**In June 2014 the IRS told Congress** [**Lois Lerner’s emails were lost**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/06/after-a-year-of-delays-irs-says-they-lost-lois-lerners-emails-in-computer-crash/) **in a computer crash.**

But [**thousands of emails were later recovered**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2015/04/inspector-general-recovers-thousands-of-missing-lois-lerner-emails-that-irs-chief-said-were-lost/) by an Inspector General that were not previously produced for Congress.  
**The IRS leadership was targeting conservatives and lying about it to Congress.**

The emails confirmed Lerner [**funneled information on conservative groups**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/04/boom-emails-confirm-lois-lerner-funneled-info-on-conservative-group-to-democrat-cummings/) to at least one Democratic lawmaker.

There was no evidence ever found that linked Obama to what the IRS did and no criminal charges. 

The Republican Congress, led by Darrell Issa, conducted a long investigation and did not recommend any criminal charges,  the DOJ's Inspector General found no criminal activity.
