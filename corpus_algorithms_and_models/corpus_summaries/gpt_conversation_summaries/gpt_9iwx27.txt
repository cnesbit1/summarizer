he said it would be a good "starting point" for someone like me. Someone that he said is a little bit more midline or agreeable. I can see how from many perspectives that would be a joke, or bad, but all he was trying to do was tailor something for my mindset.

Nah, Rohr is a solid recommendation. And in my mind a much better recommendation than someone like C.S. Lewis.

Rohr mistakes new-age vocabulary for profundity. He's a lot like Matthew Fox. He shoehorns Christian theological vocabulary into the service of this nonsense, often claiming the Fathers are on his side when they are decidedly not. But, he writes for a popular audience - people whom Rohr knows will never check on his citations. He calls those of us who do "rigid" and such. We're just not spiritual enough to get what Rohr's on about.

University of Florida doesn't offer a doctorate in either of those fields - certainly not theology as it's a state school.

I used a general statement. He got his Ph. D from there. Don’t get on me on semantics dude. I didn’t ask what his exact degree was, I just asked where he studied and UFL was one of his answers.

He’s been a pastor and has been on a religious academia board in my area for thirty years. Just because he recommended a guy you don’t like doesn’t mean you need to try and discredit him.

I deleted it not because I was mad but because I figured it wasn’t worth clogging it up until I had solid answers for you, honestly.
