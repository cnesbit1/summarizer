I only believe in one God, but yes, it is possible that I’m wrong. I find belief in a deity to be more rational than no deity, and I find the God of Christianity to be the logical choice. Most religions are works based salvation. Christianity is the only faith based salvation. If we as humans are tainted by sin, we cannot remove that taint ourselves. For God to remove that taint on our behalf, we must consent to that removal. I would be steadfast, as there is plenty of other things that I see as evidence. While I don’t deny the possibility of some awful trial putting my faith to the test, I would like to believe I would continue to believe as I currently do, and that my faith would be strengthened. Closest thing I can think of is my recent interest in annihilationism, as mentioned in a different comment. It went from a borderline heresy to legitimate school of thought in my mind almost overnight.
