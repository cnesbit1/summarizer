Squid don’t have shells.  
You learn from your mistakes. For me it was a quick 2 minute ride to the gas station for fuel for later. But all it takes is a small gravel patch you dont see when you turn.  
Oh I know. Had plenty of road rash. Usually do dress like a turtle unless its 90 degrees. But at least still boots, jeans, and full faced helmet. Hadn't ever heard the term squid till I found Reddit  
Yeah, just regular jeans wont do much. My jeans got fucked up from falling off a bike at like 10mph before, so I dont trust that for motorcycles at all. I have some kevlar lined jeans with knee protection for the bike - probably not great but better than nothing.  
Some say its derived from "squirrelly kid", but mostly it's

• Q uick  
• U nderdressed

The best explanation I've heard is that a squid is someone who wears a helmet and nothing else. After an accident, there's just a head with slimy appendages hanging out. And squid is easier to say than octopus.
