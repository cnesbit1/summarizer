There it is. An astronut saves the day -- again -- by plugging a hole in the space station with his thumb. Amazing how no one has died up there in nearly 20 years. Some will notice that this ridiculous story seems to be based on the "little hero of Holland" tale, where a Dutch boy plugs a leaky dike with his finger until help arrives, popularized in the 1865 book [*Hans Brinker.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Brinker,_or_The_Silver_Skates) Let there be no mistake: it's the exact same photo. Chris Hadfield posted a photo labeled as an official NASA photo which is from a Christian rock CD cover from 2014. I look forward to seeing the excuses put forth by the eternally faithful to the government organization called NASA. For the unbiased observer, take note: this is why we distrust NASA and doubt the things they say they do and the places they say they go....  it's because they *unendingly give us pure bullshit, all the time, and constantly lie to us and mock us.* Similar back in the Apollo days when NASA literally made the claim that they repaired the LEM with duck tape. There's a difference between a lander designed to work in space for a few days, and a space station designed to operate for decades. People think you are lying, but there are at least a couple Apollo "astronaughs" who made the claim the LEM was no thicker than a few layers of Reynolds aluminum foil.
