I'm probably overthinking this, but hey, I buy cute bras for a reason.

Edit: Thanks guys! Clear consensus seems to be no bra, which is the most comfortable state for both parties. ðŸ™ƒ

actually bras cause the muscles that make boobs curve upwards to atrophy and have no effect on sagging.

It depends on the size of the breast, perkiness comes from both the muscles and the connective tissues. Muscles can be exercised to strengthen them, but connective tissues will weaken with age no matter what.

Muscle atrophy will cause smaller breasts to sag faster (there was a French study on this iirc), bras can cause atrophy but this is often compensated by leading an active life, anything that works the pecs will generally work other supportive muscles too.

Larger breasts are going to sag no matter how strong the muscles are simply due to weight, hoisting them up with a bra reduces the time that your breasts are pulling on the connective tissues that allow them to be perky in the first place.
