I mean it was still crazy to think, crazy doesn't mean *impossible*. Vegas *did* beat the odds significantly, I don't think that can be argued Which it was. It was crazy to think a team of guys teams had to let go for free would be so dominant that they would make it to the playoffs, much less play as well as they did once there. A lot of those players would never have been let go under the old rules. Plus questionable traded with Vegas by other GMs. They ended up with a good team. It wasn't a fluke. I don't understand why people are so surprised they made the playoffs. The draft was designed to do that. I mean William Karlsson scored 70% of his career goals in 31% of his career games, adding 37 goals to his previous season total. I'm sure everybody else saw guys like that from their team they knew had potential but it was still an absolute Cinderalla run. Nobody on that team is as good as Kopitar or Doughty and Quick is the better goalie than Fleury every year except this one. Would you take any of the Knights over Carter either? The Kings are deep and that series, man, the fact they swept LA is still fuckin ludicrous to me. Out of all the stacked teams you guys have had it was the year you were expected to take a little step back that you won it all. This isn't basketball. "I have more stars" isn't a guaranteed win or even reasonably assured.
