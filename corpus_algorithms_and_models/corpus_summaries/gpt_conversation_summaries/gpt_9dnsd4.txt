They're still recommending bong over other methods.  
Easier on the lungs at least. Pipes can be harsh  
As long as you change your damn bong water...  
And put ice in it when you change it.  
Surprised they haven't switched to vaporizers.  
When I used to smoke (I don't any more because of personal reasons), it felt like a cleaner, cooler hit so to speak.  
An ex of mine used to put ice in their bong, and that was their reasoning.  
Iâ€™ve actually heard that putting ice in the bong can give you bronchitis some how.  
Gotta say it...switch to vaping and never look back  
i prefer edibles.  
Definitely don't mind am edible when I want to feel groovy for half the day. I referred to vaping in contrast to smoking of any kind.  
This is isn't necessarily true. That user clearly isn't educated in biology/pharmacology.  
The study he posts says this "**Although not all studies agree**, most of the available evidence from laboratory and clinical studies **suggests** that inhaled cold air, cooling of the body surface and cold stress induced by lowering the core body temperature cause pathophysiological responses such as vasoconstriction in the respiratory tract mucosa and suppression of immune responses, which are responsible for increased susceptibility to infections."**  
This study is taking into consideration cold winter air, not air/smoke passing over ice in a bong. I live in Canada. The air is cold for like half the year here. We're doing fine. Additionally, air passing over ice won't be as cold as air sitting at an ambient temperature of 20 below, which is par for the course for a Canadian winter.  
Pure coincidence, and its honestly super silly they suggest that the pneumonia was from an ice loaded bong. There are a myriad of other factors (environmental and genetic) that need to be considered. Pneumonia is a virus, which needs to be inhaled. They could have just gotten it from a friend who also used the bong, but that friend didn't have the virus in their lungs. If the temperature of air/smoke passing through ice is enough to make you susceptible to pneumonia, then people in cold climates would be generally fucked.  
I don't get high off edibles :(  
How is that possible.  
Edibles are great  
It certainly is. I have a degree in biotech and have taken pharmacology courses if you would like to discuss why it is.  
I smoke like a quarter a week
