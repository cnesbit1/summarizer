Cost my American girlfriend something like $700 to get her birth control filled on insurance.  
She is covered under both of her parents... Who are doctors.  
700 cad, and no that's what she pays out of pocket I believe. The same supply was 159 here.  
We paid $66 for 3 months of my wifes birth control. This is entirely out of pocket.  
The cost for Seasonique oral tablet biphasic extended cycle is around $742 for a supply of 182, depending on the pharmacy you visit.  
In the US I have a top notch PPO plan, my wife pays less than that per year for birth control under the plan.  
Your wife could be taking cheaper birth control.  
I have a company that operates on both sides of the border, depends on what you are doing if itâ€™s worth the hassle for a US expansion or not.  
Prices are for cash paying customers only and are not valid with insurance plans.  
Cheaper to raise a kid.  
Except that the company pays thousands a month...
