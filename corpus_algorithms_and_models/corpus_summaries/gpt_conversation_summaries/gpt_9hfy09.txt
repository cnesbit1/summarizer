It's not like he called a press conference just to make this statement; he was asked about it after the game and he can't throw his new teammate under the bus.  
NHL players have had a ton of media training, and I'm sure much of it is dedicated to how to respond to questions you don't want to answer.  
For another, "people on reddit" are not homogeneous and have a variety of views.  
There's a difference between showing your personality in interviews and straight up idiotic comments.  
Sticking up for a teammate in an already fragile lockerroom situation isn't a "fucking dumbass" comment.  
He's not going to go against his guys and become a target in the Montreal media just to get brownie points from pissed off people online.  
Everyone intellectually knows the deal here.  
So the correct response from a full-brained person would be either to call it stupid (too much to expect...and rightfully) or just move onto the next question by saying, “we’ll see what the league says”.  
All players get media training now, and Drouin has been in the spotlight since he was 15/16.
