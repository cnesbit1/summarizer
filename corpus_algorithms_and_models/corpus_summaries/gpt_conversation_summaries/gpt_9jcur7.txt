A good Catholic does not insult victims and their families by ridiculing those unable to stay in institutions that support their abusers.  
Fleeing from abuse and cover up does not make a person unfaithful.  
They're not unfaithful. They're faithful towards Christ and his teachings.  
Insulting those hurt by abuse will not win members back to the church. Reform and helping the victims will.

I think that those faithful fleeing the church and their abusers do not deserve your insults and ridicule.
