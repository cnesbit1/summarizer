Sure it's preseason but that was against Taylor Hall shorthanded.  
And on a quality NHL goalie  
I know the Rangers wanted Pettersson but I don’t think you guys are going to be too upset with Andersson.  
Damn what a year for rookies.  
It's gonna be so fun to watch these kids play and grow.  
If it’s against a player of that caliber, in that situation, the stage of season is completely irrelevant. Hell of a goal  
Andersson is going to be a gamer.  
How the fuck do they roof it so easily.  
Oh, and practice. Like, a lot of it.
